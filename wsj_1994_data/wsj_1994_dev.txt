THIS NEWSPAPER recently reported that sales of CD-ROM drives were soaring and were expected to continue doing so .
But the article also noted that market researchers believe many PC owners are n't using their CD-ROM drives , which allow computers to run software and read data stored on high-capacity platters resembling music CDs .
That may appear paradoxical , but it is n't as surprising as it seems .
I suspect most of those who possess , but do n't use , a CD-ROM drive did n't go out and buy one to add to their old machine .
Instead , they received the drive as part of the standard configuration of a new PC .
In fact , the CD-ROM drive is fast becoming part of the basic complement of features on all but the cheapest computers .
My guess is that these owners of idle CD-ROM drives think them useful only for playing the flashy multimedia entertainment and education software with which the term CD-ROM is most closely associated in the press .
If you ` ve reached this conclusion , think again .
There are lots of CD-ROM disks that do n't sing , dance or slay dragons , but just sit in your PC quietly providing volumes of useful information .
Some employ audio or video to augment their contents .
But they are mainly textual , not graphical , and use the disks ' vast storage capacity to provide business information or to support research .
Here 's a random selection of just a few of these dull-but-practical CD-ROMs I 've tried ; there are many more , in the same and other categories .
Most let you copy and\/or print selections from their contents .
Many lack a pretty interface , and some take more effort to learn to operate than the software I normally recommend .
But they just might give you a reason to use that CD-ROM drive you paid for .
There are a variety of phone and address directories available on CD-ROM , all of which use the computer 's power to store and rapidly search through mounds of data .
These combine local listings into broad national or regional databases , containing millions of names , addresses and phone numbers .
They let you search for people or businesses , even if you only know a part of the name or some other fragment of information .
ONE I TRIED recently is called the `` 11 Million Businesses Phone Book , '' from American Business Information , Omaha , Neb. .
This $ 40 disk claims to include `` virtually every business in the U.S. and Canada .
'' Using it , I was able to locate not only big businesses , but my neighborhood pet shop and the submarine-sandwich joint at the beach resort I just visited .
The disk permits you to retrieve 5,000 detailed listings for up to one year , after which it stops working and must be replaced .
The company offers a similar disk covering 70 million households .
Both are for PCs running MS-DOS or Windows .
These products and their competitors do n't generally include unlisted phone numbers .
Allegro New Media , Fairfield , N.J. , offers the searchable text of 12 business how-to books on a $ 60 CD-ROM called `` Business Library , Volume One .
'' The disk , for Windows , also contains three business-oriented videos .
The books are n't world-famous titles , but they cover advertising , marketing , sales , accounting , careers , real estate and my personal favorite : `` How to Get People to Do Things Your Way .
'' For $ 70 , you can get a CD-ROM that claims to list the names and contacts for every federal domestic-aid program , including `` federal grants , loans , services , scholarships , mortgage loans ... surplus property , government auctions and much more .
'' The disk , for MS-DOS and Windows , is called Information USA and is published by Infobusiness , Orem , Utah .
There are limitations to this disk , however .
I found I could only print the entries I wanted , not save them as text files or copy them for insertion into a word processor .
YOU CAN GET the full text of 1,750 great works of literature and other books and documents on a $ 129 CD-ROM for IBM-compatibles called `` Library of the Future , '' from World Library of Garden Grove , Calif. .
The disk includes all the works of Shakespeare , Aristotle , Twain , Chaucer and many others ; all the Sherlock Holmes mysteries ; the Bible , the Koran and the book of Mormon and the U.S. Constitution and Federalist Papers .
It 's a rotten way to read these works cover to cover , but a great way to search for key phrases and references across a vast range of titles .
An outfit called the Bureau of Electronic Publishing in Parsippany , N.J. , offers a competing $ 40 `` Great Literature '' CD-ROM for both IBM-compatible and Apple Macintosh computers with over 1,800 famous works of literature and nonfiction .
For those who just want the essence of the great books , especially students , the company also offers the famous Monarch Notes series of literary summaries .
The $ 50 Monarch disk includes nearly every book a teacher might assign and runs on both IBMs and Macs .
Other companies offer low-cost CD-ROMs containing thousands of fonts , illustrations and photos .
I recently picked up for under $ 20 a CD-ROM crammed with hundreds of inexpensive shareware programs .
Several companies now offer CD-ROMs that contain street maps of nearly every locality in America .
And the list goes on and on .
So , even if you 're not interested in multimedia , you can still get your money 's worth from that CD-ROM drive that came with your computer .
Some of your hipper friends will call you boring , but can they get the phone number of that place in Rehoboth Beach , Del. , that makes great Italian subs ?
I think not .
Microsoft Corp. and AT&T Corp. said they are broadening their joint effort to make Microsoft 's Windows NT operating system a standard for large-scale computing jobs .
The operating software is the key to Microsoft 's strategy for moving beyond the personal-computer business to take over tasks once handled by costly mainframe computers .
AT&T 's Global Information Solutions unit said it would add several mainframe-class features to Windows NT by the end of 1995 , including high-speed transaction processing and so-called high-availability technology for minimizing breakdowns .
Since the breakup of its longtime relationship with International Business Machines Corp. , Microsoft has been lining up other partners involved in running corporate-computer systems , including Digital Equipment Corp. .
The AT&T unit , which includes what used to be NCR Corp. 's computer business , is particularly important , because it concentrates on systems that use Intel Corp. microchips , a forte of Windows NT , said Steve Ballmer , Microsoft 's executive vice president .
William O'Shea , senior vice president of the AT&T unit , said about 200 potential customers are developing programs that would allow them to run major operations using Windows NT .
Kmart Corp. , for example , said it is working with AT&T to use Windows NT in place of a mainframe to help manage a network to allow employees at more than 4,000 locations to send electronic mail and other computerized files .
Microsoft 's sales job has a long way to go .
The company missed its original prediction that it would sell one million units in Windows NT 's first year on the market , which ended this summer .
Mr. Ballmer would n't specify unit shipments , but said the company sold `` hundreds of thousands '' of copies .
Among other things , the product required too much memory for most desktop PCs , and has become more popular in larger server machines .
But Mr. Ballmer said revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30 grew 70 % for the group of server products that includes Windows NT and the SQL Server database .
`` I 'm increasingly confident that it will grow at least that much again this year , '' he said .
Rick Sherlund , an analyst at Goldman Sachs , estimates sales for the group of products were $ 250 million in fiscal 1994 , or about 5 % of Microsoft 's total sales .
He said 70 % growth for the business should be easily attainable in view of rapid growth in the market .
Mr. Ballmer also disclosed that Microsoft may change the pricing scheme for Windows NT to get more revenue for server applications , which allow many PC users to use one copy of the software .
Windows NT has a street price of about $ 1,100 for servers and about $ 300 for workstations , he said .
The pricing scheme may be adjusted when Microsoft announces a new version of Windows NT , code-named Daytona , in the next 45 days , Mr. Ballmer said .
Mr. Sherlund expects the program to be shipped in October , to be twice as fast as the original version and to require 25 % less memory .
Separately , Microsoft said it has sold 800,000 units of its Access database program in the past three months , and more than 2 million units since it was first shipped in November 1992 .
SANTA CLARA , Calif. -- Visx Inc. said Aesculap-Meditec GmbH has agreed to license Visx patents for correcting vision and treating corneal disease with a laser .
Aeseculap-Meditec , a German maker of medical lasers , agreed to make a `` substantial '' payment for past infringement of Visx 's patents and pay royalties based on future sales , Visx said .
Precise financial terms were n't disclosed .
On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday , Visx shares closed at $ 19 , up $ 1.375 , or 7.8 % .
HOME SHOPPING NETWORK Inc. -LRB- St. Petersburg , Fla. -RRB- -- David F. Dyer was appointed chief operating officer , a new position at this home-shopping channel , effective immediately .
Mr. Dyer , 45 years old , had been vice chairman of merchandising and sales for catalog-retailer Lands ' End Inc. in Dodgeville , Wis. .
AQUILA GAS PIPELINE Corp. -LRB- San Antonio -RRB- -- Donald J. LaBauve , vice president for legal and regulatory affairs at this natural-gas concern , was appointed to the additional post of corporate secretary .
Mr. LaBauve , 47 years old , succeeds James R. Hatfield , who left the company .
Mr. Hatfield , 36 , also was vice president of investor relations , a position that remains vacant .
GRIST MILL Co. -LRB- Lakeville , Minn. -RRB- -- Harry E. Stephens III , 44 years old , formerly a principal with Northern Group , a closely held investment company based in Seattle , was named to the new position of executive vice president and chief operating officer of this maker of fruit snacks , granola bars and cereals .
UJB FINANCIAL Corp. , Princeton , N.J. , approved a 24 % increase in the quarterly dividend , to 26 cents from 21 cents , payable Nov. 1 to stock of record Oct. 6 .
The increase , the second in nine months , reflects continued earnings improvement , said T. Joseph Semrod , chairman of the bank holding company , which has $ 14.5 billion in assets .
GTE Corp. -LRB- Stamford , Conn. -RRB- -- Mary Beth Bardin , 39 years old , was named vice president-public affairs for GTE Telephone Operations , a post she has filled on an acting basis since April .
She succeeds Bruce Reddit , 43 , who was named vice president-public affairs and communications for the parent company .
MILAN -- The deck seems stacked against the tiny family-run enterprises of Emilia-Romagna , a traditionally communist Italian region .
The enterprises have n't known the advantages of a stable central government for a long time .
They have had to stomach sky-high taxes and exorbitant bank lending rates .
They have had to cope with extortion demands from organized-crime networks .
And , with little help from the Italian government , they have had to compete against much larger companies overseas .
Yet despite their seeming disadvantages , the enterprises of Emilia-Romagna are flourishing .
The reasons may hold implications for small businesses everywhere .
The companies hold their own in many global markets , even in high-technology fields .
Italy 's machine-tool industry , centered in Emilia-Romagna and dominated by small producers , ranks second in Europe and fourth in the world , for example .
Lately , the weak lira has further boosted the Emilian businesses .
And along with other small and medium-size exporters , the Emilian region is helping to lead Italy 's current economic recovery .
Several U.S. universities are studying the Emilian model of industry and industrial growth to see whether it can be transplanted to other points on the globe .
Experts say the explanation for the success of this model in Emilia-Romagna and similar regions in Italy lies in the highly interwoven nature of the enterprises there -- a characteristic somewhat shared by small businesses in Taiwan , Hong Kong and California 's Silicon Valley .
The Emilian region is divided into industrial districts , or autonomous local production systems .
Competitors and suppliers cluster together in small geographical areas .
For example , there 's the `` Food Valley '' around Parma , where much of the world 's prosciutto , parmesan cheese and spaghetti is made .
There 's a cluster of textile manufacturers at Carpi , near Modena , that specializes in knitwear .
Motorcycle makers congregate around Bologna .
Piacenza is a center for machine tools .
Even luxury-car makers band together : Ferrari , Maserati and Bugatti are all located in Modena .
The geographical proximity of companies and their suppliers reduces the need for warehouses and long waits for orders .
Having suppliers on the spot also enables manufacturers to respond quickly to fluctuating demand .
`` Our model allows for shorter time to market , '' says Gianni Lorenzoni , a business-planning professor at the University of Bologna .
Moreover , it allows for efficient sharing of information .
`` It has implications on cost structure , technical knowhow and economic flexibility .
On a different scale , the same model explains the performance of large Japanese companies , '' he adds .
It also helps that the region 's enterprises speak with a single voice -- through trade groups known as industrial associations .
The entrepreneurs find strength in numbers and a sense of belonging from these associations .
`` If these companies seem small , in reality they 're not , '' says Prof. Lorenzoni .
`` You 're not just one car .
You 're part of a convoy .
'' In Modena and Reggio Emilia , 200 tiny ceramic companies produce 80 % of Italy 's tiles -- which in turn account for nearly 27 % of world ceramic-tile production .
None of these enterprises would have wandered into China on their own to stake out new markets .
But Assopiastrelle , their powerful industry association , recently did so for them .
In such circumstances , 200 companies can act as one large one .
The Emilian system has been around so long that the region 's schools and universities supply graduates with just the right training needed by local industry .
Academics and business executives collaborate on research and development .
`` In our system , there 's a lot of innovation right in the field , '' says Stefano Micossi , head of research at Confindustria , an Italian umbrella industrial association in Rome .
Leading packaging machinery manufacturer G. DD SpA attributes its success to its Emilian flexibility .
The company was founded in the 1920s , says managing director Giancarlo De Martis .
`` After that , it was like chromosomes .
Technical workers with new ideas would leave and start their own companies , each specialized in a niche .
Now , for anything someone wants to package , we ` re flexible enough to supply the machinery .
'' Mr. De Martis says G. D , a family-owned business with annual sales of more than $ 500 million , has more than 50 suppliers that depend on it .
The medium-size company , located in the heart of Bologna 's `` Packaging Valley , '' exports more than 80 % of its output to more than 50 countries .
Experts say the Emilian model evolved spontaneously as a result of certain cultural and historical factors .
The region 's highly individualistic inhabitants find gratification in starting their own businesses .
Every worker 's dream is to be the boss , no matter on how small a scale .
Staying small also has helped companies cope with Italy 's high labor costs .
Small firms partly escape the effects of rigid social legislation that protects workers against layoffs and provides substantial benefits .
These laws primarily apply to large companies .
And in traditionally communist Emilia-Romagna , only small businesses could have avoided powerful trade unions .
But some believe success may create its own problems .
As Emilian small businesses grow bigger , their biggest challenge may be `` to maintain spontaneity , '' says Prof. Lorenzoni .
SAN JOSE , Calif. -- T.J. Rodgers is a well-known talker .
But his listening skills have helped turn Cypress Semiconductor Inc. around .
The cocky chief executive officer of Cypress got into trouble by ignoring warnings that some of his trademark business strategies were no longer working .
But by tuning in to the market and heeding his own board , Mr. Rodgers has drastically improved Cypress 's profitability .
Now he is back on the attack , charging into new businesses , buying smaller companies and boosting manufacturing capacity .
And Cypress , after a three-year sales plateau , stands a decent chance of graduating from the crowded ranks of midsize chip makers .
`` We are going to turn this into a $ 1 billion company , '' declares Pierre Lamond , the venture capitalist who serves as chairman of Cypress , which had sales last year of $ 304.5 million .
In the sixth quarter of its rebound , Cypress topped Wall Street 's second-quarter forecasts last month , with profit more than tripling to $ 11.6 million , or 29 cents a share , from $ 3.6 million , or 10 cents a share , a year earlier .
Revenue jumped 34 % to $ 100.2 million from $ 74.8 million .
Analysts expect Cypress to earn more than $ 47 million , or $ 1.17 a share , and to exceed $ 400 million in sales this year .
Last year , it earned $ 8 million , or 21 cents a share .
Hitting $ 100 million in quarterly sales was a milestone .
Cypress 's headquarters here , a relentless place to work even by Silicon Valley 's workaholic standards , closed at 3 p.m. PDT for a parking lot party with a reggae band .
The festive mood is linked to some sweeping changes in the markets for personal computers and the networks that connect them .
In particular , Cypress is in a strong position to supply speedy static random-access memory chips , or SRAMs , for a new generation of PCs .
SRAMs account for 50 % of Cypress ' sales , and new machines based on Intel Corp. 's Pentium microprocessor increasingly depend on more and faster SRAM chips to fetch data at maximum speed from temporary repositories known as caches .
`` That 's our ticket to the big leagues , '' the 46-year-old Mr. Rodgers says .
An expert in chip-making processes , Mr. Rodgers founded Cypress in 1982 and became a business-magazine cover boy for criticizing protectionist tendencies and bureaucratic bigness among chip makers .
Inside Cypress , he imposed tight spending controls and other tough policies .
`` Killer software '' on imposed penalties if rules were repeatedly broken -- one such system automatically stopped paychecks for vice presidents if they did n't complete performance reviews on time .
But Mr. Rodgers , who wrote a book on his management style , sometimes frustrated his deputies by micromanaging .
`` There would be times when T.J. would sign off on every purchase order , '' says Ken Goldman , who left Cypress as chief financial officer in 1992 .
`` He is one who needs to be in control .
'' Mr. Rodgers could n't control some big changes in Cypress 's markets .
For nearly 10 years , Cypress avoided brutal price competition in a series of small markets for fast memory chips .
When rivals finally invaded that turf , Cypress 's operating costs were too high .
Mr. Rodgers , after years of defending all-American manufacturing , was forced to cut costs by moving some operations to Thailand and slashing his work force 35 % .
Amid the restructuring , Cypress had a loss of $ 21 million in 1992 as revenue fell 5 % to $ 272.2 million .
Mr. Rodgers also was seduced by microprocessors , the chip industry 's glamour market .
But Cypress 's microprocessor unit , Ross Technology Inc. , was devastated when a key chip was passed over by Sun Microsystems Inc. , its only large customer .
Mr. Lamond says the board ordered Mr. Rodgers to end the money-losing venture ; Cypress sold Ross to Fujitsu Ltd. for $ 21.8 million last year .
`` We told him we have to put our house in order , '' Mr. Lamond says .
Ross symbolized one of Mr. Rodgers 's most cherished ideas -- that Cypress was best structured as a group of independent units with their own stock to motivate employees .
That structure , tried with three subsidiaries , wound up causing conflicts .
The units , for example , would push for unreasonably low prices when they bought chips from Cypress factories .
Mr. Rodgers also had personal clashes with Roger Ross , the microprocessor unit 's equally strong-willed president .
`` That company 's arrogance was not in line with their accomplishments , '' Mr. Rodgers says .
Mr. Ross retorts : `` I do n't know how to be successful in this business without being a little bit arrogant .
'' He adds that `` we had a pretty good guy to copy from , '' referring to Mr. Rodgers .
Cypress absorbed its other units , Aspen Semiconductor Corp. and Multichip Technology Inc. , and bought back their employees ' stock .
The company 's lower cost structure has allowed it to attack crowded , high-volume markets , as well as specialty niches .
Although the average selling price of a Cypress chip has dropped to $ 4.18 from around $ 7.50 , its pretax profit margins have risen to 18 % from 14.3 % at the end of last year .
Cypress 's strategy is to grab an increasing share of the chip content in PCs and new networking devices .
To step up the pace , Mr. Rodgers bought IC Designs Inc. , which makes timing chips used on most PCs ; Contaq Microsystems Inc. , a tiny company that makes PC chip sets ; and a line of fast logic chips from Performance Semiconductor Corp. .
Cypress also entered a hot market for `` programmable gate arrays , '' chips that let customers customize their own chips .
Mr. Rodgers has made other opportunistic moves .
He recruited Dan McCranie , a well-known Silicon Valley executive who had been CEO of Seeq Technology Inc. , to become vice president of marketing and sales .
On March 23 , Cypress closed a $ 110 million private placement of convertible subordinated debentures paying just 3.15 % interest the day before bond-market perturbations began jolting interest rates .
To stay on its growth track , analysts say , Cypress must reach volume production with more-advanced SRAMs this year .
`` Cypress is not really at the state of the art , '' contends rival Len Perham , CEO of Integrated Device Technology Inc. .
So Cypress needs to add more and better production capacity .
In an industry where new factories typically cost $ 250 million to $ 1 billion , Cypress is paying only $ 16.5 million for more space at its plant in Bloomington , Minn. , plus about $ 80 million for equipment to boost production there and at its plant near Austin , Texas .
The expansions will bring the company 's annual production capacity to $ 740 million of chips .
Mr. Rodgers , chastened by his 1992 experience , eschews talk of success .
`` I prefer to remember that if you get comforable with a recipe for success , it can turn into a recipe for failure , '' he says .
SAN JOSE , Calif. -- Digital Microwave Corp. announced a payment schedule for a previously announced $ 20 million settlement stemming from a class-action suit filed against the company in the spring of 1990 .
The communications-equipment maker said it paid the first $ 5 million quarterly installment yesterday , and will make subsequent $ 5 million payments in September , December and March .
WASHINGTON -- Suddenly , the Federal Election Commission no longer is acting quite so toothless .
-- Fined campaign committees associated with former Republican Rep. Jack Kemp 's 1988 presidential campaign a record $ 120,000 for numerous election-law violations .
-- Slapped Democratic Sen. John Glenn 's 1984 presidential campaign with $ 65,000 in civil penalties for failing to report properly the accumulating interest on bank loans .
-- Gotten the 1992 Bush-Quayle campaign to agree to pay a $ 10,000 fine for failure to report as a contribution a giant Clintonbashing banner that read : `` No Draft Dodger for President .
'' What is the FEC 's reward for all this ?
It may get its budget cut .
The newly aggressive watchdog is relearning an old Washington lesson : Do n't bite the hand that feeds you .
The commission is in the unique position of overseeing the very lawmakers who prescribe how big a budget it gets .
And of late , `` not everyone is happy about the commission 's actions , '' Rep. Charlie Rose , a North Carolina Democrat who is chairman of the House Administration Committee , said in a letter this month to FEC Chairman Trevor Potter .
One reason may be that the average fine levied against sitting members of Congress has swelled to more than $ 13,000 from less than $ 3,000 in 1992 .
As evidence of members ' unhappiness , the House has approved a measure that would slash the FEC 's fiscal 1995 budget by about $ 3.5 million from the level requested by the Clinton administration , forcing the agency to cut 35 staff positions from its roster of 320 .
The Senate , however , has approved the $ 27.1 million the administration asked for .
Conferees from the two chambers are set to meet shortly to work out the difference .
Whatever the outcome , `` there are constant pressures on the commissioners to view their constituency as those being regulated ... rather than the general public , '' complains Fred Wertheimer , the president of the citizens group Common Cause .
`` It 's an age-old problem .
'' Late last year , the FEC reorganized its work load , dropping scores of matters that it determined were insignificant or stale , and promising to focus its limited resources on the big cases .
When it has n't been able to negotiate penalties , the FEC has gone to court .
In April , the agency sued a political-action committee headed by House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia , accusing it of failing to disclose a mail solicitation aimed at defeating Democrats in the 1990 congressional elections .
Mr. Gingrich called the suit `` an outrageous power grab .
'' But nothing has irked members of Congress as much as the FEC 's effort to more tightly regulate how lawmakers use leftover campaign funds to pay for personal goodies , which in the past have ranged from cars to family vacations to evening gowns .
`` It appears that the FEC is still actively searching for more and more activities to regulate , while not adequately addressing the agenda currently on its plate , '' Rep. Robert Livingston , a Louisiana Republican who introduced the amendment reducing the FEC 's budget , complained earlier this year .
Both Common Cause and the Center for Responsive Politics , a nonpartisan group , worry that the FEC 's latest draft proposal to crack down on abuses in this area still is n't tough enough .
And , says Elizabeth Hedlund , director of the center 's FEC Watch project , `` given that kind of political pressure that the FEC is under '' on its budget , it may be difficult for the commissioners to `` maintain their resolve .
'' Even at its most aggressive , no one would confuse the FEC with a steamroller .
It still takes years for audits and enforcement actions to be completed .
And at FEC hearings , commissioners often appear to go out of their way not to offend lawmakers who could make trouble for them when they come up for reappointment to their $ 115,700-a-year jobs .
Still , the agency is also straining to keep up with an explosion in campaign finances .
In 1976 , campaign spending in federal elections was 48 times as large as the FEC 's budget ; by 1992 , it had grown to 95 times as great .
Yet the agency has fewer auditors today than it did in 1980 , according to FEC Watch .
`` It is frustrating to have Congress on the one hand criticizing us for not doing enough audits , and then on the other cutting our existing staff , '' says Chairman Potter , a Republican .
Created in 1975 in the wake of Watergate , the FEC was n't designed to be effective .
Yet Congress 's instinct has been to rein it in even more over the years .
In 1979 , Congress took away the FEC 's authority to perform random audits .
And in 1981 , the Senate even entertained the notion of wiping out the agency altogether .
Mindful of these events , the six FEC commissioners -- three from each party -- have in the past been reluctant to be assertive .
Much of the FEC 's new determination reflects the influence of Mr. Potter , who before joining the commission in 1992 practiced campaign-finance and ethics law at the firm Wiley , Rein & Fielding .
Unlike most of his colleagues on the FEC , the 38-year-old Mr. Potter has expressed no interest in serving another term .
He does n't mince words , either .
At a recent conference on campaign-finance reform , Mr. Potter questioned the way the system is tilted toward incumbents , pointing out that PAC contributions often look to the public `` like attempted bribery or a protection racket .
'' He said `` it is hard to imagine a clearer conflict '' than members of Congress setting the rules on campaign finance , `` which determine whether they keep or lose their jobs .
'' `` I do n't think I 've ever heard a commissioner be quite so bold , '' says Steve Stockmeyer , executive vice president of the National Association of Business Political Action Committees .

MERCHANTS NEW YORK BANCORP Inc. , New York , boosted its quarterly dividend 25 % , citing record earnings for the retail and commercial banking concern .
The dividend was increased to 50 cents a share from 40 cents a share , payable Sept. 26 to stock of record Sept. 16 .
The company 's chairman , Spencer B. Witty , said improved interest-rate spreads , lower loan-loss provisions and a slightly lower provision for taxes contributed to higher earnings .
TOKYO -- When he embarks on a weeklong swing through Southeast Asia next week , Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama will bear a message : Japan is increasingly paying attention to relations in its own backyard .
Japan 's Socialist premier , in his third international trip in two months in office , will visit the Philippines , Vietnam , Malaysia and Singapore before returning to Tokyo at the end of the month .
It 's by far the longest foreign foray yet for the 70-year-old premier , who previously attended the Group of Seven summit meeting in Italy and briefly visited South Korea last month .
The latest trip is intended to send a signal about Japan 's international role .
As the region 's economic superpower , Japan has growing stakes in most major countries in Asia .
Japanese trade , investment and aid are all rapidly rising .
The question Tokyo now faces is how best to promote those economic ties , and deepen political and security relations , without worrying Asian neighbors too much .
`` Asia is the most important region in the world for us , '' says a Japanese Foreign Ministry official .
`` Making that clear is one of the most important points '' of Mr. Murayama 's trip .
Mr. Murayama probably will be confronted by some issues he would prefer to avoid .
These include Japan 's behavior during World War II and questions of war-compensation claims .
In recent days , the Japanese press has carried articles suggesting Tokyo is considering a new billion-dollar , 10-year assistance program for Asia , partly aimed at putting the war-compensation issue behind it and placing relations on a `` future-oriented '' course .
The package , which would finance cultural and educational exchanges , has n't been confirmed , and would n't be aimed at compensating so-called `` comfort women , '' Asian women forced into prostitution by the Japanese military during the war .
The lingering sensitivity of such issues was underscored last Sunday , when a member of Mr. Murayama 's cabinet was forced to resign after suggesting Japan 's wartime occupation was actually good for some of its Asian neighbors .
Shin Sakurai was the second cabinet minister in three months to resign for comments playing down Japan 's wartime behavior .
The Japanese also hope to surf across some other potential big waves .
For instance , Japan is cautious about a proposal for an East Asian Economic Caucus , advocated by Malaysian Premier Mahathir Mohamad but criticized by Washington .
Before deciding its course , Japan said it wants the EAEC idea to have the blessing of all members of the 17-nation Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum , including the U.S. During the trip , there will also be a spotlight on Vietnam .
Mr. Murayama will be the first Japanese leader to visit Vietnam in nearly 30 years , and the first Japanese prime minister ever to make an official visit to Hanoi .
Japan is by far Vietnam 's largest aid donor .
Japanese private investment , however , lags behind outlays from Taiwan , Hong Kong and South Korea .
Mr. Murayama and his entourage will try to suggest ways Tokyo can help Vietnam lure private investment , by improving infrastructure and easing business laws and regulations .
Another signal of the growing focus on relations with Vietnam is the recent appointment of Japanese diplomat Kazuo Ogura as ambassador in Hanoi .
Mr. Ogura in the past has advocated a greater Japanese role in fostering pan-Asian cooperation in economic and security matters .
CINCINNATI -- Procter & Gamble Co. plans to form a joint venture in Vietnam , making it one of the first well-known U.S. consumer-products companies to invest there .
P&G said it signed a letter of intent to form a $ 14.3 million venture with Consumer & Industrial Chemicals Corp. of Vietnam to make shampoo , soap , toothpaste and detergent .
The U.S. company , which would have a 70 % stake , said initial terms of the venture include building a plant to produce personal-care products .
Its Vietnamese partner would own 30 % of the venture .
The plan requires clearance from the Vietnamese agency that regulates foreign investment .
ATLANTA -- Southern Co. said its Southern Electric International unit is in talks with government officials in Venezuela about purchasing an interest in a large state-owned electric power plant .
`` There 's no deal , it 's just talks , '' said a company spokesman .
Southern Electric International , he said , is considering bidding for all or part of the plant , called Planta Centro , which the government intends to privatize .
Southern Electric has invested recently in utility facilities in Argentina and Chile , among other countries .
Southern Co. is an electric utility holding company .
KEANE Inc. -LRB- Boston -RRB- -- Robert A. Shafto , chairman and chief executive officer of New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. , was elected a director of this software developer , expanding the board to four members .
Scandinavian Airlines System swung into the black for the first half , reporting a 619 million krona -LRB- $ 79 million -RRB- pretax profit , compared with a year-earlier loss of 609 million kronor .
SAS said results were buoyed by growing business traffic , more stable exchange rates and its own cost-cutting efforts .
With its report , SAS joins a growing number of publicly held European airlines enjoying a recovery .
British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines have both seen significant improvements in business .
State-run carriers , meanwhile , continue to bleed red ink .
Airlines such as Air France , Olympic Airways of Greece and TAP Air Portugal all have turned to their governments for aid .
Alitalia Chairman Renato Riverso forecast a 1994 loss even greater than the 343 billion lira -LRB- $ 216 million -RRB- loss posted last year .
And Iberia Air Lines of Spain needs more than $ 1 billion in fresh cash -- some of which may come from the government .
All of those airlines are controlled by their governments .
While SAS is 50 % - owned by the governments of Sweden , Norway and Denmark , those governments typically pursue a hands-off policy toward the airline .
In fact , managers at SAS are among the most vocal critics of regulation and state subsidies to the airline industry .
They are also among the most aggressive at cutting costs and restructuring .
SAS said restructuring costs led to a 274 million krona charge during the first half , and management said there will be `` considerable restructuring costs '' in the second half as well .
Nevertheless , the airline reiterated its forecast that 1994 will be a profitable year following a pretax loss of 492 million kronor in 1993 .
CADILLAC , Mich. -- Kysor Industrial Corp. said it will repurchase as many as one million shares of its common stock in the open market .

In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Kysor shares were up $ 1.25 , or 6.9 % , at $ 19.375 .
LONDON -- United Newspapers PLC of Britain announced plans to buy Visual Communications Group Ltd. , a picture library business .
United Newspaper 's Express Newspapers Ltd. subsidiary will pay # 27 million -LRB- $ 41.6 million -RRB- cash for VCG , which markets stock photographs through catalogs .
ADELAIDE , Australia -- Petaluma Ltd. , an Australian wine maker , said it plans to buy Mitchelton Wines of Victoria State for 19.4 million Australian dollars -LRB- US$ 14.4 million -RRB- .
Petaluma said it will partly finance the acquisition through the issuance of 1.8 million ordinary and 600,000 convertible shares at A$ 5 each to raise A$ 12 million .
The wine company said the acquisition will effectively double its size .
Petaluma also reported that operating profit rose 98 % to A$ 1.8 million in the fiscal year ended June 30 , from A$ 910,000 the previous year .
OTTAWA -- Canadian manufacturers reported further increases in their shipments and new orders in June , but their backlog of unfilled orders declined slightly , Statistics Canada , a government agency , said .
Shipments rose 1 % in June from May , the fourth consecutive monthly increase .
The gain was led by transportation equipment .
New orders were `` robust '' in June , rising 1.1 % , Statistics Canada said .
Unfilled orders , an indication of future shipments , fell 0.2 % , following a similar decline in May .
CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said an International Monetary Market membership sold yesterday for $ 850,000 , breaking a four-day-old record of $ 800,000 .
The price of an IMM seat , which entitles the owner to trade financial futures and options , including currencies , interest rates and stock-index instruments , has climbed 47 % so far this year .
Trading volume at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange through the end of July was 56 % higher than the same period last year , thanks in part to five interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve so far this year .
NEW YORK -- Loral Corp. won a $ 126 million four-year contract to develop a helicopter-crew training system for the British Ministry of Defense .
Loral said the system , which it will deliver in 1998 , includes cockpit simulators for the Royal Navy 's EH-101 Merlin Helicopter fleet , along with training devices and programs for the aircraft 's on-board and maintenance crews .
Future contract options could add $ 16 million to the pact 's value .
Loral said subcontractors include Data Sciences Ltd. and ECC Simulation of the United Kingdom , and CAE Electronics Ltd. of Montreal .
WELLESLEY , Mass. -- EG&G Inc. said it wo n't bid to renew a contract , for more than $ 600 million annually , to manage the U.S. Energy Department 's Rocky Flats , Colo. , facility .
EG&G cited changes in the department 's contracting rules that make the contract less attractive .
The decision , coupled with the recent loss of another department contract , may lead the company out of the Energy Department contract-management business after 1995 .
That move would `` conceivably '' cut annual revenue to about $ 1.5 billion , from $ 2.7 billion last year , said John Kucharski , chairman and chief executive .
Last year , net income was $ 59.1 million , or $ 1.05 a share , after a $ 20.5 million accounting adjustment .
Mr. Kucharski said that Energy Department contracting is less attractive to EG&G because the department has changed its bidding requirements in ways that force the company to invest more resources and management time and assume greater potential liabilities .
`` Would we like the DOE business ?
Of course .
But in allocating resources , commercial businesses hold far more promise , '' Mr. Kucharski said .
EG&G makes instruments , mechanical parts and optoelectronics and performs technical service contracting .
But almost half its revenue in recent years has come from managing government facilities , a low-profit business , but one that did n't require much investment .
Last month , the Energy Department announced new contracting rules that lessened the chances that incumbents would be automatically renewed .
This month , EG&G lost its bid for the $ 5 billion management contract at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory .
Mr. Kucharski said that EG&G gets $ 600 million to $ 700 million a year for work at Rocky Flats , where it is cleaning up environmental problems .
EG&G 's other big Energy Department contract is at the Nevada Test Site , where it runs nuclear-bomb testing facilities .
`` When the specifications come out '' on the Nevada contract , `` we 'll take a look , '' said Mr. Kucharski .
EG&G gets revenue of as much as $ 600 million a year there .
He noted that business is likely to diminish because of the end of the Cold War .
REDWOOD CITY , Calif. -- Next Computer Inc. said it has begun shipping its NextStep operating system for computer workstations made by Hewlett-Packard Co. under an alliance between the companies announced in May 1993 .
The program is priced at $ 795 for individual users and $ 2,995 for software developers .
Next was founded in 1985 by Steven Jobs , who earlier founded Apple Computer Inc. .
STAMFORD , Conn. -- General Signal Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Fairbanks Morse Pump Corp. for an undisclosed price .
Fairbanks Morse , Kansas City , Kan. , had 1993 sales of $ 65 million , and will boost annual sales at General Signal 's pump group to about $ 200 million .
General Signal , which had 1993 sales of $ 1.53 billion , makes equipment and instruments for the process-control , electrical and industrial-technology industries .
AKRON , Ohio -- Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. said it will invest $ 20.2 million to expand rubber-making capacity for its North American tire operations .
The company said it will build a facility to house a new rubber-mixing machine and related equipment at its plant in Napanee , Ontario .
The equipment will be operational in the third quarter of 1995 .
RANCHO CORDOVA , Calif. -- Foundation Health Corp. said its London-based subsidiary received approval to offer managed health-care coverage in the United Kingdom .
Foundation Health Unlimited got approval from the U.K. 's Department of Trade and Industry .
The company said the market in that country is estimated at more than seven million people .
SEOUL , South Korea -- The Securities Supervisory Board of South Korea warned securities industry companies that people who devise and disseminate what it called `` evil rumors '' about lawmakers , heads of companies or listed corporations will be punished .
In a letter to 32 securities houses , 29 investment consulting firms and eight investment trust firms , the securities watchdog agency strongly urged them to put a halt to such rumors .
`` The board decided to send the letter because there have been stacks of unfounded rumors about politicians and leaders of firms , '' said a board spokesman .
`` Such rumors have sometimes dealt a heavy blow to people or companies involved .
'' SEOUL , South Korea -- Goldstar Co. said it has expanded production of color-television receivers in its plant in Mexicali City , Mexico , to two million units a year from 800,000 .
The expansion , which cost $ 13 million , is aimed at increasing the company 's share in the North American market .
TETRA TECHNOLOGIES Inc. said its board approved a 5-for-4 stock split , payable Sept. 16 to shares of record Sept. 2 .
The Pasadena , Calif. , environmental engineering and consulting services concern said the split will boost its common shares outstanding to 8.5 million from 6.8 million .
`` Menage a trois '' and crime `` passionnel '' would be out of the question in the United Kingdom ; the negligee would make a liaison `` dangereuse '' a little more risque .
These were part of a melange of proposals put forward last month by Member of Parliament Anthony Steen , who caused a minor brouhaha in the House of Commons by calling for the expulsion of all French words from the English language .
Forget words like baguette or croissant ; they would be out .
No one could visit a cafe or brasserie .
There would be no aperitifs or hors d'oeuvres .
`` In fact , there would be no restaurants , '' said the Conservative Party member .
`` In short , everyone in the country would have to mind their language and pardon their French .
'' The French parliament provoked Mr. Steen 's attempted coup by enacting a law , proposed by French Culture Minister Jacques Toubon , that prohibits the use of foreign words -LRB- in effect , almost entirely English -RRB- in business , advertising , contracts and trademarks where there is a French equivalent .
The law carries stiff penalties , so Mr. Steen proposed that his ban be the responsibility of Britain 's notoriously fine-happy traffic wardens , an extra 1,000 of whom have just been deployed on London 's streets .
`` In addition to using their eyes and gazing at parking meters , they would be invited to keep their ears open in public places for any French word that might escape the lips of a passerby , '' he said , according to the Parliament 's official transcript .
The fine would be # 10 -LRB- $ 15.30 -RRB- per word .
Mr. Steen admitted his proposals were `` not to be taken too seriously '' and were `` principally to make a point .
'' Indeed , he announced them not as serious legislation but in a parliamentary procedure ; the bill was given brief notice by his fellow MPs and then soundly defeated .
All that was left was for Speaker of the House Miss Betty Boothroyd to find the `` mots justes '' to wrap it up .
`` The guillotine has fallen , '' she announced , using , as it happens , the proper parliamentary terminology for ending such proceedings .
Coincidentally , Mr. Toubon got his own comeuppance soon therafter when the French Constitutional Council -- the body that decides whether new legislation is valid -- struck down key provisions of the French language law .
`` C'est la vie .
'' WASHINGTON -- The House Democratic leadership , confronted with a restless rank and file and continued sniping in the Senate , is prepared to postpone debate on health-care reform until after the Labor Day holiday .
`` I 'd say it 's losing life , '' said former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of the once-ambitious reform agenda .
But neither the Chicago Democrat nor the party leadership is yet willing to walk away without a floor fight on the issue before the fall elections .
`` We 're committed to going forward , '' said Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri , who told the Democratic caucus yesterday that the start-up date may slip to Sept. 8 .
`` A lot of them would like this to go away , '' said Mr. Rostenkowski , `` but they do that at their own peril .
'' The persistent delays in the House 's schedule contrast with its more aggressive leadership role in the early stages of health-care reform this year .
A major factor has been the need to wait for spending estimates being prepared by the Congressional Budget Office .
But without a major shift of public opinion , nervous lawmakers appear to have little appetite to challenge powerful business and medical-industry interests allied against substantial reform .
The Senate Republican leadership has aligned itself with the same opposition , and the Clinton Administration 's hopes rest now on whether it can strike a compromise with a bipartisan bloc of 15 to 20 moderates led by Sen. John Chafee -LRB- R. , R.I. -RRB- .
Both Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- and Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas -- who is vying for the same votes -- met with the group yesterday .
However , it will take a major leap for either man to agree to all of the centrists ' demands .
Among the most-debatable provisions is one that would cap employer income-tax deductions for so called `` first dollar payment '' benefit plans that minimize a worker 's out-of-pocket costs .
This proposal is sure to infuriate labor and comes as the Senate voted unanimously last night to weaken the civil penalties in a Democratic reform plan by striking a provision allowing the Labor Department to fine employers as much as $ 10,000 per violation .
The amendment , sponsored by Sen. Don Nickles -LRB- R. , Okla. -RRB- , was only a preliminary skirmish in a larger fight over whether to require employers to offer their workers health plans that provide at least a standardized benefit package .
And the debate illustrates a fundamental divide in the direction of the reform movement .
For liberal advocates , the basic package represents a social contract of sorts that both promises families a minimum level of coverage and requires all the insured to subscribe and share in the cost .
For moderates and the health-care industry , this standardization is also attractive as a benchmark for competition that could yield savings by helping consumers make more educated choices among insurers and providers based on price .
The strongest opposition comes from conservatives , who see the same standardization as an unwarranted intrusion on individual rights .
These arguments have gained strength as lawmakers struggle with the cost of subsidies to help lower-income families buy insurance .
And there is an underlying tension between the twin goals of setting a minimum standard of health insurance while also stretching available dollars to extend coverage to as many families as possible .
The same conflict is seen in the debate over insurance-market reforms .
The goal for many reformers is to create a large enough community-rate pool to share the risks of employers and provide more security for individuals with high medical costs .
But this change must be balanced against the desire of many companies to opt out of such a system and self-insure .
Conservatives and allies of the insurance industry want to preserve the most flexibility by drawing the line as low as possible , letting the greatest number of companies continue their current practices .
By comparison , the Clinton administration argues for a higher cutoff to spread out the cost shifts inherent in virtually all the reform plans .
The problem is exacerbated further under proposals to privatize Medicaid and bring these beneficiaries into the same risk pool .
And in trying to do so much at once , all the plans can involve decisions that come back later to haunt the authors .
For example , the major plans before the Senate seek to expand coverage through often-costly subsidy schemes to help families buy insurance .
To help pay for these subsidies , privatizing Medicaid is an attractive option because of the savings credited by the Congressional Budget Office .
But if the end result is that premiums go up for the small-employer market , it could have an adverse effect on coverage and make it harder to bring working-class families into the system .
`` You can run but you ca n't hide from these costs , '' said CBO Director Robert Reischauer , who is to meet with the Senate moderates this morning .
And if funds dry up for the various subsidy schemes , it could hurt Medicaid beneficiaries , who now enjoy what amounts to a federal-state entitlement .
A second low-income population that could be at risk is the hundreds of thousands of legal aliens -- often elderly -- who now receive assistance under Medicaid or the Supplemental Security Income program .
As now drafted , a business-backed reform plan introduced in the House last week and now being considered by conservative senators would deny these benefits in many cases to help pay for health-care subsidies elsewhere .
The issue has provoked concern among some lawmakers such as Sen. Pete Domenici -LRB- R. , N.M. -RRB- , but Rep. Jim Cooper -LRB- D. , Tenn. -RRB- , a principal sponsor , expressed no regrets .
`` I have n't heard any complaints , '' said Mr. Cooper .
`` Tennesseans have a hard time understanding why we give any benefits to noncitizens .
'' SALT LAKE CITY -- Questar Corp. said a subsidiary agreed to pay $ 13.2 million to purchase oil and gas reserves and other assets in New Mexico .

BEN TRE , Vietnam -- The economic future of this poor country rests in the hands of people like Nguyen Thanh Phuong .
He 's a 33-year-old metalworker in this Mekong River town 's central market , where he and three grimy workers bend , bang and weld steel strips into window grills .
Mr. Phuong takes in about $ 40 a day , while paying his employees only $ 30 to $ 60 a month , `` according to skill .
'' `` More and more people are building houses or fixing their old ones , '' he says , and since Vietnam introduced free-market reforms a few years ago `` local people can pay higher prices .
'' Hanoi wants more of that sort of thinking as it nudges this overcrowded nation toward prosperity .
With 70 million people and limited resources , the country needs local entrepreneurs to create jobs and keep living standards above the poverty line .
Foreign investors are essential , but Vietnam wo n't find real success unless it also finds many more Mr. Phuongs willing to start labor-intensive businesses .
`` The country will have to develop on the basis of human resources rather than natural resources , '' warns a World Bank study .
Vietnam 's offshore oil fields lure developers but at best the country will become another Malaysia , not a Saudi Arabia .
The forests are being decimated and mineral deposits are limited .

Half the children under age six are malnourished , and malaria is on the rise .
Some see a Malthusian disaster taking shape .
Yet most analysts say Vietnam is off to a good start and may well become , given more local entrepreneurial growth , an Asian economic tiger like its neighbors .
So far , despite an 8 % growth rate , it 's more of a kitten .
`` You need to be a little bit cynical about all the foreign enthusiasm , '' cautions the Hong Kong-based manager of a Vietnam investment fund , who finds more companies ready to talk big than invest big .
There are signs of real progress .
Hanoi is even intensifying free-market reforms .
Inflation has been cut from 70 % in 1990 to only 5.2 % last year .
Yet Vietnam 's total yearly economic output is only $ 15 billion ; it remains an extremely poor nation .
Many of the problems start in Hanoi , where the no-longer-quite-so-Communist leaders do n't know what a free market means .
Their economics comes largely from Soviet texts , and until the current `` doi moi '' or `` renewal '' policy got under way , were effectively shut off from the capitalist world .
`` Our professors were educated as central planners , and market economics has n't yet replaced those ideas , '' says Do Duc Dinh of Hanoi 's Institute on World Economy , its leading think tank .
`` So they teach what they still have in their minds and this mixture is confusing .
'' Almost daily , new rules are announced to push the free market along , covering things such as bankruptcy and property rights .
Hanoi calls in scores of foreign lawyers and consultants to help draft investment laws .
It sends central bankers to the International Monetary Fund to learn how to run a commercial banking system , which is being reinvented .
KPMG Peat Marwick has a $ 1.6 million contract to help privatize stodgy state factories .
But midlevel bureaucrats often do n't know much about applying these laws , and the legal system is unreliable .
That 's why , says a banker , it 's important to make friends with the local police .
For a price , moonlighting cops will play tough guy and collect overdue bills or enforce contracts .
Meanwhile , some civil servants delay reforms they do n't like , especially in state companies and ministries that control them .
They 're afraid privatization might eliminate their jobs .
Local entrepreneurs , vital to Vietnam 's recovery , face a shortage of capital brought about by low savings rates and an underdeveloped banking system .
There 's also growing corruption .
Dau Ngoc Xuan , head of the important State Committee for Cooperation and Investment , complains about local-government `` fees .
'' One company had to pay 120 fees to get investment plans approved , 80 of them illegal .
`` This is really important , '' says Mr. Dinh , the economist .
`` If we ca n't combat corruption , then we ca n't direct the economy .
We do n't think we have to kill someone to make him an example , but we have to put more in jail .

`` The country certainly has fantastic potential , '' says a World Bank economist .
Capital is coming .
Foreign aid suppliers have pledged nearly $ 1.9 billion of infrastructure and technical assistance , including major power generation , transport and education projects .
In addition some private companies are taking the plunge .
General Electric Co. of the U.S. and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. of Australia plan an $ 810 million gas-fired power plant and fertilizer factory .
Many large Western and Japanese oil companies , and some from Russia , are finding petroleum and gas .
In addition , the Vietnamese diaspora remits $ 500 million a year to relatives and increasingly returns to sniff out business opportunties .
But foreign investors alone ca n't solve Vietnam 's employment problems , which grow as state firms shed workers and the army demobilizes more troops .
By midyear , one foreign banker estimates , all overseas investors combined had created only 10,000 new jobs .
That 's why the government plans more loans to former soldiers and bureaucrats ; it wants them launched firmly into the market system and off the state payroll for good .
Likewise , some private money is available .
For example , James Rockwell , a young American who founded Vatico , a consulting and investment firm in Hanoi , has a $ 1 million fund for financing small-time entrepreneurs .
A visit with Nguyen Van Than , a scarred rice farmer with one eye askew who lives in Nhi Quy hamlet of the delta 's Tien Giang province suggests the entreprenurial spirit may carry the day .
Years ago he worked for a U.S. contractor at Saigon 's Tan Son Nhut airport .
But that job ended when most Americans left in 1973 , so he came home to do what seemed logical , join his father and brother as a squad leader in the Vietcong .
But after the Communists won , they divided the rice paddy , and his politically correct family had to surrender some of their land to folks he clearly considers undeserving .
But the collective system collapsed in 1985 , following crop failures and food shortages , and the family plot was restored .
Mr. Than clearly prefers life in the free market system .

'' Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. said that in response to `` unwarranted criticism '' it will stop marketing its drug Parlodel as a lactation suppressant .
The drug maker said it is confident that the product is safe and effective .
But it expressed concern that criticism of Parlodel as a lactation suppressant could affect its greater use in treating disorders such as Parkinson 's disease .
`` Parlodel is widely used to treat Parkinson 's disease and endocrine disorders , '' said Timothy Rothwell , president and chief executive officer of the company , based in East Hanover , N.J. `` It would be unfortunate if the medical benefits that this product provides in those areas are overshadowed by attacks on Parlodel 's use in the postpartum indication that have no scientific foundation .
'' The drug will continue to be sold to treat Parkinson 's and other disorders .
The company estimates that 600,000 women a year have taken the drug following childbirth , after choosing not to breastfeed .
The drug chemically lowers levels of the hormone that makes milk-production possible , a process that happens naturally , anyway .
Parlodel 's use in drying up new mothers ' breast milk has been the subject of continual controversy .
The company has insisted that there is no evidence to support claims that postpartum use of the drug causes seizures , strokes and heart attacks , as critics have contended .
Doctors are divided about the risks and benefits of Parlodel for this use .
Five years ago , the Food and Drug Administration asked the company to voluntarily stop selling the drug as a lactation suppressant but the company refused .
`` The agency has been concerned about the use of the drug for this purpose for a number of years and was prepared to take action to remove this indication , '' said Jim O'Hara , a spokesman for the FDA .
`` This action by the company resolves that issue .
'' On Tuesday , Public Citizen Health Research Group filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia seeking to force the FDA to publish a notice of opportunity of a hearing on the drug in the Federal Register .
The consumer group contends that Parlodel is to blame for at least 19 deaths of women who used the drug to suppress lactation since 1989 .
Currently , Sandoz is facing at least seven lawsuits in the U.S. over the effects of Parlodel .
It has settled with seven other plaintiffs out of court ; one settlement was for $ 125,000 .
Lawyers for some of the plaintiffs whose cases are pending were uncertain about how Sandoz 's decision to remove the indication would affect its legal liability .
Subsequent remedial measures by a defendant frequently ca n't be entered as evidence , especially in negligence actions .
`` Whether it 's admissible , I do n't know , but they 're recognizing that it 's a problem , '' said Ellen Relkin , a New York lawyer whose firm represents two plaintiffs who have sued Sandoz .
A spokesman for Sandoz said the company is using a variety of channels to notify doctors of the indication withdrawal , including sending notices to medical groups by fax , and is prepared to answer inquiries from doctors .
Although doctors could continue prescribing Parlodel to new mothers who want their milk dried up , legal experts say that by doing so doctors would expose themselves to potential liability .

Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. said a subsidiary signed a contract with the government of Indonesia to develop mineral deposits in Irian Jaya , the country 's eastern most province .
The unit , PT Irja Eastern Minerals Corp. , will explore and develop copper , gold , silver and other mineral deposits in three tracts of land covering about 2.5 million acres .
The contract has a 30-year term , with two 10-year extensions permitted under certain conditions .
The tracts are adjacent to a 6.5 million acre site covered under a similar contract between Indonesia and another Freeport unit , P.T. Freeport Indonesia Co. .
Freeport , a Reno , Nev.-based cooper and gold producer , is a 70 % - owned affiliate of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. , of New Orleans .
President Clinton is attempting to sell his crime bill by noting how much each state will gain from its $ 9 billion in earmarked funds .
But consider : The money each state gets will come of course largely from its taxpayers .
But not all states will get back from this bill what they have given in federal taxes .
Some states are likely to be net losers .
Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute notes that California will get $ 900 million in earmarked funds from the crime bill or 10 % of the total earmarked funding .
But California typically accounts for 14 % of total federal tax payments .
But 14 % of the $ 9 billion would be $ 1.147 billion .
It will therefore pay $ 247 million more in taxes than it will get back in earmarked funds .
Meanwhile , some states will get a net benefit from the crime bill .
Arkansas is a $ 37 million winner .
The top 10 losing states , which proportionately will give more than they will receive , are listed below .
We ca n't help noticing that the losers are states with the most well-known crime problems : Democrats are trying to overturn the appointment of Kenneth Starr to replace Whitewater Special Counsel Robert Fiske and discredit David Sentelle , the chief federal appeals judge who appointed him .
Even more ominously , the Resolution Trust Corp. has put on administrative leave the three Kansas City RTC officials most closely involved with the criminal investigation of Whitewater .
Our view of the offensive against Messrs. Starr and Sentelle is that it is partisanship blinded to its own interests .
By all accounts , Mr. Starr 's professional demeanor and work is fair-minded almost to a fault .
We 'd think the Democrats would want to take their chances with Mr. Starr 's straight-arrow instincts rather than risk who might follow him .
Unless , of course , a fair-minded interpretation of the facts is what they fear most .
Which brings us to the suspicious RTC action .
Reports appeared Tuesday that Jean Lewis and two colleagues in the RTC 's Kansas City office had been placed on paid administrative leave .
Ms. Lewis is the investigator who led the Little Rock-based inquiries into the activities of Madison Guaranty S&L and the Whitewater land deals involving the Clintons .
After her office made criminal referrals on the matter to the Justice Department in September 1992 , Ms. Lewis later became embroiled in a dispute with Clinton-appointed Federal Attorney Paula Casey in Little Rock over the disposition of the referrals .
During the Whitewater Senate hearings , Arlen Specter suggested that Special Counsel Fiske was investigating a U.S. Attorney for obstruction of justice .
We discussed these matters Monday in an editorial , `` Who Is Paula Casey ?
'' The news reports of Ms. Lewis 's suspension from her duties appeared the next day .
Indeed , most of the Kansas City RTC 's Whitewater chain of command has been swept out .
Also put on administrative leave were Ms. Lewis 's supervisor , Richard Iorio , and their immediate superior , Lee Ausen .
RTC spokesman Stephen Katsanos would say only that an internal investigation was on regarding `` compliance with RTC policies and procedures .
'' This smells to high heaven .
Set aside whatever `` internal '' case the RTC thinks it may have against these three .
The action reeks of intimidation , an effort to muzzle a public official who 's actually spent time with the original Whitewater and Madison documents .
At the same time that Democrats are trying to destroy the credibility of a court-appointed independent counsel , a powerful federal agency is sending a signal across government that anyone who tells what he or she knows about Whitewater risks investigation and possible ruin .
The action taken by Jack Ryan 's RTC will have a chilling effect .
More broadly , this development points up one of our concerns about coping with the proliferation of official corruption globally , whether Whitewater , BCCI or party finance scandals in Japan , Italy and France .
The FBIs of the world are good at chasing normal crooks , but it 's difficult for law enforcement bureaucracies to carry out investigations of a nation 's high officials .
It 's just too hot to handle .
But we had better find a way to do it lest public cynicism also start to proliferate .
There was a time when the federal whistleblower law was supposed to protect officials such as Jean Lewis , but maybe someone ought to drop by the U.S. Office of the Special Counsel , which monitors that law , to see if Little Rock mores have arrived there , too .
Suspicions of a cover-up will persist , and rightly so , as long as a public airing of Jean Lewis 's case instead turns into a Star Chamber administrative leave .
At the moment , they are getting away with it .
In a major policy change , the Clinton administration plans to announce today that Cuban boat people intercepted on the high seas wo n't be permitted to come to the U.S. , but will be given the option of being sent to the U.S. naval facility in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The administration also plans to detain any Cuban boat people who slip by U.S. patrols .
For nearly three decades , virtually all Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro 's communist regime have been granted entrance to the U.S. The U.S. naval facility in Guantanamo is already crowded by thousands of Haitian boat people who have been denied entrance to the U.S. .
Some U.S. officials say that the presence of Cuban boat people in Guantanamo , a part of Cuba not controlled by Castro , would dissuade the Cuban leader from permitting large numbers of Cubans to head for the U.S. Further , many Cubans may decide not to make the effort knowing that they could be intercepted and brought to Guantanamo and not the U.S. Alarmed by reports that Cubans are massing by the hundreds on the island 's north coast to set sail for the U.S. , Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles yesterday declared an immigration emergency and asked the federal government to help the state cope with the swelling flood of Cuban boat and raft people .
The Clinton administration 's initial reaction to the influx of Cubans was low-key .
Washington 's only action had been Attorney General Janet Reno 's announcement yesterday that the administration would increase to 86 from 26 the number of Immigration and Naturalization Service agents being sped to Key West , Fla. , to deal with Cuban refugees .
Trying to avoid a sense of crisis , officials in Washington insisted the U.S. could easily absorb the number of Cubans expected in 1994 .
An official estimated that at current rates , a total of 20,000 Cubans could head here this year , but he added that the hurricane season is likely to hold the figure below that .
The U.S. has for years had a contingency plan , known as `` distant shore , '' periodically updated by the administration , for dealing with an unmanageable level of emigration , one official noted .
The plan involves such steps as moving boat people who arrive in Florida to other U.S. states and sealing off the coasts .
But `` we are well below the levels that would trigger this kind of thing , '' an official insisted .
`` It 's a controlled Mariel , '' says Agustin de Cardenas , a 46-year-old university physical education teacher who arrived at a Cuban processing center in Miami 10 days ago after spending three days on a raft with six fellow refugees .
`` Whoever wants to build his raft and go , well , he can go .
'' During the 1980 Mariel boatlift , more than 125,000 Cubans came to the U.S. , most on boats manned by their Cuban-American relatives .
A number of them were criminals and mental patients hastily freed from Cuban prisons and institutions and sometimes forced to emigrate .
So far this time , the people leaving Cuba appear to be a cross-section of the population , including professionals , workers and families -- from toddlers to 90-year-old grandmothers .
The new flow of refugees , though well below Mariel levels , has been growing since Fidel Castro , reacting last week to a riot and a spate of boat hijackings , said his government would no longer restrain Cubans wanting to leave the country , unless the U.S. negotiated an immigration agreement and an end to its three-decade-old trade embargo on Cuba .
A Foreign Ministry official reached by telephone in Havana confirmed that Mr. Castro 's orders that Cuban police and coast guard not do the work of the U.S. Coast Guard were being followed .
The number of Cubans picked up by the Coast Guard has climbed almost geometrically every day this week .
On Wednesday , the Coast Guard picked up 537 people , the largest number since the 1980 boatlift .
By 5 p.m. yesterday the number was 247 .
Nearly 7,000 Cubans have been picked up so far this year , about twice last year 's total .
Luis Alvarez , sunburned and sporting a donated T-shirt , waits patiently as throngs of refugees threaten to overwhelm the staff at the main refugee processing center on the edge of Miami 's Little Havana .
`` All of Cuba is going to come here , '' says Mr. Alvarez , a 48-year-old taxi driver , rescued by the Coast Guard several days ago after spending 18 hours on a raft with 10 other people .
Mr. de Cardenas , the physical education teacher , says everyone in Cuba wants to leave the island before the U.S. government decides to clamp down .
`` Before the Americans stop it , they want to get out , '' he says .
One of Mr. de Cardenas 's companions on the raft trip to the U.S. , Pastor Suarez , a 32-year-old truck driver , says the recent Havana riots have underscored Mr. Castro 's need to permit his disgruntled subjects to leave the island as a safety valve to Cuba 's disastrous economic situation .
Asking for Freedom `` The people ask for freedom , and since Castro ca n't give freedom , the only thing possible is to leave , '' says Mr. Suarez .
`` If they stop people from leaving , then there will be demonstrations against the goverment .
'' Mr. de Cardenas says the U.S. is very generous to Cubans , and permits them to come in , unlike Haitians .
It 's precisely that difference in treatment , stemming from the 28-year-old Cuban Adjustment Act , which allows Cubans who escape Cuba and arrive in the U.S. to stay , that has come under attack .
Groups such as the Congressional Black Caucus have complained about this double standard , and the griping could grow louder if Cuba mushrooms into a high-profile issue .
HOUSTON -- Malcolm I. Glazer , who owns about 32.8 % of Zapata Corp. stock , reinforced his control of the company by being named chief executive officer and president .
Mr. Glazer , a 65-year-old investor , last year launched a proxy fight for representation on Zapata 's board .
He eventually dropped the effort in exchange for two Zapata board seats .
Mr. Glazer was named chairman last month , succeeding , R.C. Lassiter , then-chairman and chief executive , who assumed those titles at Zapata Protein Inc. , the company 's fishing and marine-protein subsidiary .
Zapata is in the process of selling or spinning off its fish subsidiary to focus on its natural-gas operations .
A Zapata spokesman said Mr. Glazer 's new titles are consistent with the company 's strategy to separate its protein operations and concentrate on natural-gas services .
The spokesman said that the 1993 proxy fight `` is no longer a relevant issue with Zapata .
'' In other management shifts , Zapata named Kristian Siem , 45 , chief operating officer , a new position .
Mr. Siem , a Zapata director , had briefly served as chief executive and president until the board could officially elect a successor to Mr. Lassiter , the spokesman said .
The company also named Joseph L. von Rosenberg , 35 , vice president and general counsel .
Donald T. Locke , 36 , succeeds Mr. von Rosenberg as corporate secretary , and will continue in his current position as associate general counsel .
In addition , Zapata offered to buy back stock from holders of fewer than 100 shares for stock of record Aug. 15 through Oct. 3 .
The company said it will pay these holders $ 1 above the average of the prevailing market prices during the period .
LIBBEY Inc. -LRB- Toledo , Ohio -RRB- -- William A. Foley was named a director of this glass tableware manufacturer , increasing the board 's size to six .
Mr. Foley , 46 years old , is president , chief executive officer and director of Lesco Inc. , a Rocky River , Ohio , manufacturer of lawn-care products and equipment .
BONN -- Volkswagen AG posted its first quarterly profit in two years , thanks to an energetic restructuring program and improved European demand .
The German car maker said net income in the second quarter was 133 million marks -LRB- $ 85.7 million -RRB- , compared with a year-earlier loss of 355 million marks .
The turnaround marks a key step in the campaign by Europe 's largest car maker to break even for the year .
For the first half , VW still showed a loss , but it shrank to 209 million marks from a loss of 1.6 billion marks a year earlier .
Group sales rose 6.4 % to 40.9 billion marks in the first half from 38.4 billion marks a year earlier .
Unit sales rose 8.5 % to 1.6 million cars , VW reported .
VW 's core German operations , where restructuring efforts have been the most intense , moved into the black , posting a profit in the first half of 66 million marks , compared with a net loss of 946 million marks a year earlier .
In addition to the restructuring efforts , a better-than-expected recovery in the European car market helped VW .
Western European new-car registrations rose 6.6 % in the first half , according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association in Brussels .
Germany , Europe 's largest single market , has begun to stabilize as well .
New-car registrations in Germany rose 0.8 % in the first half .
Although VW 's sales in Germany slipped 3.5 % during the half , productivity improvements at the company 's German facilities helped the bottom line .
The German facilities can now post profits even when operating at only 79 % of capacity , compared with 1992 , when they would have had to run at more than 100 % of capacity to break even , VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech said .
By slashing VW 's capital investments , trimming personnel , conducting productivity workshops and pressuring suppliers to lower prices , VW has taken critical steps toward slimming down its sprawling operations , industry analysts say .
`` They 're not out of the woods yet '' but are far improved from a year ago , said Karl Ludvigsen of Ludvigsen Associates , a London-based auto consultant .
`` If they can strengthen the product side and continue making cost reductions , they could move strongly into the black .
'' So far this year , despite a 1.5 billion mark bailout package from VW , the `` earnings situation of our Spanish subsidiary remained poor and adversely affected the group 's half-year result , '' VW said .
The company did n't offer a breakdown of Seat 's losses in the first half .
But improvements from many other foreign markets , particularly China , South America and North America , offer grounds for optimism , VW indicated .
In the U.S. , VW more than doubled its sales to 56,570 cars in the first half .
Last year , quality problems at VW 's Mexican plant nearly choked off its U.S. sales .
First-half sales rose 33 % in Brazil , 48 % in Argentina and 14 % in China .
NEW YORK -- The dollar was dragged lower yesterday by escalating rhetoric on the U.S.-Japan trade front and data showing a worsening U.S. trade deficit with Japan .
The dollar began to slide in Asian trading after Yohei Kono , Japan 's foreign minister , said U.S. demands for quantitative targets to measure progress on opening the Japanese market were unacceptable .
And he warned that Japan will halt trade talks if the Clinton administration imposes sanctions on Japan .
Speaking on the same Japanese television program , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the U.S. wants concessions from Japan in order to solve the huge imbalance in U.S.-Japan trade .
Mr. Kantor 's office has said it will move to impose trade sanctions on Japan unless the Japanese government agrees to expand access to its government telecommunications and medical-equipment markets by Sept. 30 .
The dollar also was hurt by data released yesterday showing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan is widening again .
Though the overall U.S. trade balance narrowed to $ 9.37 billion in June from $ 9.52 billion in May , the June trade gap solely with Japan widened to $ 5.52 billion from $ 4.39 billion .
That was the highest level since March , when the gap was $ 5.8 billion .
Late in New York , the dollar was quoted at 1.5430 marks , down from 1.5525 marks late Wednesday in New York .
The U.S. currency also was changing hands at 98.57 yen , down sharply from 100.21 yen .
The dollar had n't traded that low against the yen since Aug. 1 , when it hit 98.35 yen .
Sterling was trading at $ 1.5492 , up from $ 1.5420 .
About noon Friday in Tokyo , the dollar was trading at 1.5438 marks and at 98.70 yen ; sterling was at $ 1.5480 .
Traders said the yen was stronger across the board , gaining ground against the mark despite the German currency 's relative strength against other European currencies yesterday .
Late in New York , the mark was trading at 63.88 yen , down significantly from 64.55 yen late Wednesday .
U.S.-Japanese trade tensions `` were already beginning to smolder , '' said Eric Nickerson , vice president and senior economist at Bank of America in San Francisco .
The war of words `` is like throwing gasoline on the fire .
'' The trade news was particularly damaging because `` there was some hope that the U.S.-Japan trade picture was improving , '' said Thomas Benfer , Bank of Montreal foreign-exchange director .
Mr. Benfer said the dollar is likely to continue to decline against the yen because the market believes the U.S. wants to use a stronger yen as a means of slashing the trade deficit .
`` The market does n't believe the Clinton administration when it says it wants to see a stronger dollar , '' Mr. Benfer said , `` especially when the trade numbers are this bad .
'' Traders said the dollar also was hurt by the Bundesbank 's decision to hold its key interest rates steady at yesterday 's meeting of its policy-making panel .
Expectations of a German rate cut had been heightened when the central bank announced -- around the time the Bundesbank panel began meeting -- that Germany 's broad M3 money-supply growth fell below 10 % in July .
July M3 grew at a 9.9 % rate , down from the 11.4 % growth in June .
But the mark gained when the Bundesbank left its discount and Lombard rates unchanged and announced that its closely watched securities repurchase , or repo , rate will be fixed at the current 4.85 % for the next two weeks .
The Bundesbank needs to cut the repo rate by only 0.10 percentage point to bring short-term German rates to parity with the equivalent U.S. Fed funds rate , which was boosted to 4.75 % on Tuesday .
Any reduction in the German interest-rate premium ought to help make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska -- Call it the battle of the polar pit stops .
For decades , Anchorage Airport was the favored stopover for planes flying across the Pacific and traveling over the pole between Europe and northern Asia .
Now , it 's feeling the heat from Russia , which is trying hard to rebuild its airports to appeal to both passenger and cargo traffic .
Until 1988 , foreign flights traveling between Europe and northern Asia had to fly north of the then-Soviet Union , which meant the planes had to stop in Anchorage for fuel .
Anchorage opened a big international terminal in 1981 and when transit passengers were n't posing for photos beside a stuffed polar bear they were spending like crazy at the duty-free shops .
`` Those were some great days at the airport , '' says Lowell Humphrey , airport director .
But when Russia opened its airspace in 1989 , the new route to Japan shaved three to four hours off flight times and eliminated the need for passenger planes to stop in Anchorage on their flights between Europe and Asia .
The airport lost about $ 17 million a year in duty-free concessions alone , not to speak of the landing fees from the 11 airlines that quit flying in .
From more than 1.5 million in 1988 , the number of international-transit passengers fell to about 316,000 last year .
The introduction of longer-range Boeing 747-400s and McDonnell Douglas MD11s also obviated the need for some trans-Pacific passenger flights to refuel in Anchorage .
To make up those revenue shortfalls , Anchorage Airport wooed airlines flying cargo between Europe and the U.S. and worked hard to keep its hold on cargo pit stops between Asia and the U.S. Cargo airlines do n't mind stopping frequently for fuel ; that way they can carry larger payloads .
The strategy worked : The airport has seen its cargo-aircraft landings jump 51 % since 1988 .
But that 's precisely the business the Russians have their eyes on .
Mr. Humphrey says he views the aspirations of Russian Far East airports as a very serious threat .
`` Geographically , they may be better off , '' he says .
`` And every day that goes by , they get some more understanding about how to operate airports .
'' Keen to earn hard currency , the Russians are opening airports that were previously off limits -- even to locals -- because of their proximity to secret nuclear-submarinepens , sensitive military bases and closed cities .
`` It seems the Russians have awakened to some capitalist interest , '' says C. W. Lund , manager of international operations for the Federal Aviation Administration in Anchorage .
`` They are selecting airports most likely to make money '' and working hard -- and with much U.S. assistance -- to get them to minimum international safety standards .
One stopover spot is the airport at Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk , on the island province of Sakhalin .
A Russian city near the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido , Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk is now open for international flights .
It 's well-located as a refueling stop for cargo planes lumbering between Hong Kong or Taiwan and the U.S. .
The Sakhalin airport also is smack-dab on the path of two new , internationally recognized air routes between the U.S. and Southeast Asia .
U.S. architecture firm Skidmore Owings & Merrill has drawn up an airport-expansion master plan for Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk .
Local authorities already are lengthening the runway to accommodate jumbo jets .
Another U.S. company has done a financial feasibility study for the airport 's expansion : As usual with Russia , the big questions are infrastructure and training -- and the money to pay for them .
Evgeny Krasnoyarov , the governor of Russia 's Sakhalin region , recently took a whirlwind tour of Alaska to drum up investment and trade links with his island province .
Acting as a spy of sorts , he sought to answer questions about such things as how the Anchorage Airport is funded , its parking fees for travelers ' cars , mail-sorting operations , and even its snow removal .
But the Sakhalin airport is only one of the growing band of Russian polar pit-stop wannabes .
Yuri Alaferovsky , director of the Novosibirsk airport in central Siberia , has said his airport is well-positioned to steal stopover traffic from Alaska .
Dave Carlstrom , marketing director of the Fairbanks Alaska Airport , agrees that Novosibirsk , along with the Siberia cities of Omsk and Irkutsk , `` have aspirations on transpolar traffic .
'' And besides Sakhalin , at least four other airports in Russia 's Far East `` want to capture cargo traffic '' moving between Southeast Asia and the U.S. , he says .
Khabarovsk in May 1993 opened an international passenger terminal with Japanese assistance .
Now an airport hotel is in the works and a second runway is being completed .
Petropavlovsk has a contract with a California company that markets and manages refueling stops there for international flights .
International-cargo carriers are starting to try out refueling stops in these Russian cities .
Fortunately for the Alaskan aviation industry , some of the Russian Far East pit stops are being tried in lieu of expensive , curfew-limited stops in South Korea and Japan .
Flights to the U.S. from Southeast Asia may still want to land in Anchorage or Fairbanks .
-LRB- Smaller Fairbanks , annoying Anchorage to no end , recently lured away the cargo-stopover business of Lufthansa , Air France and Cargolux .
-RRB- But as aircraft range and payloads improve , Russian fueling stops could take business from Alaskan airports .
The Russian airports `` do have some great strategic locations , '' says Brian Bell , a spokesman for Federal Express Corp. 's Anchorage sorting center .
`` We may take advantage of those airports in the future .
'' But for now , he says , `` their infrastructure needs a lot of work .
Their air-traffic control is n't the greatest .
'' Most Russian air-traffic controllers do n't speak English .
Russian aviation fuel is more costly than what 's on sale in Alaska and supplies can be dicey , according to the FAA .
The military still controls the airspace , so foreign pilots are n't allowed to deviate from designated routes .
U.S. engineers who have visited the Far East tell of Russian airport workers strapping foam cannisters onto missile launchers to meet the need for crash trucks that can spray flame-retarding foam on a burning plane .
The snow-removal equipment at the Petropavlovsk field consists of a jet engine tied onto a dump truck and turned on so its afterburn blows and melts the snow , they say .
Russ Wilson , chief pilot for U.S. charter World Airways , landed a DC-10 at Petropavlovsk last December to check out the Kamchatka fuel stop as an alternate to Seoul for the company 's Hong Kong-Los Angeles cargo charters .
He had to take a Russian navigator in the cockpit to talk to air-traffic controllers .
The runway was `` very rough , '' he says .
World Airways in the end reversed its plans to gas up at Petropavlovsk , but not because of those problems .
In fact , Mr. Wilson says , the landing fees there are lower , the location is better for a fuel stop and there are no night curfews .
The problem : The designated emergency-landing alternate airport is Magadan , which is so far from Petropavlovsk that World would have had to cut its payload and carry extra fuel .
Gov. Krasnoyarov insists that development plans for the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk airport do n't include stealing cargo airlines ' pit stops from the Alaskans .
But he is a pragmatist .
When told that Anchorage Airport is mulling what to do with its near-empty international terminal , he jokes : `` Close Russian airspace .
'' SAN JOSE , Calif. -- Wyse Technology Inc. announced a venture to bring advanced computer systems to China 's hospitals that could bring a surge in business to the closely held computer maker and its partners .
The company said a jointly owned venture with China 's Hospital Administration Institute will set technology standards for automating operations at as many as 200,000 Chinese hospitals .
Wyse will supply personal computers , terminals and multi-user server systems to the venture , which will sell them to hospitals .
Other partners include Intel Corp. , whose microchip technology will be used in Wyse systems , Sun Microsystems Inc. , which will supply operating software called Solaris , and Illustrata Information Technologies Inc. , a start-up company that will supply database software .
Aziz Valliani , Wyse 's executive vice president and chief operating officer , described the venture as a `` multibillion-dollar opportunity '' for the company over several years .
Wyse , which has Taiwanese investors , does n't disclose its sales .
The venture , called Beijing TrisunWyse Hospital System Integration Co. , is believed to be one of the largest information-technology projects in China .
The systems are expected to allow doctors in separate hospitals to routinely swap computerized X-rays and other medical images , in addition to text files .
They will use computers with multiple processors , massive storage systems , and socalled object-oriented database software that can store images .
`` This enables us to provide a solution which is going to touch one billion people , '' Mr. Valliani said .
WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department today will file a brief backing President Clinton 's claim of temporary immunity from the Paula Jones lawsuit .
The 25-page friend-of-the-court brief , to be filed in federal court in Little Rock , Ark. , closely tracks arguments of Mr. Clinton 's lawyer , Robert Bennett .
It maintains that a sitting president should n't be forced to defend himself against private claims based on his conduct before becoming president .
Only if the plaintiff 's interests can be protected in no other way , and only if the court determines that the suit wo n't seriously hinder the president 's performance of his official duties , should the action be allowed to proceed while the president is in office , the brief argues .
The Jones suit meets neither criterion , according to the government , and should be postponed until Mr. Clinton is out of office .
Ms. Jones filed suit last May alleging that Mr. Clinton made unwanted sexual advances toward her at a 1991 conference in a Little Rock hotel .
She was a state employee at the time ; he was the governor of Arkansas .
WASHINGTON -- Money market mutual fund assets increased a slight $ 20 million to $ 598.92 billion from a revised $ 598.90 billion in the week ended Wednesday , the Investment Company Institute said .
Assets of 672 retail money-market mutual funds rose by $ 1.11 billion to $ 426.31 billion , the trade group said .
Among retail funds , assets of 418 taxable money-market funds increased by $ 1.12 billion to $ 333.94 billion while assets of 254 retail tax-exempt funds slid $ 2.1 million to $ 92.37 billion .
Assets of the 284 institutional money-market funds fell $ 1.09 billion to $ 172.61 billion .
Among institutional funds , the assets of 229 taxable money-market fund assets decreased by $ 1.06 billion to $ 150.72 billion while assets of 55 tax-exempt funds fell $ 25.3 million to $ 21.89 billion .
OKLAHOMA CITY -- About 7:30 one morning , Labor Secretary Robert Reich called Masatoshi Ono , the chief executive of Bridgestone\/Firestone Inc. , to say he was about to charge a Bridgestone subsidiary here with safety violations .
Mr. Ono , with weak English and no translator on hand in his Nashville , Tenn. , office , did n't catch who was calling and missed some details .
`` I can not understand just what he was talking about , '' Mr. Ono says .
But he got the point : `` Somehow they want to make some example for their tough policy .
'' About an hour later , Mr. Reich did just that .
Flanked by local police and Secret Service escorts , the labor secretary marched past a phalanx of television cameras and into the Dayton Tire Co. plant here .
He hand-delivered a stack of papers alleging 107 safety violations and slapped a $ 7.5 million fine on Dayton Tire and its parent , Bridgestone\/Firestone , a unit of Tokyo-based Bridgestone Corp. .
Declaring the plant an `` imminent danger '' to workers , he dispatched lawyers to the federal courthouse here to get an emergency order forcing Dayton Tire to comply with safety rules or risk being held in contempt of court .
Mr. Reich 's dramatic moves were intended to show the Clinton administration 's determination to reinvigorate the government 's far-reaching regulatory apparatus after 12 years of Republican rule .
`` American workers are not going to be sacrificed at the altar of profits , '' Mr. Reich said at a news conference later .
He added : `` We can not have a competitive race to the bottom when it comes to the lives and limbs of American workers .
'' Instead , the visit ended up underscoring another reality of the Clinton era .
With public confidence in government at a historic low and concern about job security very high , efforts by officials such as Mr. Reich , even if well-intentioned , run into a barrage of skepticism .
`` There is growing disillusionment , '' says Deborah Bright , a New York consultant who has counseled a slew of major companies and their employees during the layoffs of recent years .
`` People are swirling around in this maze , uncertain about their own job security .
They 're paying higher taxes .
Then they see the government coming in with all these new regulations and fines .
Where is the logic ?
Where is the sense ?
They do n't see a benefit for themselves .
'' Indeed , just as Mr. Reich left Oklahoma City , the backlash began .
The Dayton Tire plant closed down for a day because , its executives said , they could n't comply with Mr. Reich 's orders .
The local newspaper attacked the secretary in an editorial headlined `` Reich 's Amerika '' and ran a cartoon of the diminutive official next to a giant tire captioned : `` Time to Retire ?
'' The Chamber of Commerce weighed in with an ad saying `` We Support Dayton Tire .
'' Dayton Tire President John Lampe , who flew back in a rush from a Minneapolis trade show the day Mr. Reich arrived , defends the company 's safety record and complains : `` Your own family starts looking at you funny .
Are you a demon ?
We ` re not .
We take safety seriously .
'' Mr. Reich focused on Dayton Tire 's safety record after a grisly accident last October .
Bob Julian , a 25-year veteran , was killed after a tire-making machine named `` Mary Six '' accidentally restarted while he was reaching inside it to service it ; his head was crushed .
Then , in January , Al Sauer , another worker at the plant , reached into a jammed machine to pull out a piece of stuck rubber .
The machine restarted , mangling his arm .
Mr. Reich thought Mr. Julian 's death , the allegedly low cost of remedies and the company 's apparent stubbornness about making amends would cause the plant 's 1,100 hourly workers and the public to applaud his action .
In the past , a government official taking on a big company over safety issues could hope for such support .
The reaction here `` amazes me , '' he acknowledges , adding : `` Unfortunately , some blue-collar workers today fear they have to choose between their job and a safe job .
'' The Dayton Tire workers did n't rally to the cause .
In fact , they proved more suspicious of Mr. Reich than of Dayton Tire .
`` He came here with his guns cocked and just did n't know what the hell he was doing , '' says Larry Pierce , sitting in his rusty pickup and drinking beer with coworkers at a gas station near the plant .
To Virginia Jolley , a Dayton Tire worker since 1982 , `` It was all political .
I felt he was trying to further the Clinton administration .
He was just so cocky .
'' And Alex Compton , a 10-year man at the company , calls the secretary `` an outsider '' seeking `` a showboat for power .
'' Dayton Tire workers seem more concerned about pay and benefits than about safety .
With the United Rubber Workers union on strike since mid-July after contract talks with Bridgestone\/Firestone failed , Mr. Compton sold his three-bedroom house , moved into an apartment , advertised a truck for sale and is scouting temporary jobs .
Yet he is cynical about government intervention : `` I do n't trust government anymore .
'' The crowning blow against the Labor Department was delivered the day after Mr. Reich 's visit by Federal District Judge Timothy Leonard , a Bush appointee and former Republican state senator .
The Oklahoma City judge dissolved the emergency order against Dayton Tire ; he did n't think the workers faced any imminent danger .
Later , he also denied the government 's request for a preliminary injunction against the company .
The charges are still pending before the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ; the case could drag on a year or more .
At his news conference , Mr. Reich played up the tragic death by having Mr. Julian 's widow , Phyllis , on hand , sitting silently by his side .
Dayton Tire `` absolutely refused to mend its ways , '' Mr. Reich said , calling the fine and court action `` the only way I know to get this company to turn around .
'' OSHA alleged that the company had failed to follow a `` lockout\/tagout '' procedure to ensure that machinery under repair does n't start up accidentally , and Mr. Reich said his department estimates that the changes it wants would incur a one-time cost of $ 6 per worker .
The company puts the cost of worker training and productivity losses much higher .
In the end , even Mrs. Julian was uncertain where her loyalties should lie .
Asked at home one evening whether she sided with the department , she says simply : `` I do n't have a side .
'' She is clearly devastated by her husband 's death ; she wo n't go near her front door at the hour when he would be arriving home .
But her son-in-law is a supervisor at the plant and her son got a job there after the accident , and she is moved by the company 's warning that it would shut the factory rather than comply with the department 's orders .
`` Bob would not want me to wish them to have to close down , to close their doors , '' Mrs. Julian says , fiddling with a dainty ruby ring her husband gave her on his 20th anniversary at the plant .
The soft-spoken Mrs. Julian , an elementary-school physical therapist , has become jaded .
Looking toward her husband 's empty reclining chair , she says slowly , `` Since I 've gone through this , I can see the world is a political arena .
'' She has wondered about Mr. Reich 's motives : `` I do n't know if the labor secretary did it for political reasons or because he 's sincere .
'' But she realizes she provided publicity points for Mr. Reich at his news conference : `` I know they thought it would look good for them to have me there .
'' Perhaps worse , Mrs. Julian believes that government red tape has aggravated her problems .
Workers ' compensation gave her only $ 10,000 plus $ 184.37 a week .
To pursue other claims , she says , `` I spent every day for three weeks trying to get hold of Social Security .
I was then told I could get a telephone interview in two weeks .
'' She eventually did get help .
She also had problems with the company retirement plan .
Even the labor-union officials who had complained about the plant 's safety problems are wary about the man from Washington .
The secretary 's visit showed `` that somebody gave a damn , '' James Casie , the president of the Rubber Workers ' local , says at first .
Mr. Reich was `` the first person who has shown interest in safety for years .
'' But , later in his office hallway , Mr. Casie questions whether the Reich visit will lead to improved safety procedures .
`` I do n't know that it did anything , '' he says .
OSHA inspectors first visited the plant a year ago to investigate a union complaint of repetitive-motion disorders .
But after Mr. Julian 's accident , they began studying lockout\/tagout procedures even though no union complaint had been filed .
The week of April 11 , Labor Department officials and regional representatives huddled in Washington to review the Dayton Tire files .
Safety inspector George McCown and OSHA 's Oklahoma director William White Jr. flew in from Oklahoma City to meet with headquarters officials .
The meetings ended on Wednesday , after Jim Stanley , deputy assistant secretary for OSHA , concluded that Dayton Tire should be slapped with citations because its allegedly weak lockout\/tagout procedures put workers in imminent danger .
Mr. Reich , eager to show the administration 's aggressive enforcement , made a last-minute decision on Friday afternoon to deliver the citation himself .
But ironically , he did n't even have the support of most of the safety inspectors who walked through the plant last year .
In depositions submitted to the court , three of the four inspectors admitted they did n't discern any imminent danger .
The fourth , Mr. McCown , reached the opposite conclusion only days before Mr. Reich 's visit , after going to Washington .
Joseph Dear , who heads OSHA , says Mr. Reich had information that the other three did n't about additional injuries at the plant .
Mr. Reich arrived in Oklahoma City late Sunday night and met with officials in a local hotel .
None of the safety inspectors attended .
`` In the government services , you learn not to question the secretary 's direction , '' Mr. White said later in court .
Labor Department officials called reporters early Monday to tell them Mr. Reich would issue `` safety citations '' at the plant .
Some reporters showed up thinking they were going to an awards ceremony .
Many local people say the government was heavy-handed in swooping into town and slapping a company with a huge fine .
`` Too much power , it sounds like to me , '' says Rick Chesser , a local farmer who grows wheat and alfalfa on Dayton Tire land .
`` It 's kind of frightening , is n't it ?
'' Down the road at Western Heights High School , Joe Carter , the girls ' basketball coach , says : `` We do n't think much of these decisions from a person in Washington .
'' Mr. Carter , who has a brother-in-law who works at Dayton Tire , has stopped buying shoes for school athletes to cut costs .
`` We 've had belt-tightening in all areas .
You always have that fear of losing your job , '' he says .
`` Here 's the bigwig making his political statement without thinking about how it affects real people .
'' FRANKFURT -- Germany 's central bank left its key official interest rates unchanged yesterday , signaling that it is n't in any hurry to ease German monetary policy any further , economists said .
The Bundesbank now probably will want to wait until after the mid-October federal elections before taking its next step , the economists added .
Most Bundesbank watchers canvassed , however , appear to adhere to the view that the Bundesbank still has one final discount-rate reduction up its sleeve .
Those who forecast that the Bundesbank has come to the end of its rate-reduction cycle still appear to remain in the minority .
Germany 's discount rate , the floor for the German interbank money market , was left unchanged at 4.5 % .
The Lombard rate , an emergency borrowing facility that acts as a ceiling for overnight rates , was left at 6 % .
Cornered in a radio studio last Sunday , White House ally Ron Pollack of Families USA was asked by a nosy columnist why a version of ClintonCare might still pass .
His candid answer : Republican Sens. John Chafee , Dave Durenberger and Jack Danforth .
The health care endgame has come to this : Unable to bludgeon enough Democrats , lame-duck Majority Leader George Mitchell bounces around the U.S. Senate like Muhammad Ali trying to lure a few GOP `` moderates '' into a bout of rope-a-dope .
These Republican sparring partners could learn a few things from a Democrat who really is a moderate , Oklahoma Sen. David Boren .
He understands that some moderates are more moderate than others .
Like the three GOP senators , Mr. Boren has been part of the `` mainstream '' Senate health care caucus , also dubbed the `` rump group .
'' But he now worries it has become more rump than group .
After one unhelpful session last week , the Oklahoman walked to the Senate floor to urge that `` we stop this -LRB- health care -RRB- train right now and get off .
'' Mr. Boren is a rare Beltway potentate who thinks the meaning of moderate is related to modesty .
In particular , modesty about the ability of government , and even of senators in their all-seeing wisdom , to redesign one-seventh of the U.S. economy from a backroom in a few frantic weeks .
`` That 's why the American people are so anxious '' about health reform , Mr. Boren says in an interview .
`` They see the spectacle of Congress rushing to pass a bill for the sake of passing a bill -- and one that could be so sweeping it could leave costs out of control and have all sorts of unintended consequences .
'' The Oklahoman was a Rhodes Scholar like many Clintonians .
But unlike them , he learned a lesson in Britain about the peril of narrow political majorities deciding large social questions .
He mentions British Steel , which Labor nationalized , then the Tories privatized , then Labor ... and so on .
Sustainable reform requires a social consensus reflected in large majorities .
`` I 've been worried that the mainstream group would fall into the trap of proposing amendments to the Mitchell bill just to get a few Republicans and moderate Democrats to reach 51 votes , '' Mr. Boren says , breaking the code of Mr. Mitchell 's rope-a-senator strategy .
`` The group will be pulled inextricably leftward , and the Mitchell bill is flawed beyond repair .
'' So Mr. Boren has jumped from the rump group and endorsed a much simpler bipartisan insurance reform -LRB- known as Rowland-Bilirakis -RRB- first developed in the House .
`` My choice is to do these measured steps this year , '' says Mr. Boren .
`` But if we ca n't do that , my next choice is nothing .
'' Somehow this wisdom is lost on the three GOP amigos , especially Rhode Island 's Mr. Chafee -LRB- Chevy Chase in the movie -RRB- .
As Hillary Rodham Clinton 's favorite Republican , Mr. Chafee was supposed to deliver several of his colleagues .
But as the public mood changed , and senators educated themselves , Mr. Chafee has been left nearly naked in the Republican square .
He now stands to the left of many Democrats .
His insistence on passing his own grand plan makes him look immoderate , even willful -- a Republican Ira Magaziner .
To his credit , Mr. Chafee has resisted Mrs. Clinton on some matters of principle .
But he shares her conceit that a few wisemen can make decisions for tens of millions of Americans .
Mr. Chafee insists , for example , on passing a `` standard benefits package '' of insurance for every American , which would blunt individual choice .
And he holds the quaint belief that a National Health Commission to determine benefits will somehow be above politics .
Maybe he missed that the Senate this week made its very first health `` reform '' vote an expansion of benefits .
Even yesterday 's budget warning from the Congressional Budget Office did n't faze him .
Mr. Chafee also seems naive about Mr. Mitchell , whose main goal is to get any bill to a House-Senate conference .
There House liberals , who would use Senate momentum to pass their own Clinton-type plan , would dominate , as they did on the crime bill .
Genuine moderates would then confront a final , much more radical , bill in October , just before the election .
Mr. Chafee already fell for a similar rope-a-dope in helping get a `` moderate '' health bill through the Senate Finance Committee .
This kept the process moving , as desired by Mr. Mitchell , who then re-made the bill Clinton-like .
That 's why smart moderates , led by Mr. Boren and a revitalized Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , want to kill any form of Mitchell now .
Then President Clinton and the liberals will have to choose moderate insurance reform that Americans would support , or start over next year .
Mr. Boren , only 53 years old , is retiring this year to lead the University of Oklahoma .
Mr. Chafee , though 71 , is running for a fourth term .
The health care endgame shows that the country would be better off if the two reversed their plans .
Management books and courses deal almost entirely with the publicly owned and professionally managed company .
Yet the majority of businesses everywhere -- including the U.S. -- are owned and run by family members .
They even include some of the world 's largest companies .
-- Family members working in the business must be at least as able and hard-working as any unrelated employee .
In a family-managed company , relatives are always `` top management , '' whatever their official job or title .
On Saturday evenings they sit at the boss 's dinner table and call him `` Dad '' or `` Uncle .
'' Mediocre or lazy family members are therefore -- rightly -- resented by non-family co-workers , and respect for top management and the business as a whole rapidly erodes .
Capable non-family people will simply not stay , and the ones who do soon become courtiers and toadies .
It is much cheaper to pay a lazy nephew not to come to work than to keep him on the payroll .
DuPont , controlled and managed by family members from its founding in 1802 until professional management took over in the mid-1970s , grew into the world 's largest chemical company .
It prospered as a family business because it faced up to this problem .
All male duPonts were entitled to an entry-level job in the company , but five or six years later their performance was carefully reviewed by four or five family seniors .
If this review concluded that the young family member was not likely to be top management material 10 years later , he was eased out .
-- Family-managed businesses , except perhaps for the very smallest ones , increasingly need to staff key positions with non-family professionals .
The demands for knowledge and expertise -- whether in manufacturing , marketing , finance , research , or human resource management -- have become far too great to be satisfied by family members alone , no matter how competent they may be .
Once hired , these non-family professionals have to have `` full citizenship '' in the firm .
Otherwise they simply will not stay .
The first people , perhaps , to realize this were the Rothschilds , who -- two centuries after a coin dealer began to send out his sons to establish banks in Europe 's capitals -- are still among the world 's premier private bankers .
Until World War II , they admitted only family members to partnerships in any of their banks .
But during the 19th and early 20th centuries , whenever a non-family general manager reached age 45 , he was given a huge severance payment and set up in his own banking firm .
The duPonts , around 1920 , found an even better method .
While not appointed to top management jobs , non-family members in key positions were given `` phantom stock '' -- participation in profits and capital gains without diluting family ownership and control , a still popular solution .
-- No matter how many family members are in the company 's management , and how effective they are , one top job must be filled by a non-relative .
Typically , this is either the financial executive or the head of research -- the two positions in which technical qualifications are most important .
But I also know successful companies in which this outsider heads marketing or personnel .
And while the CEO of Levi Strauss is a family member and a descendant of the founder of this 144-year-old company , the president and chief operating officer is a non-family professional .
Such an outsider can be objective and does not have to worry about the reactions of relatives , whether in the business or not .
I met my first `` outsider-insider '' almost 60 years ago , the chief financial officer of a very large family-managed business in Britain .
Though he was on the closest terms of friendship with his family-member colleagues , he never attended a family party or family wedding .
He did not even play golf where the family played .
`` The only family affairs I attend , '' he once said to me , `` are funerals .
But I chair the monthly top-management meeting .
'' -- Before the situation becomes acute , the issue of management succession should be entrusted to someone neither part of the family nor part of the business .
Even the family-managed business that observes the first three rules tends to get into trouble -- and often breaks up -- over management succession .
It is then that what the business needs and what family members want collide head on .
Typical are the two brothers who built a successful manufacturing business , working together for 25 years .
Now reaching retirement age , each pushes his own son to head the company .
The brothers become adversaries and eventually decide to sell out .
Or take the case of the widow of one of the founders of a company .
To save her daughter 's marriage , she pushes her moderately endowed son-in-law as the next CEO and successor to her aging brother-in-law .
Anyone who has worked with family-managed companies could add to this list .
There is only one solution : Entrust the settlement of the succession issue to an outsider .
This role was played successfully by a CPA who was the outside auditor of a medium-sized food retailer since its founding 20 years earlier .
A professor who for 10 years had been scientific adviser to a fair-sized high-tech company saved both it and its parent corporation by persuading two brothers and two cousins -- and the wives of all four -- to accept the ablest member of the next generation as the future CEO .
But it is usually much too late to bring in the outsider when the succession problem becomes acute .
Family members have taken positions and have committed themselves to this or that candidate .
Moreover , succession planning needs to be integrated with financial and tax planning .
Family-managed businesses , therefore , should try to find the right outside arbitrator long before the decision itself has to be made .
Sixth - or seventh-generation family businesses like Levi Strauss and the Rothschild banks are quite rare .
The biggest family-managed business today , Italy 's Fiat , is run by the third-generation of Agnellis , now in their 60s and 70s .
Few people in the company , I am told , expect it to be family managed 20 years hence .
The fourth generation of a family owning a successful business is sufficiently well off , as a rule , for the ablest members to want to pursue their own interests and careers rather than dedicate themselves to the business .
Also , by that time there are usually so many family members that ownership has become splintered .
For the members of the fourth generation , their share in the company is no longer `` ownership '' ; it has become an `` investment .
'' They will want to diversify rather than to keep all their financial eggs in the family-company basket , and thus want the company to be sold or to go public .
By contrast , maintaining the family company is usually the best course for the second or even third generation .
Often it is the only course , as the business is not big enough to be sold or to go public .
And it surely also is in the public interest .
The economy needs entrepreneurship .
The growth dynamics in the economy are shifting fast from the giant company toward the medium-sized one -- and that tends to be such an owner-controlled and owner-managed company .
Unfortunately , the family-managed business that survives the founder -- let alone one that still prospers under the third generation of family management -- is still the exception .
Far too few of these businesses accept the one basic precept that underlies all four of the rules outlined here : Both the business and the family will survive and do well only if the family serves the business .
Neither will do well if the business is run to serve the family .

WASHINGTON -- The House approved a bill to create a unique new entity , the Presidio Trust , to perform a myriad of financial tasks as the Presidio Army base in San Francisco converts to an urban national park .
The Presidio has been a military facility since 1776 , when it was a Spanish outpost , and a U.S. Army base since 1846 .
It is scheduled to shift to the National Park Service Oct. 1 .
Supporters of the bill , which the House passed by a vote of 245-168 , called the Presidio `` a national treasure .
'' Opponents complained about the plan 's cost , which some estimate could total more than $ 1 billion over the next 15 years .
The trust would be created as a nonprofit public-benefit government corporation within the Interior Department to handle the rehabilitation , improvement , maintenance , promotion and leasing of Presidio properties .
It would be run by a 13-member board and be authorized to make loans to occupants of properties it manages .
The bill passed by the House is much slimmed-down from the version approved some weeks ago by the House Natural Resources Committee .
The bill now goes to the Senate .
Thailand 's former police director-general , Sawat Amornwiwat , surrendered for questioning in the theft of Saudi Arabian jewels but denied wrongdoing .
The case began in 1989 , when a Thai worker stole gems valued at $ 20 million from a Saudi prince 's palace .
Thai police arrested the worker but returned to the Saudis only a third of the stolen goods , and many of those proved to be fakes .
Interior Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh accused Mr. Sawat , the former police chief , of helping shield a gem trader from charges of possessing the stolen jewels .
Mr. Chavalit alleged involvement by seven other top police officials , who have n't been charged ; 22 civilians also have been named as suspects .
Thai-Saudi relations were already damaged by unsolved murders of Saudi diplomats and nationals .
The gem case prompted accusations about police interference with the inquiry and the government 's resolve to prosecute powerful police officials and solve the byzantine matter , in which a key witness 's wife and son were found dead this month .
Japan 's hope to enter the commercial-satellite business was dealt a setback , when a launch of its domestically developed H-2 rocket was aborted seconds before liftoff because of engine problems .
The launch , already delayed a day by a bad fuel valve , could be rescheduled for next week .
The rocket is to put into orbit a $ 145 million government telecommunications satellite in Japan 's bid to compete with the dominant Arianespace of Europe , as well as China , Russia and the U.S. Japan 's space program has been plagued by delays and cost overruns .
Taiwan gave five state-run banks permission to deal with Chinese banks through overseas branches in other countries .
This marks the first direct contacts allowed between financial institutions of the two adversaries since Taiwan imposed a ban in 1949 , when the Nationalists fled the mainland .
The banks will be limited mostly to foreign-exchange transfers and letter-of-credit transactions , intended to support growing but still indirect bilateral trade and investment ties .
Belarus tomorrow will eliminate one zero from all sums in consumer prices , bank deposits and wages to align them with its zaichik currency .
When a ruble currency was introduced for use alongside the Russian ruble in May 1992 , cash ran short , so the zaichik was brought back into use , at a 1-to-10 exchange rate .
This summer , a proposal to merge with the Russian monetary system collapsed , as Belarus deemed this premature until it reforms its economy .
The U.S. dollar yesterday was valued at 32,800 zaichiki .
Land prices in Japan fell sharply for the second year in a row , the national tax agency said .
Prices this year dropped 17 % from a year earlier , following last year 's 18 % drop .
The average price for a square meter of land still remained high at $ 2,555 , but it 's down from $ 3,065 a year ago .
The agency 's annual survey found the biggest declines were in metropolitan Tokyo , where prices fell 21 % to an average of $ 5,520 a square meter .
Taiwan 's government is preparing legislation to allow foreigners to invest indirectly in restricted industries , such as real estate , agriculture and transportation .

Taiwan is opening its markets to foreign participation as it seek to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
In line with that effort , Taiwan also said it would allow imports of cigarettes and alcoholic beverages from GATT member countries , starting Sept. 1 .
The president of MMM , Sergei Mavrodi , ordered the Russian investment firm 's sales offices to reopen .
MMM shares were wildly popular until prices collapsed amid panic selling and accusations that the firm used new buyers ' money to pay exorbitant returns to earlier investors .
MMM quoted its own shares , and had interrupted operations briefly in late July as thousands of shareholders tried to sell their stock when the alleged pyramid scheme unraveled .
The sales outlets were closed Aug. 4 .
Before prices crashed , MMM shares had surged to 125,000 rubles -LRB- $ 58 -RRB- from about 1,000 rubles in February .
Mr. Mavrodi is in jail , charged with tax evasion and obstructing an investigation .
Starting Monday , he said , MMM is to resume selling shares , along with tickets that give investors a claim in an unregistered future issue of stock .
A special MMM panel also is to resume reviewing appeals by elderly , disabled and poor shareholders to recoup their investments .
MMM claims that two million Russians own its shares , and five million invested privatization vouchers in a separate fund .

GUNTERSVILLE , Ala. -- The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a federal lawsuit alleging that a Comptronix Corp. director tipped off an investor that the company 's management had improperly inflated reported earnings in 1992 .
According to the lawsuit , filed in U.S. District Court in Birmingham , Richard F. Adler , a Comptronix director , told business associate Harvey L. Pegram about the company 's problems before the problems were announced to the public .
Two other individuals , Philip L. Choy and Domer L. Ishler , also received tips , the SEC alleges .
In light of a subsequent drop in Comptronix stock , Mr. Pegram avoided losses of about $ 2.3 million , the SEC claims .
Mr. Choy avoided a loss of $ 75,000 , the SEC alleges , and Mr. Ishler made a profit of $ 268,000 .
E. Townes Duncan , chairman and chief executive officer of Comptronix , a maker of electronic parts , said he had n't seen the suit .
Mr. Ishler , reached at his home , acknowledged making a Comptronix stock transaction but said he never received the proceeds .
The other individuals named in the suit could n't be reached for comment .
The suit seeks , among other things , injunctions and disgorgement of allegedly wrongful gains .
In March , three former Comptronix executives settled with the SEC in a lawsuit in connection with the overstated earnings .
ATLANTA -- Teenagers ' smoking habits continue to be linked to brands that promote themselves most aggressively , according to a federal study .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , updating a 1992 report , found that among smokers aged 12 to 18 , the majority prefer three brands : Marlboro , Newport and Camel .
Those brands , federal health officials said , were the most heavily advertised in the U.S. in 1993 .
By contrast , preferences among all smokers were n't as concentrated .
Cigarette manufacturers have long said the influence of friends and family -- and not advertising -- plays the biggest role in a person 's decision to begin smoking .
But studies like those by the CDC , physicians and health officials said , indicate some marketing efforts are highly successful in winning and retaining adolescent loyalties .
The CDC 's survey of 1,031 teenagers found that 86 % regularly bought either Marlboros , Camels or Newports .
By contrast , those brands accounted for 35 % of the purchases among all smokers .
The tight grouping , according to the report , which contains the three most heavily promoted cigarettes in the country , suggests `` that cigarette advertising influences adolescents ' brand preferences .
'' Before Woodstock '94 recedes from memory , perhaps it would be a good idea to pause and consider what connections may exist between the original and its recent echo .
Partly as a function of anniversary-mongering , the first Woodstock festival is now wrapped in nostalgia and prestige .
Meaning of course that its adherents can now exploit it .
One of the weekend 's most hapless sights was of earnest , smiling , `` nonprofit '' PBS fundraisers using the film of the 1969 festival to shill for their version of culture .
They presented the film as the sacred record of a sacred event .
And then they put forward Woodstock veteran Richie Havens to say a few words about the holy day -- and then to plead for money .
We 'd just as soon have been left alone with the memory of Richie Havens ' original performance .
But PBS was merely surfing for dollars on the same wave of self-congratulation that had been rolling along and gaining strength for weeks , swollen by a thousand think pieces puzzling out the generation that `` came of age '' at Woodstock .
A letter-writer to the New York Times expressed the general tone of the self-canonization .
The 1969 festival , he claimed , helped to `` bring us back from the Vietnam disaster .
'' The rain , he wrote , `` was an unmerciful punishment by the cosmos to test our strength , but we were Americans .
Our forefathers had endured frozen Valley Forge .
'' This is of a piece with the attitude carried forward into adulthood by much of the Woodstock generation , which is to say a remarkable belief that its members were better , smarter , more sophisticated and of course more `` committed '' than all who 'd gone before .
Some -LRB- maybe most -RRB- who enjoyed the original Woodstock may have thought it was only rock 'n' roll , driven to astounding heights by blues guitarist Alvin Lee 's breakneck stampede through `` I 'm Goin ' Home .
'' But their betters hijacked the music and fun and put them to work in the service of a politicized social movement .
We now have the succeeding 25 years to consider that non-musical cause , and it appears the judgment of history may be mixed .
Among the many accomplishments of the Woodstock propagandists was the elevation of hedonism to a kind of moral imperative .
We were supposed to believe that its dirt and disorder , its drugged-out haze and `` daring '' carnality was a long-overdue flouting of the values of order , discipline and mind by which parents had managed to make a middle-class life for themselves and their ungrateful children .
The countercultural offensive rolled over parents too tired or too baffled to risk the further estrangement of their children by insisting on the respect they deserved .
But let 's get down to specifics : Clearly the legacy driven forward helped to unleash a drug and booze culture that has claimed millions of victims -LRB- Woodstock alums Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin were merely the best known -RRB- , and a culture of so-what promiscuity that has spawned illegitimacy and divorce , or so we read in the daily papers .
Are we overreacting ?
The last time we looked it was a very liberal Surgeon General trying to plug the burst dam of personal ruin with drug legalization and condoms .
The anniversary might have been more interesting if it had been seen as an occasion to be more balanced about the aftermath .
But the generation that `` came of age '' at Woodstock -- or at least its most insistent members -- is still too much in love with itself for any such clear-eyed look back .
The members of the Woodstock generation -- now writing for news magazines and producing TV news and running PBS fund drives -- seem very much to need an `` authentic '' memory of their cultural moment .
And indeed by all accounts , the spirit of the recent event in Saugerties , N.Y. , was true to its origins .
When it was all over , the muddy site was littered with abandoned tents , coolers , mattresses , beach chairs and shoes .
Many of those interviewed complained that the organizers had not done enough to `` take care '' of them during this latest re-creation of the trials of Valley Forge .
We guess that includes picking up after them .
By now the veterans of Woodstock II have washed most of the mud away and are heading toward their own 25-year odyssey of adulthood .
Perhaps they will take the advice so many of their forebears did not : Enjoy the commemorative CD -- but grow up .
PROVIDENCE , R.I. -- Textron Inc. 's Bell Helicopter unit settled an arbitration claim against it by the government of Iran for $ 30 million of equipment .
Under the settlement , Bell will ship five new commercial helicopters to Iran and provide training and spare parts .
Although most commerce with Iran is prohibited , a Bell spokesman said Washington was aware of the settlement .
A Commerce Department spokesman said U.S. policy would allow the sale if the contract was signed before the U.S. ban on commerce with Iran went into effect in 1979 .
Iran said it was owed more than $ 200 million in equipment and services based on payments made in the 1970s to Bell to establish an Iranian helicopter industry before the fall of Iran 's shah .
Bell said the agreement does n't set any precedents for trade with Iran -- a sentiment echoed in Washington .
`` If you were to walk into the Commerce Department today and say you want to ship commercial helicopters to Iran , it would be denied , '' the Commerce Department spokesman said .
He added that similar suits are unlikely .
ALBUQUERQUE , N.M. -LRB- -LRB- AP -RRB- -- A woman who was scalded when her McDonald 's Corp. coffee spilled was awarded almost $ 2.9 million by a jury .
Lawyers for Stella Liebeck , who incurred third-degree burns in the 1992 incident , contended that McDonald 's coffee was too hot .
On Wednesday , a state district court jury imposed $ 2.7 million in punitive damages and $ 160,000 in compensatory damages .
Defense attorney Tracy McGee has said the company will appeal .
Ms. Liebeck 's medical bills totaled almost $ 10,000 , according to one of her attorneys .
Testimony indicated that McDonald 's coffee is served at between 180 and 190 degrees , based on advice from a coffee consultant who has said the beverage tastes best at that temperature , Ken Wagner , one of Ms. Liebeck 's attorneys , said yesterday .
The lawsuit contended that Ms. Liebeck 's coffee was between 165 and 170 degrees when it spilled .
In contrast , the complaint said , coffee brewed at home is generally between 135 and 140 degrees .
Things are finally beginning to look up for yield-hungry investors .
After a relentless slide that lasted nearly five years , short-term interest rates are rising steadily .
While the stock and bond markets languish , yields on Treasury bills , money-market mutual funds and even bank certificates of deposit look better than they have in years .
Conservative investors , who watched nervously while yields on their money funds and short-term CDs dwindled to less than 3 % , can now get in the neighborhood of 5 % by seeking out top rates .
Yields will rise still higher as the Federal Reserve 's latest rate increase flows through to investors .
`` Investors are seeing yields they were n't able to envision a year ago , '' says David H. Diesslin , a financial planner in Fort Worth , Texas .
`` There are some real opportunities to go shop .
'' For now , Treasury bills have responded most directly to the Fed 's decision earlier this week to push up short-term rates another half a percentage point .
A six-month Treasury bill , for instance , was priced to yield 5.12 % in trading yesterday , compared with 3.34 % during the first week of January .
Treasury notes , which mature in two-to-10 years , are up nicely , too .
Five-year notes , for example , are now yielding 6.90 % , compared with 5.26 % in early January .
Treasury securities are easy to buy , either directly from the nearest branch of the Federal Reserve Bank or , for a small fee , through a bank or brokerage firm .
The Treasury has set an auction of five-year notes for next Wednesday and an auction of two-year notes for next Tuesday .
Three-month and six-month T-bills are auctioned weekly , usually on Mondays , and one-year bills are sold every four weeks .
Money-fund yields also directly reflect increases in interest rates -- although it takes a while for the yields paid to investors to catch up with a rise in rates on Treasury bills and other direct money-market investments .
The average maturity of taxable funds ' investments is 39 days , which means that it will be a little more than a month before the full effects of Tuesday 's Fed action are felt .
Top-Performing Fund At 3.96 % , compared with 2.78 % at the start of the year , the average yield on taxable funds for the week ended Tuesday almost fully reflected the Fed 's earlier increases .
The Fed began raising rates in February , and with the latest move , has now increased short-term rates by 1.75 percentage points .
The top-performing fund for the week ended Tuesday , the Benham Prime Money Market Fund , yielded 4.84 % , according to Money Fund Report , an Ashland , Mass. , newsletter .
Money funds certainly look better than money-market deposit accounts at major banks , which are yielding an average 2.40 % , up a smidgen from 2.32 % at the start of the year , according to Bank Rate Monitor newsletter in North Palm Beach , Fla. .
Unlike money funds , which pass through their income from investments in the form of yield , rates on bank deposits are set by financial institutions in response to such factors as competition and their need for funds , as well as interest-rate trends .
While yields on CDs are up more , they , too , do n't fully reflect this year 's increases in interest rates .
The average on six-month CDs , for instance , has risen less than a percentage point to 3.53 % .
`` Banks are flush with cash , '' says Robert K. Heady , publisher of Bank Rate Monitor .
`` Loan demand is weak relative to how much cash there is to borrow .
'' For now , Mr. Heady says , banks are holding down increases in personal loan rates to encourage borrowing .
Once loan demand increases , they can be expected to increase rates on deposits .
Mortgage rates have pretty well tracked Fed boosts .
The national average on 30-year fixed-rate loans is 8.70 % , up from 7.30 % in January , according to HSH Associates , a Butler , N.J. , research firm .
But rates are up far less on such personal debt as new car loans , unsecured personal loans and credit cards .
The average interest rate on credit cards , weighted by market share , rose to 17.36 % this month from 16.73 % in January , according to a survey by RAM Research Corp. , Frederick , Md. .
Mr. Heady predicts CD yields will rise 30 to 40 basis points , or hundredths of a percentage point , by Columbus Day .
CD investors `` never see all '' of a Fed increase , he says .
The question for yield-hungry investors is , of course , how much higher can rates go .
`` If the economy does n't show some signs '' of slowing , `` the Fed could conceivably raise rates through next summer , '' says Mr. Diesslin , the Fort Worth planner .
But he does n't expect another increase for at least three to four months .
This year 's upturn in interest rates is eerily similar to the cycle that began in February 1987 , says Mr. Heady .
Rates continued to rise until the spring of 1989 , typical of interest-rate cycles , which usually last 18 months to three years .
`` This cycle has just begun , it 's in its infancy , '' he says .
Financial professionals recommend that investors stay with shorter-term investments while interest rates are rising , because their market value varies less in response to rate changes .
`` Someone who 's fairly conservative is better off with five-to-10 years '' than investing for 30 years , says Ronald W. Roge , a financial planner in Centereach , N.Y. `` You can get 85 % to 90 % of the return with 20 % of the risk .
'' The current 6.90 % yield on a five-year Treasury note , for instance , is 92 % of the 7.48 % yield on a 30-year bond .
Norsk Hydro AS , Oslo , the Norwegian oil , gas and fertilizer company , signed agreements to divest all of the shares in its Danish Norsk Hydro Udforskning AS unit to Amerada Hess Ltd. .
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed .
The NH Udforskning subsidiary holds two licenses in Danish offshore fields in blocs 7\/89 and 8\/89 .
In addition to the sale of the Danish interests , Hydro said it reached agreements to sell its 25 % interest in the Mjoelner field on the Norwegian shelf close to the Danish border to Amerada .
The field was declared commercial in 1992 and recoverable reserves are estimated at 1.5 million cubic meters of oil and 700 million cubic meters of natural gas .
Enticed by low monthly payments and heavy promotional campaigns , hundreds of thousands of Americans decided two or three years ago to lease their cars instead of buying them .
Now those leases are expiring , and the people who hold them face a crucial decision about what to do .
Many of them are -- or soon will be -- getting intriguing offers from their leasing companies and auto dealers .
`` The offers always sound tempting , but you 've got to be cautious , '' says Art Spinella , vice president of CNW Marketing\/Research , a Bandon , Ore. , market-research firm that specializes in autos .
`` No one will make you an offer if it does n't make them money .
'' Many people will probably decide simply to turn their cars in and walk away .
After all , the absence of a long-term commitment is one of the real beauties of leasing , particularly for people who like to drive a new car every other year or so .
But just handing back the keys is n't always the smartest move .
For one thing , `` excess wear and damage '' charges , `` disposition fees '' and `` excess-mileage charges '' can make ending a lease a lot less simple than many people expect .
Some may also find that they can drive a good deal by re-leasing the same car for another two years or exercising their option to buy it .
And some lucky individuals will be able to pocket windfalls by purchasing their cars at the prices set in their lease agreements and then reselling the vehicles on the open market .
Used sport utility vehicles and vans , for instance , often sell for $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 more than the people leasing them would have to pay to purchase them at the end of their leases .
`` Demand is outrageously high for the Chevrolet Blazer , the Ford Explorer and the Jeep Cherokee , '' says Mr. Spinella .
`` No one expected sport utility vehicles to be that hot .
'' So it pays to do your homework .
The place to start is the car 's `` residual '' value specified in the lease contract .
Usually stated as a dollar amount representing a percentage of the vehicle 's original sticker price , the residual value is the leasing company 's estimate of the car 's value when the lease expires .
Many -- but not all -- contracts give lease holders the option of buying their cars at the end of the lease for the residual value .
But used-car prices are volatile , and since the residual value is set when the lease is signed , it can be wide of the mark two or three years later when the lease expires .
If the residual value is more than what it would cost you to buy a similar used car , then it is probably wise to just let the lease expire .
But if the residual turns out to be low , you can come out ahead by keeping the car or buying it and then reselling it .
How do you know if the residual is high , low or right-on-target ?
Get a good estimate of your car 's market value by checking the prices for similar cars in the local newspaper and a used-car price guide , such as the Kelley Blue Book or the National Auto Dealers Association Used Car Price Book , available at many libraries .
Or visit two or three auto dealers and ask them what they 'd pay for your car .
Then , compare your residual value with your car 's market value .
Right now , prices for many two - and three-year-old cars are stronger than predicted when leases were set , says Randal McCathren , president of Bank Lease Consultants , a Nashville , Tenn. , auto-lease consulting firm .
Sometimes the difference is n't great .
Say you leased a Ford Taurus two years ago .
According to the Automotive Lease Guide , a widely followed industry publication , leases signed two years ago usually set the Taurus 's residual value in 1994 at $ 8,425 .
By checking around , you 'd probably find a current market price for the same car of $ 8,650 , says Douglas Aiken , publisher of the Lease Guide .
That means you could buy the car you 've been driving for $ 225 less than you might expect to pay for another two-year-old Taurus .
Although that is n't much of a savings , it might still be worth purchasing the car if it has low mileage and is in good condition .
Unlike a used car you 'd buy from someone else , you know your car 's history and exactly how it was serviced , says Mr. Aiken .
But suppose that instead of a Taurus , you had leased a Ford Explorer , a popular sport utility vehicle .
In that case , you 're in the driver 's seat .
While the market price of a two-year-old Explorer is around $ 14,500 , Mr. Aiken says , the residual value set in leases in 1992 was about $ 12,625 -- a difference of $ 1,875 .
If you liked the car , you could buy it and hang on to it , knowing you were saving nearly $ 2,000 compared with the cost of buying a similar used car .
Or , you could buy it , then resell it and pocket a tidy profit .
Either choice would make more financial sense than turning that car in and allowing the dealer to get the extra cash .
`` You 'd be surprised at how many people do just that , '' Mr. McCathren says .
Be wary when dealers call before the lease is up , offering to get you out of your lease early and to put you into a new car at a similar monthly payment .
Although it could be a good deal , it also could be that the dealer figures he can make more money selling your car to another buyer than from selling it to you at your residual value , leasing pros say .
Sometimes , the clear choice is to let the lease expire .
For example , the current market value of a Jaguar XJ6 luxury sedan is typically $ 2,276 below the residual value set in leases three years ago , Mr. Aiken says .
If you buy the Jag at the residual value , you 'll be paying over $ 2,000 more than it would cost to buy a similar three-year-old car .
What about extending a lease for one , two or three more years ?
While this may be a worthwhile option in some cases , it pays to go cautiously .
You should compare not only your car 's residual value with its market value , but also what it would cost to re-lease it with what it would cost you to lease a new car of the same make , Mr. Spinella says .
Sometimes special factory-subsidized deals make it cheaper to lease a new car or a used car with fewer miles than re-lease your old one , says Mr. Spinella .
`` You have to go through the same mental gyrations you went through when you decided to lease or buy in the first place , '' says Mr. Spinella .
After everything is said and done , many people will decide to let their leases expire .
If you are one of them , it may be possible to save hundreds of dollars in charges and fees by checking the following before you turn in your car : EXCESS WEAR AND TEAR : Every lease contract has a provision that drivers must pay extra to repair damage to the car that is more than normal .
What 's more than normal is `` subject to interpretation , '' says Mr. McCathren , the Nashville consultant .
Certainly , bald tires , cracked windshields , large dents and scrapes qualify .
If your car is in need of repairs , you 're far better off having them done at your neighborhood repair shop , instead of having the dealer charge you to fix the car , says Philip Reed , editor of the book `` Lease Cars : How to Get One .
'' `` You can get it done much cheaper yourself , '' he says .
It 's a good idea to take pictures of your car before you turn it in to the dealer , documenting its condition .
And get a copy of the inspection sheet the dealer wrote up when you turned over the keys .
If the dealer says the repairs are to be extensive and costly , and you do n't agree , get an independent appraisal .
In some cases if the dealer wo n't take the car back without you paying costly repair charges , you may be better off buying the car , Mr. Reed says .
EXCESS MILEAGE : Most contracts allow 15,000 miles a year and charge 8 cents to 15 cents a mile for any excess .
Drivers who have put too many excess miles on the car may be better off buying it instead of paying the excess-mileage fees , says Rodney J. Couts , executive director of the National Vehicle Leasing Association , a trade group .
DISPOSITION FEES : Some dealers and leasing companies also impose a `` disposition fee '' -- a charge for transporting and selling the car .
These fees can run $ 300 or more .
Luckily , all these fees are negotiable to some extent -- especially for those with a hot car that the dealer already has orders for .
If you leased your car with the credit arm of , say , Ford Motor Co. , your lease is with the credit company and not a specific dealer , says Mr. Spinella .
That means it 's possible to shop various Ford dealers to see which will give you the best deal .
To Buy or Give Up Your Leased Auto ?
HACKENSACK , N.J. -- First Data Corp. said the Federal Trade Commission has cleared the way for it to acquire Western Union Financial Services Inc. if it is the successful bidder at a September bankruptcy auction .
First Data said it agreed that if it is successful , it will divest itself of certain marketing and sales functions of its own money-transfer business or of Western Union 's within 15 months after a consent decree with the FTC becomes final .
First Data , however , could continue to process transactions for both companies .
`` Keeping the processing business was key for us in the agreement , '' said spokesman Gary P. Tobin .
`` It appears probable that there will be other bidders , '' said Warren Bechtel , a spokesman for Western Union 's parent , New Valley Corp. .
First Data and Forstmann Little & Co. already have indicated interest in the business .
New Valley has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings for more than a year .
First Data initially bid $ 480 million for the business , but gradually boosted the figure to $ 660 million , after New York-based Forstmann made a surprise counteroffer of $ 650 million .
The court will begin receiving bids Sept. 2 , with a Sept. 19 deadline .
The FTC said the agreement includes stipulations that First Data make a good faith effort to maintain both marketing and sales operations while it decides which function to drop if its bid is successful .
First Data offers its own MoneyGram business in conjunction with American Express Co. .
Under the agreement , First Data must transfer a comparable number of contracted sales and marketing employees , and provide six months of training to a buyer of that portion of the competing money-transfer business , the FTC said .
`` It 's a nice balance , '' said Casey Triggs from the FTC 's Bureau of Competition .
`` It provides antitrust relief without necessarily hindering First Data 's ability to do business .
'' But Jeffrey Silverman , a money-transfer agent in Chicago , said he worries that the FTC agreement with First Data `` does n't have enough teeth .
'' He said that having an American Express-backed product competing against well-established Western Union has resulted in better service and lower prices across the industry .
Many fear , he said , that First Data would shift its American Express backing to Western Union .
If the MoneyGram operations go to a weaker competitor , `` the end result will be one player in the marketplace again , '' said Mr. Silverman of MS Management Corp. `` The industry is very concerned .
'' First Data declined to comment on whether it might sell its own money-transfer business in favor of Western Union 's older , more-established line .
First Data is a provider of information-processing and related services to the transaction-card , teleservices , mutualfund and other businesses .
Its moneytransfer business is three years old .
INSURERS were dealt a blow as California 's Supreme Court swept aside constitutional objections to a referendum designed to roll back insurance rates for consumers .
The court ruled that imposing a 10 % operating profit margin on insurers is neither unfair nor unconstitutional .
Consumer advocates and others said the decision could embolden other states to push ahead with tough rules on insurers .
The U.S. trade deficit narrowed slightly in June as the strength of the economy made for strong imports and exports .
Analysts predict the deficit will remain large , narrowing slightly at the end of 1994 or early 1995 .

Whirlpool will build European-style washing machines in the U.S. in 1996 , three years ahead of energy-efficiency rules that could force appliance makers to produce such machines .
Sony posted a 39 % drop in consolidated pretax profit for its first quarter , reflecting the high yen and the company 's slumping movie business .
Four California agencies are investigating state officials who were paid or hired by Tandem Computers after they reviewed Tandem 's performance as the main vendor of a system for the Department of Motor Vehicles .
Nike said its first-quarter results will fall short of expectations because sales have been better than anticipated and it ca n't fill orders fast enough .
The weakness would be recouped in the second quarter , it said .
Sandoz Pharmaceuticals said that in response to `` unwarranted criticism '' it will stop marketing its drug Parlodel as a lactation suppressant .
Volkswagen posted its first quarterly profit in two years , reflecting its restructuring and improved demand .
Airbus Industrie named Nicholas Tomassetti of McDonnell Douglas to head its North American operations .
Euro Disney 's top financial officer left the company .
People close to Euro Disney said Michael Montgomery felt he had completed his task of restructuring the theme park 's finances .

Xylogics Inc. , continuing to shift emphasis to the growing computer networking business , expects to report fiscal third-quarter earnings rose about 55 % on 20 % higher revenue , said Bruce Sachs , president and chief executive officer .
For the third quarter ended July 31 , Xylogics expects to report net income of about $ 900,000 , or 33 cents a share , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 573,000 , or 21 cents a share , Mr. Sachs said .
Revenue rose to about $ 13 million from $ 10.9 million .
Mr. Sachs said he expects continuing strong growth of the company 's sales and earnings .
Analysts ' projections that the company will earn about $ 1.23 a share in fiscal 1994 are `` reasonable , '' he added .
For fiscal 1993 , Xylogics , of Burlington , Mass. , earned $ 2.4 million , or 86 cents a share .
Recent debates between Congress and the Federal Reserve have an Alice-in-Wonderland flavor .
Sen. Paul Sarbanes -LRB- D. , Md. -RRB- , among others , has criticized Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan for the recent increases in interest rates .
The belief here is , first , that the Federal Reserve controls these rates , and second , that the Fed has chosen capriciously to raise them in order to choke off the economic recovery .
Mr. Greenspan 's response seems to be to acknowledge that the Federal Reserve controls interest rates , but to argue that the increases in rates have been necessary to maintain low inflationary expectations .
In this view , further increases in interest rates will be needed if the economy 's growth becomes too rapid to be consistent with low inflation .
-LRB- Unexplained here , or in most textbooks on macroeconomics , is why an expanded quantity of goods and services is supposed to raise the price level .
-RRB- Both views are mistaken about the nature of the recent increases in interest rates .
The recent rise in real rates is a symptom of an improving economic situation and has nothing to do with Fed policy .
Basically , real rates are high when growth prospects are good and investment demand is correspondingly strong .
In 1992 and 1993 real interest rates had been stuck around zero because of a weak world economy .
Rates have since increased with global economic prospects , but the recent level of real rates , 1.9 % to 2 % , is not high by historical standards ; it is just about the average since 1961 .
Real rates remain well below the average of 3 % that prevailed during the period of high growth and robust investment from 1984 to 1989 .
Mr. Greenspan could have told senators that the Federal Reserve lacks any strong or sure influence over expected real interest rates , even in the short run .
These rates are determined by the interplay between the supply and demand of credit , determined by the willingness of people all over the world to save and their desire to invest .
Mr. Greenspan might also have argued that the Fed ought not to try to counteract fluctuations in real interest rates .
Rather , the Fed 's mission is to ensure that these fluctuations occur against a background of low and stable inflation , the variable that it does control .
In this respect , the Fed has been highly successful in recent years .
I guess the reason that Mr. Greenspan does not make these kinds of arguments -LRB- aside from the unlikely chance that he disagrees with my economic analysis -RRB- is that he would have to confess to possessing much less power than is generally assumed .
He would have to acknowledge that the Fed is mainly a passive observer with respect to movements in real interest rates .
In particular , given that the Fed managed in recent months to maintain low and stable inflation , he would have to say that the rises in short-term nominal rates were not separate policy decisions , but were rather constraints imposed by the world 's financial markets .
-LRB- Probably some senators would react to this confession by saying that if the current chairman lacks the power to control real interest rates -- in particular , to lower them -- then someone with more skill ought to be appointed to the job .
-RRB- Most economists think that investment responds more to long-term real interest rates than to short-term rates .
But these long-term real rates are even less responsive than short-term rates to monetary policy .
Even long-term nominal rates are difficult to control because they depend on long-term inflationary expectations .
The Fed has a lot of influence over inflation and , hence over short-term inflationary expectations .
But it has little power to affect beliefs about the distant future , that is , about the behavior of future Federal Reserve Boards and chairmen .
It is also hard to know how to divide observed long-term nominal rates -- such as the 30-year government bond yield shown in the chart -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- WSJ August 19 , 1994 -RRB- -- into real rates and expected inflation .
The problem is that reliable direct estimates of long-term inflationary expectations do not exist for the U.S. .
One imperfect method is to use the figures on long-term real interest rates for the United Kingdom .
These data are available because the U.K. government issues indexed bonds -LRB- on which the payouts adjust automatically for changes in a retail price index -RRB- , and the prices of these bonds provide direct information about real interest rates .
-LRB- Perhaps the U.S. government will one day also issue indexed bonds .
-RRB- The chart shows the behavior of these long-term real rates since 1984 .
If the long-term real rate in the U.S. is similar to that in the U.K. , then the difference between the 30-year U.S. government bond yield and the U.K. real rate provides a rough estimate of long-term expected inflation in the U.S. Because the fluctuations in long-term expected inflation are usually much greater than those in real rates , the changes in the nominal yield are usually a good guide to the movements in long-run inflationary expectations .
For example , the decrease in the 30-year bond yield from 13.4 % in mid-1984 to 7.3 % in mid-1986 corresponds to a fall in expected inflation from 10 % to 3.9 % .
This period was crucial in the restoration of long-run credibility for low inflation .
In recent years , shifts in long-term real rates and in long-run expected inflation have contributed roughly equally to the fluctuations in the 30-year bond yield .
From November 1992 to October 1993 , the yield fell from 7.6 % to 5.9 % , while the real rate declined from 3.9 % to 3.2 % and expected inflation fell from 3.7 % to 2.7 % .
Then , from October 1993 to today , the yield rose back to 7.6 % , while the real rate returned to 3.9 % and expected inflation advanced back to 3.7 % .
The recent rise in long-term real rates is a good sign about the world economy .
It suggests that long-run prospects for growth and investment are improved relative to those that prevailed last fall .
The news from higher long-term nominal rates is , however , not at all good .
It also means that long-term expected inflation has risen by a full percentage point since last fall .
This weakening of long-run credibility is disturbing , but it is unclear whether the Fed and its current chairman can counteract it .
The president and Congress have a little more long-term influence through their control over legislation and appointments .
Apparently , the financial markets have examined this record and have decided to add another percentage point to the forecast of long-run inflation .
I have no reason to quarrel with this prediction .

MEXICO CITY -- When Mexicans go to the polls Sunday to elect a new president , among the millions watching will be two close friends whose divergent paths neatly symbolize the opposing forces fighting for the soul of this nation .
Ulises Beltran and Primitivo Rodriguez are part of the generation that was scarred by the government 's slaughter of hundreds of students demonstrating against authoritarianism in 1968 .
In the years since , these best of friends have achieved prominence at opposite ends of the political spectrum , holding positions that reflect the two contrasting views on Mexico 's future that have likewise split millions of their countrymen .
On one side are those who , like Dr. Beltran , think things are changing as fast as they can .
Many of them acknowledge that the government has often been authoritarian and corrupt .
But they are well aware of Mexico 's unbelievably bloody revolution early this century .
And they are willing to give up some democracy in return for the stability that the ruling party has provided in its uninterrupted 65-year reign .
On the other side are those who , like Mr. Rodriguez , hope Mexico is just at the beginning of a crucial political opening .
They want to push the country toward democratic reform as fast as possible and see Sunday 's elections as their best chance .
They vow to continue their fight as long as necessary .
So far , both sides can claim some victories .
Most of the latest polls show Ernesto Zedillo , the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , with a comfortable lead over his nearest rival , Diego Fernandez , making it likely that the PRI will extend its run as the world 's longest-ruling party .
Still , with foreign investors gaining influence and insisting on a fair vote , the elections are expected to be the cleanest in Mexican history .
The PRI may lose control of one of the houses of Congress for the first time , and Dr. Zedillo has indicated that if he wins he will probably ask members of the opposition to serve in his cabinet -- another first .
Dr. Zedillo has even said he would give up the president 's privilege of designating his party 's next presidential candidate in six years .
That less-than-democratic tradition has been one of the main perks of the office and has guaranteed the president 's near-total power over subordinates .
But the fight is just beginning , and as the Indian rebellion in the southern state of Chiapas in January showed , some people are willing to die for what they believe .
To understand how feelings can run so deep , it is necessary to look back to 1968 , when Dr. Beltran and Mr. Rodriguez were college students .
Mr. Rodriguez , now 49 years old and a social activist , was the more conservative of the two .
He grew up in a poor family in rural Michoacan and was raised to be devoted to the Catholic Church .
He was a Jesuit seminarian until he was 24 and supported the conservative , church-oriented opposition party , the National Action Party .
During the Bay of Pigs invasion to oust Fidel Castro from Cuba , for instance , Mr. Rodriguez wound up at a prayer vigil at the national basilica of Mexico City .
`` If some people were giving up their lives to rescue Cuba from communism and give it back to God , why should n't we kneel all night ?
'' he recalls thinking .
But a wrenching shift by some Latin American priests in the mid-1960s opened the way for new thinking .
The `` liberation theology '' that emerged as one of the new currents in the church intrigued Mr. Rodriguez , because it offered a rationale for aiding the poor in concrete , earthly ways .
Then in 1968 , with Mexico about to play host to the Olympics , the government moved to suppress the unruly student movement before it could embarrass the country -- and opened fire on the protesters .
The gory scene , Mr. Rodriguez says , changed him forever .
He began to move to the left .
Dr. Beltran was already there .
The son of a Mexico City radical who had worked with Cuban exiles in the 1950s to support the revolution that put Castro in power , Dr. Beltran , now 45 , says he was never really a Marxist , because his father was also an engineer-mathematician who had taught him to be analytical .
He says friends in those days would `` talk about class struggle , and I 'd say , ` What does that mean ?
Let 's measure it .
' '' Still , he was immersing himself in some radical German sociology and was involved in the 1968 student protests .
It was n't until 1971 that Dr. Beltran and Mr. Rodriguez met , while they were in a small Ph.D. program in history at the prestigious Colegio de Mexico in Mexico City .
Though Mr. Rodriguez is a few years older and had already finished his classes by the time Dr. Beltran arrived , each admired an intellectual honesty in the other .
`` Primitivo is absolutely honest , '' Dr. Beltran says .
Mr. Rodriguez responds in kind : `` We have something in common -- tolerance .
And that is something in the Mexican culture that is new and young and weak .
'' The friendship deepened as the two spent the following decade as semi-professional students .
While at the Colegio de Mexico , they frequently stayed up all night drinking and talking , often around Dr. Beltran 's father-in-law at the time , Ricardo Garibay , a writer whose ideas challenged the younger men .
By the late 1970s , both Dr. Beltran and Mr. Rodriguez were studying Mexican history at the University of Chicago .
There , they founded what Dr. Beltran calls a commune , where a dozen students and their families would gather to eat at night .
They also formed a group of Latin American students and produced a newsletter .
Dr. Beltran says they got a little money from a student organization , but `` we had to defend the funding every other week because some student organization or other would accuse us of being Communist .
'' When the two friends left the university in 1982 , the situation in Mexico was , in many ways , even more dire than it had been in 1968 .
The country had lurched to the left in the early 1970s under nationalist President Luis Echeverria -- who concentrated even more power in the office -- and this trend continued under his successor , Jose Lopez Portillo .
When world oil prices crashed in the early 1980s , so did the Mexican economy .
With no business interests strong enough to stand up to the president , his power was now absolute , but there was n't much left to control .
What Mexicans still call `` the crisis '' had begun .
Mr. Rodriguez headed into social activism .
For a time , he became a consultant to the Socialist Party in Mexico .
In the U.S. , he helped found an immigrant-rights network .
As director of the Mexico-U.S. project for the American Friends Service Committee , he crusaded against abuses of Mexican workers in foreign plants .
With this year 's elections coming , he returned to Mexico as one of the leaders of the Civic Alliance , the largest election watchdog group in the country , which has issued numerous reports on media bias and on coercion by the ruling party .
Mr. Rodriguez , a bachelor , lives a Spartan existence , staying in a boarding house on a church plaza in a bohemian district of Mexico City .
He wears his thinning hair slicked back , favors black jeans and would n't think of owning a suit .
His one indulgence is a passion for photography .
As for Dr. Beltran , he found little opportunity for work in the rattled Mexico of 1982 .
A contact got him a research job with the Colegio de Mexico , but that lasted only a few months .
Then another contact got him a job helping write the official history of the presidency of Miguel de la Madrid , who took office in 1982 .
That was when Dr. Beltran began to change , Mr. Rodriguez says .
Mexico has traditionally maintained a sharp divide between those in power and those out .
Dr. Beltran was now on the inside .
`` He needed money .
I did n't , '' Mr. Rodriguez says .
`` He has tasted power , and he loved it .
'' After finishing the history , Dr. Beltran moved to the Finance Ministry in 1987 , becoming a chief adviser .
He later joined the presidential campaign of Carlos Salinas de Gortari , who took office in 1988 .
For the past six years , Dr. Beltran has been the president 's pollster and an adviser .
The elegant , silver-haired Dr. Beltran now lives a comfortable life , going home from his office across the street from the president 's to take a nap most afternoons , before returning to prepare reports for the president .
He lives in a modest home on a quiet street in the center of the city , where he has begun collecting art .
Dr. Beltran says he has n't changed since 1968 .
He says , rather , that the country has changed around him , that the country has given up its authoritarian tendencies and moved as far as he had hoped it would .
But a recent lunch with Mr. Rodriguez and Dr. Beltran shows just how far they have been pulled apart politically .
`` I have been a privileged observer of every election from 1988 on , and I know empirically that there has been not one alteration of a result , '' Dr. Beltran says .
Although many Mexicans think President Salinas won the 1988 election through fraud , Dr. Beltran says polls he did the day before the voting closely tracked the final results .
Dr. Beltran worries that some of the changes in Mexico may have gone too far .
While he supports President Salinas 's decision to drastically increase spending on social programs during a time of economic disruption , he also wonders whether Mexico might be heading back toward a welfare state .
`` There is no better welfare state than a sound economy that brings jobs and income to the people of a country , '' he says .
`` I do n't believe the idea that the left owns the concept of social justice , '' he adds , blaming leftists for disrupting Mexico this year .
Mr. Rodriguez scoffs at the notion that the 1988 election was fair or that the government is doing enough to help the poor .
He says that Mexico `` just is n't at peace with itself '' and wo n't be until it becomes much more democratic .
`` We have never in my generation had such a moral challenge , '' he says .
Dr. Beltran charges that Mr. Rodriguez and his Civic Alliance have n't made up their minds whether their role is to help authorities make the elections cleaner or whether they are around just to contest the elections and cause trouble .
He notes that the alliance issued a report about a housewife in Yucatan who saw a police car stuffed with Zedillo literature , which would be a clear violation of laws trying to separate the ruling party from the government .
`` I could just as easily issue a report saying that 460 housewives in the small town saw nothing wrong , '' Dr. Beltran says .
`` I have no problem with the PRI .
I think the PRI is the organization that gives the country its political center , and I think it ought to remain in power .
'' Dr. Beltran says that `` the elections are going to be the most uneventful event .
Bet on it .
'' Mr. Rodriguez shoots back , `` No way , man .
'' DEMOCRATS FEAR the Fed 's big rate rise portends a 1996 downturn .
The only time since World War II that Fed boosts have n't forced an economic slowdown was in the late 1960s , during the Vietnam War , analysts note .
Clinton , who has n't gotten much credit for the improving economy , `` will find himself stabbed in the back '' in 1996 , says Gerald Epstein , an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst .
Democratic Rep. Sabo writes Greenspan that `` you are seeing signs of inflation '' where `` I would see evidence of a healthy , well-functioning labor market .
'' The Clinton camp worries that the Fed may have been too late and prices will begin to creep up anyway .
That could cause another round of rate increases , boosting the likelihood of a pre-election downturn .
New Fed Vice Chairman Blinder has already done what his predecessor , David Mullins , never did : vote to raise interest rates .
MEXICO 'S ELECTION has U.S. officials rooting for a fraud-free vote .
Charges of massive fraud in Sunday 's vote would be a nightmare for Clinton , who promised that Nafta would help promote democracy and investment .
U.S. exports to Mexico have been surging since the free-trade pact went into effect .
A Mexican president elected fraudulently would be a big embarrassment for Clinton at December 's hemispheric summit in Miami .
The U.S. hopes that the ruling PRI party will win big enough to eclipse any vote disputes .
To deter fraud , the U.S. has spent about $ 1.5 million to help support first-ever international election monitors and train Mexican poll watchers .
A State Department official expects that any post-vote unrest will be `` localized and containable .

Dutch aerospace group Fokker NV , which is 51 % controlled by Daimler-Benz AG 's Deutsche Aerospace AG unit , said its net loss widened in the first half of the year as revenue shrank 34 % .
The Amsterdam-based company said the deepened losses reflected higher restructuring charges and lower profit margins for its aircraft due to price competition .
Despite restructurings and financial aid from the Dutch government , first-half net losses widened to 196 million guilders -LRB- $ 112.5 million -RRB- from 127 million guilders .
Fokker said financial restructurings and the formation of a leasing company would help it weather the downturn in the global aircraft industry and narrow its net losses in 1994 after swinging into 460 million guilders of net losses last year .
BancTexas Group Inc. , Dallas , said its shareholders approved a plan to sell $ 30 million in stock to First Banks Inc. , giving the closely held St. Louis banking company a 65 % stake in BancTexas .
Under the transaction , First Banks , controlled by the Dierberg family of St. Louis , will pay 80 cents a share for 37.5 million newly issued Class B common shares .
The Class B stock wo n't be traded or listed on any exchange , but will have the same voting rights as BancTexas 's regular common stock .
After five years , it will be convertible into the regular common stock on a share for share basis .
BancTexas has 20.1 million shares outstanding .
Though the 80-cent-a-share price is below the market price of BancTexas 's stock , the transaction will nonetheless increase the company 's book value to 72 cents a share from 59 cents , a spokesman said .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , BancTexas closed at $ 1.25 , unchanged .
In a major defeat for the insurance industry , California 's Supreme Court swept aside constitutional objections to a referendum designed to roll back rates for consumers .
The court unanimously upheld state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi 's rules for rebates under Proposition 103 , a state initiative passed in 1988 .
As a result , Mr. Garamendi predicted that California consumers would receive about $ 1 billion in rebates from about 700 insurers that had been delayed by legal challenges .
At issue in the case was whether a 10 % operating profit margin is unfair or unconstitutionally confiscatory .
A lower court , ruling in a suit by 20th Century Insurance Co. , had ruled against the formula for company profits set by Mr. Garamendi after he became commissioner in 1991 .
The state Supreme Court overturned that decision .
`` Not only is the rate-making formula not internally inconsistent , it is also not confiscatory , discriminatory or demonstrably irrelevant to legitimate policy , '' the Supreme Court said in a 135-page opinion .
Consumer advocates and other observers said the ruling would embolden other states to push ahead with tough rules on insurers and other industries .
`` Hopefully this will remove some of the uncertainty , '' said Karl Manheim , a constitutional-law professor at Loyola University who represented Voter Revolt , a consumer group that backed the law .
`` This is a vindication of California voters , '' added Harvey Rosenfield , who wrote the proposition .
`` Proposition 103 has already forced the industry to recognize that it needs to tighten its belt ... When a conservative court says so , they 've got to sit back and understand that the nature of the game has changed dramatically .
'' The decision was a heavy blow to 20th Century , a major Southern California insurance company already reeling from $ 685 million in losses from the January earthquake .
Other insurance-industry representatives were also rattled .
`` This is one of the most antibusiness decisions I 've seen come out of this court , '' said Dave Fountain , a spokesman for the Personal Insurance Federation of California , which represents large insurers .
`` What they are saying is insurance companies should be kept as weak as possible , which is not in the best interest of consumers and wo n't attract business to the state .
'' Tom Conneely , president of the Association of California Insurance Companies , said the decision may force the industry and regulators to focus on legal and hospital costs that hold down company profits .
`` We 're disappointed at the sweeping nature of this decision .
'' Proposition 103 imposed regulations on car insurance , homeowners ' insurance and other property and casualty coverage .
It required a 20 % rollback of rates and made the insurance commissioner an elected office .
The law was immediately challenged in court by insurers .
In an initial ruling in 1989 , the state Supreme Court upheld the initiative but said that companies must be given a chance to show that the full 20 % rollback would unconstitutionally deny them the right to earn a fair return .
More than 400 companies argued that the rollback should n't apply to them .
Mr. Garamendi , who recently lost a bid to receive the Democratic nomination for governor , replaced a case-by-case process for evaluating insurers ' appeals with a blanket set of regulations based on the 10 % rate of return .
To date , 35 insurance companies have voluntarily paid more than $ 800 million in rollbacks to about seven million policyholders .
Among companies that challenged Mr. Garamendi 's rules , Woodland Hills-based 20th Century , a unit of 20th Century Industries , was first to be heard .
Under the formula approved by the Supreme Court , the company owes policyholders rollbacks totaling over $ 119 million , including interest , the insurance agency said .
The decision puts intense pressure on a company that has been flirting with insolvency , analysts said .
20th Century 's surplus dwindled to $ 188 million at March 31 .
At June 30 , the parent company 's two main subsidiaries bolstered their combined capital to $ 251.8 million with a new bank line .
20th Century 's troubles recently forced it to withdraw from the homeowners ' insurance market .
Still , 20th Century `` ca n't afford to pay out much more than they had reserved , '' for the Proposition 103 matter , given the losses from the Northridge quake , '' said John H. Snyder , senior vice president of the property\/casualty division of A.M. Best Co. , an Oldwick , N. J , .
insurance rating service .
Mr. Snyder said the company has reserves of about $ 50 million , less than half the money the insurance department has demanded .
Other companies have settled their Proposition 103 liability with the insurance department for less than its initial demand , but the ruling could strengthen Mr. Garamendi 's hand .
There 's a real trade-off there , industry observers said .
`` If Garamendi goes for the jugular and tries to extract the maximum from the company , he could potentially weaken its financial condition to the point where he has a different problem , '' dealing with an insolvent company , Mr. Snyder said .
Mr. Ashley predicted 20th Century will be able to work out a settlement with Mr. Garamendi .
`` I 'm sure the insurance department is n't going to be so vindictive that they place our solvency in jeopardy , '' he said .
20th Century has historically offered some of the lowest automobile-insurance rates in California , he said .
`` We 've been the company that held rates in check .
'' Besides the rate of return , Mr. Garamendi said the new ruling upholds the commissioner 's authority in several areas , including the ability to create one set of regulations for the entire industry , and to prohibit companies from charging consumers for wasteful or improper expenditures .
Mr. Garamendi , who leaves office at the end of the year , criticized insurers for delays that cost taxpayers millions of dollars .
`` This case will influence many future decisions in cases well beyond the insurance industry , when the people decide to regulate in a new and different way , '' he said .
Gates\/FA Distributing Inc. said it reimbursed a vendor for an overcharge following the completion of a previously announced internal investigation of accounting practices .
A spokeswoman for the Greenville , S.C.-based microcomputer distributor would n't identify the vendor or the amount of the overcharge .
In a prepared statement , the company said the investigation 's findings and the reimbursement would n't have a `` material effect '' on the company 's financial condition or operating results for its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30 or its first quarter ending Sept. 30 .
Gates\/FA , responding to rumors that drove its stock down 18 % over two days last month , investigated accounting `` practices , procedures and internal controls .

Shoney 's Inc. said it has hired management consultants McKinsey & Company Inc. to help the restaurant company find ways to `` enhance its value to shareholders '' and strengthen its performance .
McKinsey will review , evaluate and make recommendations regarding the strategic direction of the company , according to Taylor H. Henry , Shoney 's chairman and chief executive officer .
Mr. Henry said the company 's goal is to `` gain every advantage we can in meeting the challenges of a highly competitive marketplace and grow our various businesses .
'' Shoney 's , based in Nashville , Tenn. , reported $ 16.9 million in net income , or 41 cents a share , on $ 277.5 million in revenue for the second quarter ended May 15 .
The company operates and franchises 1,865 restaurants in the U.S. and Canada .
WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission fined Piper Capital Management Inc. $ 35,000 for failing to properly disclose that it used its affiliate , Piper Jaffray Inc. , to execute principal transactions .
Piper Capital agreed to pay the fine and settle the case without admitting or denying the SEC 's allegations .
Piper Capital is required to disclose any principal transactions executed through an affiliated firm , the SEC said , but failed to disclose such transactions that occurred between January 1990 and March 1993 .
In a principal transaction , a client buys securities from a firm itself rather than on the open market .
Piper Capital and Piper Jaffray are units of Piper Jaffray Cos. , Minneapolis .
WASHINGTON -- Telecommunications company MCI Communications Corp. said it agreed with Motorola Inc. 's Information Systems Group unit to provide data-networking capabilities to businesses .
The companies said they will pursue customers -- from banks to health-care providers and government agencies -- that want to provide data on MCI 's Hyperstream Frame Relay Service .
Unlike MCI 's voice service , the relay service brings a network of data to business and residential customers , the companies said .
Motorola 's information unit , in Mansfield , Mass. , said it will provide computer and data terminals to businesses that want to add information to the system .
Motorola is based in Schaumburg , Ill. .
Nike Inc. said it wo n't meet analysts ' expectations for fiscal-first-quarter net income because its shoes have been selling better than anticipated and it ca n't fill orders fast enough .
The Beaverton , Ore. , footgear maker said that it expected to post net income of between $ 1.35 a share and $ 1.45 a share , instead of analysts ' estimates of $ 1.45 a share to $ 1.75 for the quarter ending Aug. 31 .
A year earlier , the company recorded net income of $ 1.49 a share .
The first-quarter weakness would be recouped in the second quarter , the company added .
Philip H. Knight , chairman and chief executive officer , said that conservative orders from retailers six months ago led Nike to maintain its lowest inventory in five years , causing some August shipments to be delayed until September after Nike 's shoes proved hotter with consumers than expected .
Jennifer Black Groves , an analyst at Black & Co. , said Nike has been benefiting from the surging popularity of outdoor footwear , which accounted for more than $ 150 million of its $ 1.87 billion in domestic shoe sales in its last fiscal year .
In the fourth quarter , outdoor sales jumped 47 % , with the company 's Air Deschutz sandals outselling every other Nike shoe .
`` Domestically , it 's shining and bright and things look wonderful , '' she said .
`` But internationally , Nike has trouble turning the corner .
The strength of the U.S. market will overshadow the weakness of the European market .
'' Ms. Black said that gross margins would be good on the shoes now in stores , because the strong demand would preclude any markdowns .
Mr. Knight said that costs had been higher than analysts forecast because of spending on new distributors in the Far East , World Cup marketing , a new shoe launch and the opening of a warehouse in Europe .
`` In fact , all the reasons for the shortfall in first-quarter earnings are bullish indicators of renewed vigor in consumer demand for Nike 's products , '' Mr. Knight said .
He said that analysts ' forecasts for the full year were on target at between $ 4.30 and $ 4.75 a share , up from $ 3.96 a year earlier .
In July , Nike reported that world-wide orders for the first half of its current fiscal year grew 10 % , with most of the strength in the second quarter .
The news was released after the market closed .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Nike closed at $ 65 , down 37.5 cents .
Quarterdeck Office Systems Inc. said it will cut its domestic work force by about 25 % , or 55 employees , as part of a restructuring expected to produce a charge in the fiscal fourth quarter ending Sept. 30 .
The Santa Monica , Calif.-based software company also said it reached an agreement in principle to settle securities class claims against the company , its officers and directors for $ 3.9 million .
The claims , which arose in 1992 after the company 's stock plunged in the face of lower-than-expected earnings , included allegations that the company failed to disclose tremendous competitive pressures and issued overly optimistic reports on its financial condition .
The company admitted no liability .
The announcement came after the close of trading .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading , Quarterdeck 's stock closed at $ 2.563 , down 6.25 cents .
Spartech Corp. will report `` some pretty good numbers '' when it releases fiscal third-quarter earnings early next week , said Bradley Buechler , Spartech 's president and chief executive .
The Clayton , Mo. , company makes plastics , alloys and compounds .
Mr. Buechler said sales in the quarter ended July 31 were in the $ 67 million to $ 69 million range , up about 35 % from the year-earlier period , and compared with what he said are analysts ' estimates of $ 64 million .
He said Spartech 's fiscal third-quarter net income will be about $ 2.9 million to $ 3 million , `` slightly above '' estimates of $ 2.8 million , and compared with the year-earlier net income of $ 1.8 million .
In composite trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange , Spartech shares closed at $ 4.625 , up 12.5 cents .
Montgomery Ward & Co. said its expects to report its 1994 revenue climbed about 17 % to $ 7 billion , compared with $ 6 billion last year .
The closely held retailer , which is based in Chicago , said earnings for the first half climbed 3 % to $ 38 million compared with the same period in 1993 .
Firsthalf revenue increased 12 % to $ 3 billion .
Montgomery Ward , which operates a chain of about 370 stores , said it plans to remodel 65 stores and add 15 stores this year .
Thermo Power Corp. formed a joint venture with Poland-based companies Mpec SA and Naftokrak-Naftobudowa and the Japan International Development Organization Ltd. , based in Tokyo , to supply emissions-control equipment to Poland .
The Waltham , Mass. , manufacturer of cogeneration and cooling systems said its Tecogen division , which will design and provide the equipment , will own 25 % of the venture initially , with an option to increase its equity share to 65 % , based upon certain performance criteria .
Thermo Power said the joint venture , called Ecogy , will be based in Krakow and will modernize boilers ranging in size from two to 100 megawatts .
Ecogy 's first project will be to modernize a coal-burning plant .
The U.S. Department of Energy will finance half of the $ 1 million project , Thermo Power said .
WASHINGTON -- Senate moderates are scaling back their compromise health-reform plan as lawmakers confront the huge cost and complexity of subsidy schemes to help lower-income families buy insurance .
The moderates ' steady rightward movement leaves Democratic liberals ever-more isolated in the debate .
No less than Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd -LRB- D. , W. Va. -RRB- announced last night that he wo n't support a more ambitious reform plan put forward by the party 's leadership .
The fraying nerves showed at a Democratic policy luncheon where Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee Chairman Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- engaged Sen. Robert Kerrey -LRB- D. , Neb. -RRB- in a sometimes heated exchange .
`` I just do n't sense movement in this body to pass legislation , '' said Mr. Kerrey , part of the moderate faction .
But Mr. Kennedy seemed unfazed last night , and sought to sound a positive note .
`` I think we can do business with many of these proposals , '' he said of the moderates ' ideas .
The pressures on the moderate bloc are both political and practical .
Minority Leader Robert Dole -LRB- R. , Kan. -RRB- is doing his best to see that Republicans in the group , led by Rhode Island 's Sen. John Chafee , do n't move too close to the Democratic leadership .
And there are immense hurdles in figuring out how to finance and administer subsidies that would amount to hundreds of billions of dollars during the next 10 years .
Staff cost estimates this week , followed by a meeting yesterday with Congressional Budget Office Director Robert Reischauer yesterday , have had a `` chastening '' effect on the Senate moderates , said Sen. John Danforth -LRB- R. , Mo. -RRB- .
At the same time , senators are showing a renewed desire to cut back on expenditures to show more deficit reduction as part of the reform effort .
`` We just do n't want to give away everything we save , '' said Sen. James Jeffords -LRB- R. , Vt. -RRB- .
Mr. Byrd sounded the same theme in a floor speech describing the health debate as `` one of the most discouraging of his political career .
'' `` It is essential that we not enact a plan that squanders our last real remaining chance for significant deficit reduction , '' said Mr. Byrd , who preceded Sen. George Mitchell of Maine as the Senate Democratic leader .
`` Our national heart may be large , but our national pocketbook , sadly , is quite small .
'' Such considerations are leading the `` mainstream '' coalition to retreat even further from the administration 's goal of assuring health coverage for all Americans and to limit the funds available to help poor and working-class families buy insurance .
The group already has cut back a new Medicare prescription-drug benefit and a long-term care program proposed by the Democrats .
And while it previously supported subsidies for families earning up to 240 % of the poverty line , the options under consideration last night would set a ceiling at 200 % of poverty or lower .
Subsidies for children also may be pared .
The moderates ' proposal is certain to fall short of even Mr. Mitchell 's interim goal of covering 95 % of all Americans .
But what frustrates many senators is the inefficiency of the various subsidy schemes , which have proven a crude substitute for the administration 's approach of requiring all employers to help pay for their workers ' insurance .
The subsidies in many cases would end up extending assistance to families who already have insurance .
`` If you look at the price tag and how much it produced for expanded coverage , it was very , very sobering , '' said Sen. David Durnberger -LRB- R. , Minn. -RRB- after yesterday 's meeting with CBO Director Reischauer .
The problem is illustrated by CBO cost estimates for Mr. Mitchell 's bill , which by 1998 would be providing subsidies to cover 67 million people .
The CBO figures indicate that almost one-third of those who would receive assistance already are insured to some degree through private means .
Yesterday 's meetings were a rollercoaster of emotions .
After the crowded morning meeting with Mr. Reischauer , the moderate bloc seemed in danger of falling apart .
But it came back together in the late afternoon .
Mr. Chafee met with Mr. Mitchell last evening , and the group hopes to begin more substantive discussions with Senate leaders after completing its proposal today .
Some Democrats , such as Mr. Kerrey and Florida 's Sen. Bob Graham , argue that the party would be best served by at least taking a step toward reform .
But unless the moderates can draw support from the left or right , they are n't enough alone to break the impasse .
That wo n't be easy .
The package is expected to scale back a proposed cigarette-tax increase to 45 cents a pack , but many conservative Republicans are reluctant to accept any tax increase .

Sylvan Learning Systems Inc. received approval from the school boards of Pasadena , Texas , and Dorchester County , Md. , to provide supplemental education services for a total of five schools .
In a news release , Sylvan said the approvals are multiyear agreements , together valued at about $ 1.8 million .
Sylvan said it has been working under contract within public school districts in Baltimore since May 1993 and Washington , D.C. since May .
The company , based in Columbia , Md. , said it will provide math and reading instruction to about 300 students in two schools in Pasadena and about 180 students in three schools in Dorchester County .
The company said it will offer its traditional fee-for-service tutoring services to families able to pay using the same school-based facilities after school .
American Cyanamid Co. shareholders will be the big winners in American Home Products Corp. 's takeover of their company .
Thousands of Cyanamid employees might be the big losers .
American Home 's proposed $ 9.7 billion acquisition of American Cyanamid will be financially successful only if American Home sharply reduces costs of the combined pharmaceutical operations , analysts said .
`` It 's extremely unlikely they would have bought Cyanamid without the idea that they were going to close plants and lay a lot of people off , '' said Jack Lamberton , an analyst at NatWest Securities .
American Home is likely to cut between 2,000 and 5,000 jobs immediately and more than 10,000 total over the next two years , predicted Hemant Shah , an independent analyst .
Most of the job cuts are likely to come out of American Cyanamid 's drug operation , analysts said .
American Cyanamid employed 26,550 at the end of the year , while American Home employed 51,399 .
An American Home spokesman said it was `` premature '' to comment on plans .
American Home needs to cut costs sharply in order to come up with an estimated $ 700 million to $ 800 million a year to service its $ 9 billion in debt after the merger , analysts estimated .
But slashing costs can cover much of those cash needs , analysts said .
Selling , administrative , and research and development expenses generally run about 50 % of revenue , said D. Larry Smith , of Hambrecht & Quist .
By cutting that to 40 % , American Home can save $ 400 million or about half of what it needs to service the debt , he estimated .
Cash flow from the operations would pay for the rest , he added .
`` This transaction broadens the product line , allows them to repay debt , and it funds itself , amazingly enough , '' Mr. Smith said .
Cutting costs means largely closing plants and laying off people , probably in manufacturing , sales and administration , analysts said .
But they point out that while layoffs are easily accomplished domestically , they are problematic overseas , where governments are the primary buyers of pharmaceuticals .
State health plans meddle in what drug companies can charge for a product .
If a drug company cuts its expenses , the government could demand that the company lower prices .
Analysts expect American Home to be fairly aggressive in slashing costs , based on their observation of the company 's acquisition of A.H. Robins Co. in 1989 .
American Home bought Robins 's `` top line , '' or product sales , `` leaving its cost structure behind , '' Mr. Lamberton said .
An American Home spokesman denied that the company slashed Robins jobs .
The company has retained all but about 100 of the 1,422 jobs it acquired with Robins , he said .
An American Home spokesman said the company expects the American Cyanamid deal will reduce earnings somewhat in the short term but will eventually add to its earnings .
Mr. Shah estimated earnings will be reduced by 8 % to 10 % next year , with the company reporting $ 4.75 a share .
The company spokesman declined to comment on analysts ' earnings projections .
Another casualty of the takeover may be American Home 's triple-A credit rating .
Analysts say the $ 9 billion that American Home plans to borrow to finance the takeover could drive its credit rating to as low as single-A .
Standard & Poor 's analyst David Lugg agrees .
`` That 's a boat-load of debt , '' he says .
Mr. Lugg notes that the borrowing could be lowered significantly if American Home divested Cyanamid 's agricultural chemical business .
But American Home Chairman John Stafford , in an interview yesterday , talked glowingly about the synergies between the research arm of Cyanamid 's chemical business and American Home 's own research division .
He said American Home has no immediate plans to shed any businesses .
Nevertheless , analysts say Mr. Stafford can always change his mind .
One of the first employees expected to leave American Cyanamid could be Albert J. Costello , the company 's chairman .
But `` that does n't mean he wo n't walk out of there a happy man , '' said John T.W. Hawkins , managing director of headhunting firm Russell Reynolds Associates .
Unlike other Cyanamid employees who will receive the pink slip , Mr. Costello will leave the company with a bundle .
He has options to buy 113,978 shares of Cyanamid at prices no lower than $ 52 a share , documents show .
At the takeover price of $ 101 a share , Mr. Costello would get at least $ 5.9 million assuming all the options became vested , as they typically do in a takeover .
He would also get double his most recent salary and bonus for a total of $ 1.7 million .
A spokeswoman for American Cyanamid could n't be reached to comment .
`` This is just the beginning , '' Mr. Hawkins said , saying that he expects more worker and executive displacement as the industry undergoes further consolidation .
`` People have to be keeping their options open ... You could be sitting in the catbird 's seat tomorrow and find yourself out on the street next week .
'' Investment bankers noted that American Home 's success in pulling off what began as a hostile acquisition is likely to lead to a flurry of other hostile takeover attempts in the health-care industry .
`` This is likely to be the beginning , rather than the end of hostile takeovers , '' said Alan Biloski , an investment banker with Wasserstein Perella & Co. , who notes there have already been at least two hostile takeover attempts this year for health-maintenance organizations .
Health-care companies have traditionally shied away from unfriendly takeovers .
One reason : Experience has shown they can fail .
In 1987 , Swiss drug giant F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. launched an unfriendly bid for Sterling Drug Inc. , but Sterling later found a white knight in Eastman Kodak Co. .
I am writing in response to your July 22 editorial `` Drug Unintelligence , '' which criticized the Clinton administration for suspending the sharing of counterdrug intelligence with Colombia and Peru .
The editorial portrays this action as a triumph of lawyers ' whims over good policy and claims it demonstrates the Clinton administration 's lack of commitment .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Your editorial fails to recognize that our radar and intelligence operations in Latin America have always been aimed at helping the host nation achieve legal arrests and drug seizures on the ground .
The Department of Defense suspended intelligence sharing with Colombia and Peru only after those countries indicated that , contrary to their previous policies , they would use U.S.-provided information to impose force against civilian aircraft in flight .
The Department of Justice , in conjunction with the legal counsels of numerous other U.S. government agencies , concluded that such activity could violate laws that were established to protect innocent individuals from terrorist attacks and to support commercial aviation .
U.S. law explicitly prohibits the destruction or damage of civilian aircraft in flight .
The change in the policies of Colombia and Peru raised a conflict between our established policy of ensuring maximum protection for civil aircraft and our strong interest in fighting drug trafficking .
Intelligence sharing has been suspended temporarily , pending a resolution that will allow us to provide real-time tracking data without risk of legal liability .
The president has asked Congress to create a narrow exception to existing criminal code provisions concerning the use of weapons against civilian aircraft in countries where such actions are necessary because of the threat posed by illicit drug trafficking and where there are appropriate procedures in place to protect innocent lives .
We will resume intelligence sharing as soon as legally possible .
On the larger questions your editorial raised about the administration 's commitment to fighting the drug problem , it might behoove you to examine the National Drug Control Strategy more closely .
The Clinton administration has asked Congress to appropriate $ 13.2 billion for federal counterdrug programs in fiscal year 1995 -- a 9 % increase over last year .
This would be the largest counterdrug budget in U.S. history .
The national strategy recognizes the importance of drug education , prevention and treatment programs .
At the same time , it calls for initiatives to improve counterdrug law enforcement , putting 100,000 new police on our streets and shifting international efforts toward the cocaine source nations where we can most efficiently prevent this poison from ever reaching the U.S. I particularly take issue with your assertion that the suspension of intelligence sharing is a sign of a general reluctance on the part of the Pentagon to be involved in counterdrug efforts .
The defense department 's budgeting and dedication of personnel and assets reflect a very high level of commitment to the National Drug Control Strategy .
The department will spend more than $ 850 million on counterdrug efforts this year , including approximately $ 150 million worth of support in the source nations of Colombia , Peru and Bolivia .
Additional initiatives include a $ 45 million radar tracker aircraft program and the use of an over-the-horizon radar to monitor drug trafficking in South America .
Neither the defense department , nor any other single government agency , will be able to solve our nation 's illegal drug problem quickly .
The president 's National Drug Control Strategy offers an integrated approach that addresses the problem from a variety of angles simultaneously , and those of us involved in implementing that strategy are committed to doing so as effectively as possible .
As a journalist , I 've always appreciated your sure instinct for an interesting feature story .
But the extraordinarily touching page-one article July 27 , `` Sisterly Love : Seven Women , Sharing Secrets for Fifty Years , Remain ` The Dreamers ' , '' by Clare Ansberry , wowed even this veteran subscriber .
You deserve praise for the spare , clean writing and for having devoted so much space to a story that , on the face of it , had little to do with business or politics .
But , then again , the 50 years of the `` Dreamers '' lives in Lorain , Ohio , have everything to do with the evolution of this country .
And revealing that in what at first seems to be a simple , charming story , is the genius of the article .
I want to share many thoughts and sentiments with you about your fine article .
This is difficult for me to do because I ca n't stop crying .
What a marvelous , touching , heartwarming story , in which I see a reflection of my own family history and friends .
Thank you very much for putting this article in front of your readers .
NEW YORK -- International Business Machines Corp. has waded into the health-care debate , asking 105,000 U.S. employees to urge their congressmen and senators to make changes in how two Democratic proposals would affect company health plans .
IBM , which had largely supported the goals and approach of the original Clinton administration plan , sent electronic mail to its employees on July 26 outlining its concerns over the newer bills of Sen. George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- and Rep. Richard Gephardt -LRB- D. , Mo. -RRB- .
On Monday , IBM sent out another `` e-mail , '' asking employees to contact their representatives if they agreed with the company and suggesting a note describing their personal concerns .
This marks the first time that IBM has actively urged employees to essentially lobby on a political issue .
`` We want a health-care reform bill passed , '' an IBM spokesman in Washington said , but `` we want to make sure it does n't tear down a part of the health-care system that now works very well .
'' IBM 's main concern is that the two bills would hurt its ability to offer a cover-all benefits plan to U.S. employees .
Currently , the company 's plan covers 600,000 people , including family dependents , but the new proposals could reduce that pool and thereby increase the cost , according to IBM .
ERISA , or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act , currently allows a company with employees in many states to sidestep individual state requirements for how benefits are paid if the company meets federal standards .
But the Mitchell and Gephardt bills leave out the ERISA exemption from state requirements , and may allow states to eliminate company health plans and compel employees to be part of a state program .

Four California state agencies are conducting investigations of state officials who were paid or hired by Tandem Computers Inc. after they reviewed Tandem 's performance as the main vendor of a $ 49.7 million computer system for the state Department of Motor Vehicles .
Until now , Tandem 's five-year effort to upgrade the DMV 's bug-ridden computer system has been merely embarrassing -- a story of how a high-technology company failed to deliver on its promises to modernize a massive database .
Tandem has defended itself by pointing out that it was only responsible for delivering the computers and operating system , which it says worked .
The state was responsible for providing the software to run the hardware , but it never did , Tandem says .
The DMV contract was terminated this year .
But the state 's investigations of possible improper payoffs to its officials raise new questions about Tandem 's role in the contract .
On Wednesday , California 's state auditor issued a report concluding that state officials approved cost overruns on the project even after it was apparent that the project was n't working .
Some of these officials later worked for Tandem or for a company that consulted for Tandem .
Tandem , a Cupertino , Calif. , computer maker , said it is n't the object of the investigations .
`` Tandem has done not one thing illegal , '' James Treybig , president and chief executive officer , said in an interview .
Tandem said it did hire , and pay consulting fees to , state officials involved with the contract .
But `` all of our relationships with these individuals was open , appropriate , legal and ethical , '' the company said in a statement .
Separately , the state 's auditor , Kurt Sjoberg , said he asked the State Attorney General 's office to examine whether Tandem helped state officials falsify a $ 46,000 purchase order submitted as part of the contract , in violation of the state 's penal and public-contract code .
Tandem said it had no part in the falsifying of the purchase order , for which four DMV employees have already been disciplined .
The order was written on Tandem stationery , but Tandem said it was n't printed by computer , as its other purchase orders are .
`` Our belief is that it was not generated by Tandem , '' Josie Parry , Tandem 's general counsel , said in an interview .
The officials under investigation for possible conflicts of interest stemming from their relationships with Tandem include Steven Kolodney , a former director of the state 's Office of Information Technology ; David Lema , a former director of the Teale Data Center , which crunches numbers for state agencies ; and Dennis Walker , a DMV official who was in charge of the computer upgrade .
One of Mr. Kolodney 's jobs as head of OIT was to oversee spending on computer projects , which included approving budgets and cost overruns on the Tandem project .
He headed the office from March 1983 through September 1989 , and again from April 1991 through April 1994 .
Tandem 's contract ran from 1989 until early April ; Tandem began bidding on the contract in 1988 .
In 1989 , Mr. Kolodney resigned to form a nonprofit technology-consulting firm with Mr. Lema , who had just resigned as director of the Teale Data Center .
According to Tandem and state officials , the new firm , Government Technology Group , received two contracts from Tandem in 1990 totaling $ 200,000 .
Under the first contract , for $ 150,000 , the firm agreed to develop ways for Tandem to sell its computers to state agencies in six other states , Tandem said .
Under the second contract , for $ 50,000 , Mr. Kolodney helped prepare a report for the DMV project , Tandem and state officials said .
Reached at home in Sacramento , Calif. , Mr. Kolodney declined to comment .
Mr. Lema , who now heads D.R. Lema & Associates in Elk Grove , Calif. , said he was n't personally involved in choosing Tandem for the contract , although his agency did help the DMV test Tandem equipment .
`` I was not paid by Tandem or anybody else , for any job or decision made at DMV .
'' he said .
Choosing Tandem for the contract `` was not my decision to make , '' he added .
Mr. Walker was hired by Tandem in October 1990 from the DMV , where he had been head of the computer upgrade project until February 1989 .
-LRB- When Tandem hired him , he was chief of the headquarters operation division , which was n't in charge of overseeing the project .
-RRB- Tandem paid him an $ 85,000 salary , plus a $ 14,000 hiring bonus , to head the company 's part of the DMV upgrade project .
Mr. Treybig said Tandem hired Mr. Walker because the Department of Motor Vehicles required the company to hire someone with experience with the DMV .
Mr. Walker , who now works for the state 's Department of Social Services , said `` I have n't done anything to violate any criminal statutes , or anything unethical or immoral '' by working for Tandem after working for DMV .
The state agencies conducting the investigations are the District Attorney 's office , the Attorney General 's office , the Fair Political Practices Commission and the Bureau of State Audits .
In addition to the report released yesterday , the Bureau of State Audits said it will issue a separate report before the end of the year concerning possible conflicts of interest involving Mr. Kolodney and others .
Clark Refining & Marketing Inc. said it agreed to buy Chevron Corp. 's refinery in Port Arthur , Texas , for $ 74 million , more than doubling Clark 's refining capacity .
Clark , a St. Louis subsidiary of Toronto 's Horsham Corp. , said it also will pay Chevron $ 140 million for inventory at the site .
Clark also could owe San Francisco-based Chevron as much as $ 125 million over the next five years under the agreement , if refining industry margins rise .
The purchase is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter .
Clark has current refining capacity of 140,000 barrels a day at two plants in the Midwest .
It also owns 820 gasoline stations in 12 states .
Clark said it is interested in acquiring additional retail outlets to market its added output from the Port Arthur plant .
Townsley distributes men 's and boy 's wear under several brand names , including Sasson , Pony and Coleman .
Ira Weissman , chief operating officer of Stage II , said the price , still being negotiated , is expected to be around $ 7 million in cash , stock and deferred payments .
Townsley 's founder , Stu Goldman , will be named president of Stage II ; the company 's chairman , Jack Clark , also will be active in the combined company .
The acquisition is scheduled to close by the end of September .
Varlen Corp. said it completed the purchase of Acieries de Ploermel , a steel foundry in the Brittany region of France .
Acieries de Ploermel , which has annual revenue of about $ 9 million , specializes in railroad products .
Varlen , whose Keystone Railway Equipment unit makes railcar cushioning devices , said it will initially make an equity investment and provide loan guarantees that together total $ 1.1 million .
Varlen , Naperville , Ill. , said over time it will inject working capital , refinance debt , and use local and French government grants and interest-free loans .
Varlen said the purchase provides a `` beachhead '' for the sale of Keystone products in Europe .
Escagenetics Corp. , San Carlos , Calif. , said it has been issued a patent on genetically engineered coffee .
The patent covers genetically modified cells of one widely used species of coffee , known as C. arabica , and the process by which plants and beans can be produced from them .
The company said the process would make it possible to introduce genetic material that would alter caffeine content , improve pest resistence and retention of beans on coffee plants .
Ahman Hakim-Elahi , Escagenetics 's general counsel , said it wo n't produce genetically engineered coffee itself .
It expects to collaborate with other companies or license the technology to others , he said .
LOS ANGELES -- Neutrogena Corp. , which is in talks about being acquired but has n't identified the suitor as American or foreign , said the president of its Neutrogena Europe unit `` is leaving the company .
'' The maker of skin and beauty-care products announced the departure of Daniel Lapouyade , 51 years old , after trading closed .
Neutrogena shares , which traded at about $ 22 before it disclosed the talks with a possible buyer Aug. 9 , yesterday closed at $ 28.625 , up $ 1.125 , in Nasdaq Stock Market trading .
His departure increases speculation that Neutrogena chairman and controlling shareholder Lloyd E. Cotsen favors a foreign buyer for the company .
Mr. Cotsen controls 39 % of the company .
Among the companies suggested as possible suitors are Unilever NV of the Netherlands , and U.S. giants Procter & Gamble Co. , Colgate-Palmolive Co. , Johnson & Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. .
All would qualify as `` substantially larger '' than Neutrogena , the only description the company has used for the company that is talking with it .
Neutrogena said Christian Bardin , 55 , president of the company 's international division , would assume Mr. Lapouyade 's duties temporarily .
It did n't discuss the plans of Mr. Lapouyade , who is based in France and could n't be reached late yesterday .
KALININGRAD -- Since the collapse of the Soviet Union , inhabitants of this patch of Russia the size of Connecticut have been cut off from the rest of their republic .
Hundreds of miles of independent Lithuania and Belarus now lie between the 900,000 people here and their fellow Russians .
Still , the locals are taking the separation philosophically .
Very philosophically .
Instead of bewailing the loss of Mother Russia , they have become smitten with the German philosopher Immanuel Kant , who lived here .
`` Kant is eternal , '' exclaims Valentina Pocladova , deputy director of the History and Art Museum in Kaliningrad , which is the name of this city as well as of the surrounding oblast , or territory .
She says , with rapturous enthusiasm , that the 18th-century thinker and author of `` The Critique of Pure Reason '' `` is very close to me , but we always discover him anew .
'' She meets regularly , she says , with a group of Kant enthusiasts to discuss his teachings .
And next month she will fulfill a longtime dream by holding an exhibition with a Kant theme , for which works by artists in 26 countries have been solicited .
`` Artists Honor Kant , '' a show at another institution , the city art gallery , opened last month .
An international Kant society is now based here , and a new Kant museum is on the drawing board .
A biweekly newspaper ran an article on some aspect or other of Kantian philosophy in virtually every issue for two years until it folded earlier this year .
`` Our schoolchildren learn Kant , '' explains a proud Irina Kuznetsova , the territory 's top official for education and welfare .
`` It 's not just the categorical imperative , '' she adds , referring to the most famous Kantian concept , a kind of secularized version of the golden rule .
Youngsters , she says , learn `` all the problems of Kant 's ethics .
'' Ms. Kuznetsova , who teaches Kant at Kaliningrad University , contends the children 's curriculum is unique .
`` Germany , '' she says , contemptuously , `` has no such courses .
'' Why have Russians turned an austere , almost unreadable German thinker into a local hero ?
History has a lot to do with it .
Kant 's roots are deep here : Born in 1724 , the philosopher lived his entire life -- nearly 80 long years -- in this city , then known as Koenigsberg .
He never ventured outside the province .
His Russian admirers have no natural tie to that past .
Russians have lived in these parts only since 1945 .
That was when the Red Army overran the Nazi forces defending East Prussia , as this erstwhile easternmost German province was known for centuries .
The German population was expelled by Stalin by the end of 1948 , and Kaliningrad -- the new name for city and province -- got a total population transplant .
Tens of thousands of Soviets , many from the gulag labor camps , were forcibly settled in the rubble that remained after the war .
Throughout the Communist period , the fact that the city had been Kant 's home was never suppressed , but it was also never celebrated .
However , when the territory was cut free geographically in 1990 and 1991 -- losing most of its ideological baggage as well -- people here began looking for a history they could feel good about .
They cast their eyes well into the past .
`` Cultural phenomena like Kant are concrete points of contact in this land .
They become part of our self-consciousness , '' says Prof. Vladimir Gilmanov , who teaches philology at the university .
He has been tracking changes in Kaliningraders ' identity that he calls `` unexpected , really incomprehensible .
'' He adds : `` Lots of kids , rock fans , pop-culture fans visit Kant 's grave , '' a small , perpetually flower-strewn shrine adjoining the city 's cathedral .
Ruined during the war , the cathedral is now under reconstruction by the government , with some private contributions , despite the city 's post-Soviet poverty .
Eventually , the authorities would like to install a permanent Kant museum in the Gothic brick building , on which construction began in 1333 .
This turn to the German past , adds Prof. Gilmanov , grows out of feelings of revulsion for Soviet culture .
Kant , who put great emphasis on the importance of free will , is a compelling alternative .
This year , the university will stage a Russo-German celebration of the 450th anniversary of its founding .
At the same time , it will commemorate Kant 's 270th birthday .
The rage for things Kantian even surprises itinerant Germans , like F.W. Christians , who have played a part in reviving the memory of the philosopher .
Mr. Christians , who is chairman of the supervisory board of Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt and fought for Germany here in World War II , helped arrange for a statue of Kant to be installed at the university , a replica of one that stood until 1945 .
A frequent visitor to Kaliningrad , Mr. Christians says he is amazed that the statue has become so important to people here .
`` This monument has raised their sense of self .
Young Russians , ones who are n't even at the university , stand there and are proud of the German historic past and this German philosopher .
'' The love affair with things German does n't end with Kant .
A majority of Kaliningraders wanted to restore the old name , Koenigsberg , according to Wolf Dolgikh , editor of the newspaper , the Koenigsberg Courier , that promoted the Kant fancy .
The territory 's political leaders killed the debate when Russian war veterans strenuously opposed the idea , but `` it 's only a matter of time , '' Mr. Dolgikh says .
German has eclipsed English as the most popular foreign language in schools , and language courses for businesspeople are oversubscribed .
Many , indeed , attribute the Teutomania to a widespread hope that German investment will help revive the region , which would like to become a Baltic free-trade entrepot .
Whether the money comes today or in a decade , plenty of Russians believe that geography is destiny .
After all , Kaliningrad is closer to Berlin than to Moscow .
`` In five years , maybe 10 , this will all be Germany , '' predicts one Russian who works as a quartermaster in the city 's ailing fishing fleet .
Ultimately , though , Kaliningraders such as the museum 's Ms. Pocladova believe that more than economics is at work .
`` A new ethos is being created here , '' she says .
`` The Russian influence is weak .
We look up and we see Gothic , we see German buildings .
'' When they do come , Germans are often shocked at just how far the Kaliningrad Russians have gone in appropriating the German past .
But it seems unremarkable to locals .
Asked why she cares about a past that has nothing to do with her ancestors , a young museum guide at the new Prussian museum in the Russian naval officers ' club gives an uncomprehending look .
`` This is our tradition , too , '' she says , `` and we want to continue it .
'' LONDON -- You have the right to remain silent .
Well , you did have the right to remain silent .
In Britain , the government is about to change that .
Yesterday , the U.K. Home Office issued a new list of guidelines for the police as part of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill , which John Major 's Conservative government expects to pass this fall .
Among other things , it offers a rewording of the caution read to suspects , effectively demolishing the right to remain silent .
The government says its rewording `` permits inferences to be drawn from a suspect 's silence .
'' But critics of the change say that by allowing the defendant 's silence to be used against him or her in court , it undermines the principle that a suspect is presumed innocent until proved guilty .
Unveiled as part of a `` major statement of the rights of the individual and powers of the police '' by Home Secretary Michael Howard , the guidelines also declared that police no longer need to have `` reasonable suspicion '' to search people or vehicles if they suspect terrorism or fear violence .
Tampering with such legal hallmarks as the right to silence and protection against unreasonable searches would be unthinkable in the U.S. , where such rights are enshrined in the Bill of Rights .
And the Supreme Court 's famous 1965 Miranda decision on the right to remain silent and have an attorney present for questioning still holds sway .
But this is the U.K. , and there are n't any Miranda rights .
There is n't even a Bill of Rights , or a written Constitution for that matter .
A government majority can , in theory , change the law whenever it wishes to do away with free speech , free press , peaceful assembly or the right to bear arms .
Liberty , the British human-rights organization , was uncivil in its response to the new guidelines .
By attaching guilt to silence , it said , the government 's action `` heralds the end to the right to silence .
'' Liberty , which plans to challenge the guidelines before the European Court of Human Rights , says the changes make the case for Britain to have its own Bill of Rights .
A spokesman for the government said he did n't understand all of the fuss .
`` We are n't abolishing the right of silence , but a court will be allowed to draw an inference , '' he said .
Previously , a person arrested in Britain would be told by police , `` You do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so , but what you say may be given in evidence .
'' Under the new guidelines , police would instead offer this long-winded version : `` You do not have to say anything .
But if you do not mention now something which you later use in your defense , the court may decide that your failure to mention it now strengthens the case against you .
A record will be made of anything you say , and it may be given in evidence if you are brought to trial .
'' WASHINGTON -- Treasury General Counsel Jean Hanson said she is resigning and will return to the New York law firm at which she was a partner before coming to Washington last year .
Ms. Hanson 's resignation yesterday , like that of Deputy Secretary Roger Altman a day earlier , came in the wake of congressional criticism of contacts between the Treasury and the White House over a criminal investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan , a failed Arkansas thrift tied to the Whitewater affair .
Ms. Hanson participated in many of those contacts .
In addition , she was rebuked during recent congressional Whitewater hearings for not immediately correcting Mr. Altman 's testimony earlier this year about the contacts .
Ms. Hanson 's version of events differed markedly from that of Mr. Altman and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on some key points .
Mr. Bentsen recommended that his executive secretary and senior adviser , Edward Knight , take Ms. Hanson 's place as the Treasury 's top lawyer .
The 43-year-old Mr. Knight is the antithesis of Ms. Hanson in that he is an old Washington hand , having worked for Mr. Bentsen in the Senate and then as a lobbyist with the Washington law firm Akin , Gump , Strauss , Hauer & Feld , where his clients included Upjohn Co. , Warner-Lambert Co. and the National Football League .
In 1988 , Mr. Knight was Mr. Bentsen 's executive assistant when he was the Democratic vice presidential nominee .
At the Treasury , Mr. Knight played a major role in coordinating efforts by the administration and the business community to push for congressional passage of the world-trade pact reached under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
Mr. Knight is said to have well-developed political radar and to have desired the general counsel slot for some time .
Ms. Hanson , 44 , had been a partner with the New York law firm Fried , Frank , Harris , Shriver & Jacobson .
In other Whitewater developments , the House Banking Committee 's ranking Republican , James Leach of Iowa , lost his Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to obtain documents relating to Madison Guaranty from the Resolution Trust Corp. and the Office of Thrift Supervision .
The agencies released more than 8,000 pages , but withheld some material .
While it is more difficult for agencies to withhold documents from Congress than from others , federal district Judge Charles Richey said that Rep. Leach was acting on his own , and not as a member of Congress .
Separately , 40 Democratic members of Congress wrote to federal appeals court Judge David Sentelle , the head of the panel that recently named Kenneth Starr to be Whitewater independent counsel .
The letter asked that the panel members reconsider their decision and either tell Mr. Starr to step down or issue a supplementary opinion explaining why they believe Mr. Starr will act independently .
`` Mr. Starr 's own partisan political activities create at least an appearance that he lacks the independence necessary '' for the job , and Judge Sentelle 's meeting with two Republican Senate critics of the president create another appearance problem , the letter said .
Also yesterday , John Ryan , the RTC 's acting chief , defended the agency 's decision to put Jean Lewis , the RTC investigator who had been primarily responsible for the Madison criminal inquiry , on administrative leave , along with two others in the agency 's office in Kansas City , Mo. .
In response to a letter from Rep. Peter King -LRB- R. , N.Y. -RRB- , Mr. Ryan wrote that the three officials were placed on leave with pay for two weeks `` while an informal fact-finding investigation into possible serious breaches of RTC policies and procedures is conducted .
'' The action was taken , he added , `` in the face of reports that the critical work of the RTC was being adversely affected in that office .
'' NEW YORK -- Worrisome news on inflation and a falling dollar sent bond prices into a tailspin .
Over the past two trading sessions , the bond market has given up most of the gains it registered Tuesday when the Federal Reserve moved aggressively against inflation by boosting short-term interest rates 1\/2 percentage point .
The price declines came partly in response to sharp increases in the inflation categories of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve 's August Business Outlook Survey released yesterday .
Bond investors fear inflation because it reduces the value of investments with a fixed rate of return .
`` The indications for future inflation just keep getting worse , '' said Louis Crandall , chief economist at R.H. Wrightson & Associates , Inc. in New York , a firm providing economic analysis .
A sharp drop in the value of the dollar vs. the yen also depressed bond prices .
The dollar plunged to 98.57 yen from 100.21 yen late Wednesday in reaction to new concerns over the outlook for U.S.-Japan trade talks .
A weak dollar poses two problems for bondholders .
It raises inflation fears because it increases the cost of imported goods , and it diminishes the attractiveness , especially to foreign investors , of dollar-denominated assets such as Treasury securities .
The ominous inflation news , analysts said , confirmed the need for the Fed to boost the short-term interest rate .
And the market 's poor performance validated hesitation voiced by many portfolio managers about aggressively buying Treasurys in the wake of that Fed tightening .
The bottom line , market watchers said , is that there 's a continuing risk in the bond market of plummeting prices and surging yields .
`` We 've got a good economic expansion going , and in that environment , it 's going to be very difficult for the bond market to rally , '' said Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Securities Inc. .
Meanwhile , investors snapped up $ 1 billion of credit-card asset-backed securities in two offerings by the First Chicago Corp. .
National Bank .
Prices of Denver International Airport bonds dropped more than two points in response to a maelstrom of bad news .
The bad news included reports of criticisms of the condition of the airport 's runways , plans by one major airline to cut its Denver service , and complaints from another major airline about a second slower baggage system to substitute temporarily for the original problem-plagued system .
Meanwhile , major European bond markets were mixed after a jittery trading session .
Among 10-year benchmark government bonds , the price of the 6.75 % coupon German bund due 2004 rose 0.06 by late yesterday in Europe to 96.84 .
It yielded 7.20 % , down from 7.21 % on Wednesday .
The price of the 6.75 % coupon British gilt maturing in 2004 dropped 22\/32 to 87 2\/32 to yield 8.66 % , up from 8.55 % .
And the price of the 5.50 % coupon French treasury note maturing in 2004 dropped 0.80 to 92.40 to yield 7.86 % , up from 7.74 % .
In the U.S. market , bond prices began falling early , continuing declines that began Wednesday after the post-Fed tightening rally ran out of steam .
Yesterday 's early losses then were extended in response to sharp increases in the inflation categories of the Philadelphia Fed report .
The index for prices paid rose to 48.4 in August from 36.4 in July while the prices-received index jumped to 24.5 in August from 15.8 .
The overall-business-activity index registered 13.9 in August , up from 11.3 in July .
Analysts said the report flashed an important warning signal on inflation .
`` The report is telling us the price pressures are broadening and are beginning to build in intensity , '' said John Ryding , senior economist at Bear , Stearns & Co. .
Mr. Ryding called the increase in the two indexes `` significant acceleration .
'' The Philadelphia Fed report followed other problematic economic news for the bond market .
The Labor Department reported initial claims for unemployment insurance edged up 3,000 in the week ended Saturday to 327,000 .
Analysts said that level of jobless claims is consistent with another solid month of payroll gains .
The August employment report is due to be released Sept. 2 , the Friday before Labor Day weekend .
On the trade front , the Commerce Department announced the trade deficit clocked in at $ 9.37 billion for June , down slightly from May .
But analysts focused on the export data within the trade report , which suggested activity in that sector is gaining steam .
Exports of goods and services rose 3.6 % in June to a record $ 58.17 billion .
Analysts said the day 's data served as a reminder that while the Fed is n't likely to raise rates again until much later this year , additional tightening is in the cards .
`` This was n't the last tightening from the Fed we will be seeing , '' said Mr. Moran at Daiwa .
`` We 'll be seeing more through the balance of the year and into 1996 .
'' The weakness of the dollar added to the negative sentiment in the bond markets yesterday .
`` A lot of the difficulties the market experienced were due to the dollar , '' said Matthew Alexy , government bond market strategist at CS First Boston Inc. `` And the bond market gets very skittish when the dollar is the cause behind the move .
'' Compounding the market 's problems , bond traders face another round of issuance .
The Treasury Department is gearing up to sell $ 17.25 billion in two-year notes Tuesday and $ 11 billion of five-year Wednesday .
In when-issued trading late yesterday , the two-year note yielded 6.30 % , and the five-year note yielded 6.95 % .
Traders said the inability of the bond market to sustain the Tuesday 's price gains reflected caution by investors .
While bondholders were comforted by the Fed 's rate increases , many saw little reason to buy aggressively until there is evidence that the economy is slowing .
`` We 're not making big bets , but we 're not as defensive as we were three months ago or even one month ago , '' said Eric Cheung , a portfolio manager at Wilmington Trust Co. in Wilmington , Del. `` But we do n't want to take the next step until we see more economic news .
'' While the market 's volatility has scared off many potential buyers , bond prices actually have been confined to well-defined ranges over the past few months .
For that reason , Mr. Cheung said he expects the bond market to recover from yesterday 's swoon .
`` It 's a tug-of-war within a trading range , '' he said .
`` I would n't be surprised to see the market pick up again in the next couple of days .
'' Meanwhile yesterday , the Treasury sold $ 16.79 billion of one-year bills .
Here are details from that offering : Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it .
The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year .
The bills are dated Aug. 25 and mature Aug. 24 , 1995 .
Mortgage-backed securities closed 1\/2 to 3\/4 points lower , tracking the slide in the Treasury prices .
First Chicago sold $ 1 billion of credit-card asset-backed securities in two offerings : a $ 500 million issue of floating-rate securities led by Salomon Brothers Inc. and a $ 500 million issue of fixed-rate securities led by First Chicago Capital Markets .
The fixed-rate securities were easily absorbed , given the relative lack of fixed-rate credit-card securities in the market .
A trader said the floaters also were well bid , a trend he expects will continue until the market takes on a bullish tone .
Floaters often are preferred by investors who believe rates are going to rise , as the coupon on floating-rate securities rises , or falls , with the market .
`` Until you have a consensus we 're in a bull market , that rates are going to decline and not rise , you will have continued demand for floaters , '' the trader said .
`` It 's a defensive investment and it 's a little better than cash .
'' A drop-off in Denver airport bonds capped a morose day in the municipal market , as tax-exempt bonds ended down about a point .
With the market dragged lower by Treasurys -- muni holders began taking profits on this week 's gains .
But sliding most notably was Denver airport paper , which had been holding up well despite a string of bad news this month .
The huge airport 's automated baggage system still refuses to work , and the city last week decided to spend $ 25 million on a conveyer-belt system to move baggage so the four-times-delayed facility could open .
United Airlines , set to be the new airport 's largest customer , has been vocal about its dissatisfaction with that second system , and Continental Airlines announced Wednesday it would cut its flights from Denver to four cities , compared with the current 26 .
And early yesterday , a soil expert was quoted by a news service as saying the airport 's runways would need to be dug up because of shifting earth below .
It was all too much for Denver airport bonds , which have `` been teetering for a while now , '' said one trader in Denver .
Yesterday they fell , with yields ending up about 25 basis points on most maturities .
Yields on the Denver Airport 6 3\/4 of 2022 were around 7.97 % late in the day , compared with 7.75 % late Wednesday .
The decline took place as Denver prepares to offer around $ 225 million of new bonds the last week in August .
The soil questions that seem to have set off yesterday 's rout are nothing new .
Ernie Perez , who follows the Denver airport for Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group , said the ratings agency had long known about the problem , had asked Denver officials about it directly , and were n't enormously concerned .
The National Bank of Canada and Lehman Brothers Inc. tapped the corporate market as other issuers remained sidelined by sinking Treasury prices .
The National Bank of Canada , a commerical and personal-service bank based in Montreal , sold $ 250 million of 10-year subordinated notes after increasing the size of its issue by $ 50 million to meet investor demand , said a syndicate official at lead manager Goldman , Sachs & Co. .
The 8.125 % coupon subordinated notes were priced at 99.982 to yield 8.127 % .
Lehman Brothers , a New York investment bank and unit of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , sold $ 150 million of 7.375 % coupon senior subordinated notes at 99.87 to yield 7.423 % in a self-lead-managed issue .
In the secondary market , attention again was focused on the bonds of Viacom Inc. as reports of higher-than-expected bids for its Madison Square Garden properties circulated .
Viacom is selling the New York arena to cut some of its $ 10 billion of debt from its Paramount Communications Inc. takeover .
Viacom 's 8 % exchangable coupon 12-year debentures rose more than 1 1\/4 point , or $ 12.50 for a bond with a $ 1,000 face value to 78.75 , a trader said .
The yield dropped to 11.43 % from 11.52 % .
Otherwise , trading activity remained thin , market participants said .
Junk-bond prices dropped by more than 1\/4 point while investment-grade prices fell in sympathy with Treasurys .
Meanwhile , the Basque Country , an autonomous region in northern Spain , filed its first Yankee-bond offering this week , naming Merrill Lynch & Co. as underwriter .
Timing is uncertain on the $ 125 million issue , but prospectuses should be available in early September , a Merrill spokeswoman said .

ATLANTA -- AmeriHealth Inc. and Champion Healthcare Corp. said they agreed to merge in a tax-free stock swap .
But the pact came under fire late yesterday from a group of AmeriHealth shareholders who called for replacing a majority of the company 's directors .
Under the agreement , which must be approved by shareholders of both companies , the surviving company -- Champion Healthcare -- will issue shares of common and preferred stock to current holders of AmeriHealth and Champion stock .
Executives at AmeriHealth , a hospital owner and manager , said they were unable to estimate the value of the transaction , which is expected to close in October .
Champion , based in Houston , is a closely held owner and operator of hospitals .
In trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange , AmeriHealth closed at 87.5 cents a share , down 6.25 cents , or 6.7 % .
The new company would have more than $ 150 million in assets and would own and operate six health-care facilities in four states .
The investor group that challenged the transaction -- headed by Thomas M. Clarke , president of Pittsfield , Mass.-based Lenox Healthcare Inc. , an institutional holder -- has a 13.1 % stake in AmeriHealth .
Mr. Clarke , in a letter to AmeriHealth , said : `` We have serious doubts that this transaction does anything other than enable a private company owning three health care assets with no public track record to go public using AmeriHealth as its vehicle to do so .
'' Mr. Clarke said the investors would propose a slate of new , independent directors for the AmeriHealth board .
Newell Co. said it agreed to acquire Home Fashions Inc. , a Westminster , Calif. , maker of window coverings , including vertical blinds and pleated shades .
Terms were n't disclosed .
The Freeport , Ill. , maker of consumer products said Home Fashions had sales of $ 140 million in 1993 .
The transaction is expected to close by Sept. .
Newell also said the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act has ended in connection with its pending acquisition of Faber-Castell Corp. The transaction is still subject to the completion of the contract and Faber-Castell shareholders ' approval .
It is expected to close in early to mid-fourth quarter .
LAS VEGAS -- Mirage Resorts Inc. scrapped a planned spinoff of its original Golden Nugget casino in downtown Las Vegas and another casino in Laughlin , citing a sharp decline in gambling stocks since the plan was proposed last fall .
The casino operator had planned to create a separate company that would specialize in smaller casino projects .
The spinoff also would have included two sites in Atlantic City , N.J. , zoned for casino development .
Daniel Lee , chief financial officer , said that when the spinoff was proposed last fall Mirage thought the move would enhance its ability to compete for larger projects and its access to capital .
Since then , he said , Mirage has focused on several promising potential sites near major metropolitan areas , and has secured a large bank line of credit .
Investors reacted favorably to the news , pushing Mirage 's stock up 87.5 cents to $ 19.50 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
`` At the time the deal was proposed , small-cap gambling stocks were much higher , and Mirage was trading at a premium , '' said Bruce Turner , an analyst with Salomon Bros. `` Now , small caps are at a distinct discount , so a spinoff does n't make much sense .
'' Last year , Mirage canceled an exchange offer for the 12.75 % unsecured notes of its GNLV Finance Corp. subsidiary when investors balked at accepting as much as $ 112.9 million principal amount of new 9.25 % senior subordinated notes .
GNLV Finance is a financing subsidiary affiliated with the downtown Golden Nugget casino .
NOVA Corp. debentures were converted into stock by the government of Alberta .
The government said it converted 150 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 109 million -RRB- of the debentures into 14 million common shares of Nova at a conversion price of C$ 10.70 a share .
The Alberta government , through its Alberta Heritage Trust Fund , said it sold six million of the new shares in the open market for C$ 78.7 million , or C$ 13.12 a share .
Nova , based in Calgary , Alberta , closed yesterday at C$ 13 a share , off 12.5 Canadian cents , on the Toronto Stock Exchange .
Nova , a gas-pipeline and chemicals concern , now has about 477 million shares outstanding .
Seth Glickenhaus , an 80-year-old New York money manager , has one of the best stock-picking records around .
Among 459 money managers ranked by CDA Investment Technologies for the three years ended June 30 , Glickenhaus & Co. ranks first in estimated stock-picking results , with a compound annual return for the period of 31 % .
The firm is also among the leaders for the most recent five years .
Among its hits have been Chrysler , Travelers -LRB- formerly Primerica -RRB- and Federal National Mortgage Association .
`` We like to find things that are out of favor , '' says Mr. Glickenhaus , the firm 's chief investment officer .
`` We do n't play musical chairs with something that 's been in favor , '' even though the stock may still go higher .
`` If we did n't catch it early on , we 're not interested .
'' These days , two of Mr. Glickenhaus 's three favorite stocks , Chrysler and Countrywide Credit Industries , are slightly out-of-favor largely because of this year 's rise in interest rates .
The third , ICN Pharmaceuticals , is a highly controversial stock scorned by many money managers .
Chrysler roared from 10 in 1991 to 63 1\/2 early this year , with Mr. Glickenhaus along for much of the ride .
Yesterday it slipped 1 1\/8 to 47 1\/4 , just six times the past 12 months ' earnings .
The low price\/earnings ratio suggests that many investors doubt Chrysler can keep up its recent success .
`` People do n't appreciate that this is the premier auto company in the world today in many respects , '' Mr. Glickenhaus says .
He praises Chrysler 's low production costs , its ability to bring out new models in just two and a half years , the roomy design of its LH cars , and the popularity of its Jeeps , minivans and Neons .
What 's more , Chrysler 's `` debt is down to about 19 % of capital , and by the end of this year they should eliminate the big criticism about their unfunded pension liability , '' he says .
Sure , the car companies have had `` two years of very good business , '' Mr. Glickenhaus says .
But he figures that 's no reason to bail out : `` Auto cycles are generally five-year cycles .
'' Countrywide Credit , a Pasadena , Calif. , mortgage company , is Mr. Glickenhaus 's second favorite .
The stock is way down this year , having fallen from a 52-week high of 23 1\/4 to close yesterday at 14 1\/4 , as mortgage refinancings have dried up with rising interest rates .
Countrywide 's weak showing is one reason Glickenhaus & Co. has only a middle-of-the-pack stock-picking performance for the past 12 months , up 1.4 % by CDA 's estimate .
But Mr. Glickenhaus argues that Countrywide stock is an even better bargain , now that it 's languishing at a mere eight times earnings .
`` I ` ve broken 22 lances '' defending Countrywide 's merits , he says .
`` People think , this poor man , he 's so misguided .
'' Mr. Glickenhaus says he thinks the worst of the interest-rate shocks are past .
And he notes that Countrywide not only originates mortgages but has a huge mortgage-servicing business that should be relatively steady .
He praises David Loeb and Angelo Mozilo , the firm 's top executives .
He quips that Mr. Mozilo started `` with a great advantage -- he was the son of a Bronx butcher .
'' Their achievement in bringing Countrywide into the big leagues of mortgage finance , he says , is `` with the possible exception of William Gates of Microsoft , the greatest achievement of our financial world -- totally unrecognized and unrewarded .
'' Mr. Glickenhaus 's third-favorite stock is his most controversial .
It 's ICN Pharmaceuticals , a Costa Mesa , Calif. , drug company .
ICN has reported losses of late .
Its chairman , Milan Panic , has been heavily involved in politics in war-torn Yugoslavia .
And the company has been heavily criticized going back to the mid-1980s for excessively bullish comments about the promise of its drugs in treating viral illnesses such as AIDS .
Mr. Glickenhaus says that Mr. Panic is `` dictatorial beyond belief , volatile , and hyperbolic , '' as well as overpaid .
Nevertheless , Mr. Glickenhaus says he believes one of ICN 's drugs will prove highly useful in treating symptoms of Hepatitis C , a strain of hepatitis that affects millions of people world-wide .
In addition , he says Mr. Panic 's strategy of `` building up outlets for drug distribution in the iron curtain countries and in Russia proper '' is a wise long-term strategy .
According to Technimetrics , other big Glickenhaus holdings as of March 31 included Chase Manhattan -LRB- $ 51 million -RRB- , Eastman Chemical -LRB- $ 51 million -RRB- , Chicago & Northwestern Transportation -LRB- $ 47 million -RRB- , Travelers -LRB- $ 46 million -RRB- , Tenneco -LRB- $ 39 million -RRB- , National Medical Enterprises -LRB- $ 37 million -RRB- , and LTV -LRB- $ 36 million -RRB- .
Mr. Glickenhaus does n't deny that some of his holdings , such as ICN , are controversial .
But he argues that `` the real bargains in the market by definition have to be controversial .
You do best where there are people who doubt what you 've discovered .
'' New York -- Recently three popular string quartets performed on three consecutive nights in Manhattan under three very different auspices and in three very different venues .
No room was anything remotely resembling a chamber , unless you want to count the Bottom Line , normally a jazz club .
And all events were unmistakably populist .
First the Emerson Quartet appeared in Lincoln Center 's mainstream `` Mostly Mozart '' festival before a rapturously enthusiastic crowd filling the large Avery Fisher Hall for a program of Beethoven 's three middle-period `` Razumovsky '' quartets .
The next night , the Balanescu Quartet , an aggressively stylish string ensemble from London , included loudly amplified string-quartet covers of songs by the German rock band Kraftwerk , as part of its contribution to Lincoln Center 's more venturesome `` Serious Fun !
'' festival in the midsized Alice Tully Hall .
The Brodsky Quartet , also British and hip -LRB- it is best known for collaborating with Elvis Costello on a recording and tour last year -RRB- , was the group that performed at the Bottom Line , thanks to the New Music Seminar , which brings progressive rockers to New York each year .
On the evidence of attending the first two of these events and hearing new recordings by all three ensembles , it can be concluded that the string quartet has finally come out of the closet-sized chamber for good -LRB- notwithstanding objections from early-music devotees with their preference for period instruments that are all but inaudible in a modern concert hall -RRB- .
That does n't mean , however , that even the Emerson , with its big-boned tone , will sound all that loud in a symphony hall like Fisher .
But it hardly matters , for the Emerson knows how to play theatrically to the rafters .
In this the Emerson is the true successor of the Juilliard Quartet , which , shortly after World War II , reinvented the string quartet for the modern age .
The Juilliard took the sedate refinement out of the medium and introduced a highly dramatic , quarrelsome , even neurotic style of playing that was just right for the modern music -- the quartets of Bartok , Ives , Schoenberg and Carter -- they were introducing to far-flung audiences .
But more important , the Juilliard played Beethoven the same thrilling way , making him sound just as modern .
Suddenly , and especially through closely miked recordings that put the listener right in the middle of the battlefield , string quartets become something exceeding vital .
The Emerson is softer-edged than the Juilliard , but it has learned its knock - 'em - dead lessons well , nonetheless .
It played the dozen movements of Beethoven 's three ground-breaking middle-period quartets as if they comprised one big heroic , two-hour post-Mahlerian marathon .
Such an epic , of course , was beyond anything Beethoven had envisaged , but it suits our own heroic notion of him just fine .
Most of all , this approach allowed the Emerson , while making the music accessible on the largest imaginable scale , to show just what a dazzling ensemble it is .
Specifically , it gave the Emerson justification to take the finales of the second and third `` Rasumovsky `` s at a hair-raising pace needed to keep momentum from sagging .
But they were so fast that they could only be stopped by a sudden slamming on the breaks , and the effect was not unlike the halt of a minimalist process , a la Philip Glass , that made Beethoven seem modern all over again .
It also allowed Emerson 's eerie and exquisite slow movements .
Ultimately , though , the Emerson is the ideal recording quartet .
Its spectacular sound might have been created for digital reproduction , as evidenced by its robust and spirited new Deutsche Grammophon CD of Dvorak 's gorgeous Piano Quintet and dramatic Piano Quartet , with Menahem Pressler as the ideal quicksilver pianistic partner .
If the Emerson is a latterday Juilliard , the Balanescu Quartet is a Kronos wannabe , and a little too desperate in its imitation of the vanguard American group .
The quartet happens to have a virtuosic leader , Alexander Balanescu , a Romanian-born violinist trained at the Juilliard School , and it can be a gripping ensemble in some of the minimalist music by Michael Nyman and the young U.S. composer Michael Torke it has recorded on Argo .
And perhaps that is just the problem with the Balanescu , which has also made a couple of dreadful pop recordings and which turned its endless three-hour program in Tully into a tasteless exercise in self-promotion .
The quartet 's studied hipness almost always backfired .
The amplification was grating and ugly and made the quartet sound far less accomplished than it is ; Mr. Balanescu 's fedora made him look like a gangster , while his Transylvanian accent removed any final trace of cool from his affected pop singing ; the quartet 's much ballyhooed improvising did not sound spontaneous .
What the Balanescu ends up demonstrating is that while you can take the string quartet out of chamber music you ca n't really take chamber music completely out of the string quartet .
Indeed , the Brodsky , which has made an outstanding recording of the Shostakovich quartet cycle for Teldec , shows how well it knows this in its understated Elvis Costello collaboration , `` The Juliet Letters , '' and it does so on its latest CD , `` Lament '' -LRB- Silva Screen Classics -RRB- .
The new release is a Kronos-like anthology that covers many international bases : a couple of nods to the pop world -LRB- appearances by Mr. Costello and the diva from the film `` Diva , '' Wilhelmenia Fernandez -RRB- ; a work by an intriguing young Mexican postmodernist composer , Javier Alvarez ; the richly haunting `` Lament '' by Australia 's best-known composer , Peter Sculthorpe ; a bit of Stravinsky ; some bouncy minimalism by the quartet 's first violinist , Michael Thomas .
The Brodsky 's playing is somewhere between the ice of the Balanescu and Kronos 's impetuous heat , and its latest disk is ideal for a new generation of still-serious but not staid string-quartet listeners .
Millinocket , Me .
-- Andrew , my English-major stepson , had spotted a volume by Henry David Thoreau open on my desk in my home office in Evanston , Ill. .
`` What a hyprocrite that guy was !
'' Andrew guffawed .
`` He wrote about how he loved living in the woods and getting by on beans , but when he got too cold or hungry he 'd run over to Emerson 's for a hot meal .
'' So maybe the Sage of Walden was n't a perfect human being , but I can report that he must have been some kinda man .
In 1846 , before Nike , Gore-Tex or Cutter -- before there was a trail -- he climbed Mount Katahdin , Maine 's tallest summit and , by some lights , the foremost mountain of New England .
Now I , too , have climbed Katahdin , in the company of Raymond Sokolov , the estimable editor of this page .
We 've been climbing a mountain every few years to prove to one another and , I guess , ourselves , that we can still get , uh , up something .
It 's a middle-aged-male thing , I think .
Regular readers might recall previous Klein-Sokolov -LRB- the billing is alphabetical -RRB- expeditions .
In 1985 we scaled Mount Massive in Colorado , in 1989 Guadalupe Peak in Texas and , back to Colorado , in 1990 Mount Harvard .
While none of those required technical skills , all were considerable hikes , and the two Colorado peaks each exceeded 14,000 feet in height .
When Ray , my mentor in these matters , suggested that we next try Katahdin , whose Baxter Peak is but 5,267 feet above sea level , my reaction was , `` Piece of cake .
'' Hoo-boy , was I wrong .
About two-thirds of the way up , halfway through a seemingly endless boulder field , I seriously considered turning back , and would have if I 'd thought I could have .
Two weeks have passed since the journey , but my scratches and blisters have yet to fully heal .
It was a week before I could walk down stairs without clinging to the railing .
Even Ray , an experienced mountaineer much younger than I -LRB- well , three years younger -RRB- and in better shape because of his devotion to a ridiculous-looking race-walking regimen , confessed that , at Colorado heights , he could n't have done the strenuous climbing that Katahdin required .
Days after the climb I spoke with Jean Hoekwater , the naturalist at Baxter State Park , of which Katahdin is a part .
She allowed , with evident amusement , that my reaction was fairly typical .
`` People who 've climbed in the West come here thinking that Katahdin will be easy , '' she said .
`` They come off it shaking their heads and asking if we 've ever heard of switchbacks .
'' Switchbacks are the gradually rising , serpentine trails that make a lot of the big Western mountains more hike than climb .
Katahdin does n't have 'em .
You hit the trails at about 1,400 feet , and do n't stop climbing until you run out of mountain .
`` We tell people they need to be in good shape to try it , but a lot of them choose not to listen , '' Hoekwater said resignedly .
Withal , Katahdin is a people 's mountain , climbed by thousands annually .
This is both a favorable commentary on the national state of physical fitness and a tribute to Katahdin 's allure .
In central Maine , about 80 miles north of Bangor , it 's a beautiful part of a beautiful state , ringed by lakes and forest .
It 's the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail , which stretches almost 2,000 miles down to Springer Mountain , Ga. .
Katahdin 's best PR came from Thoreau , whose account of his trip there is a chapter in his book `` The Maine Woods .
'' He waxed eloquent about then-empty land while foreseeing , and bemoaning , it 's civilizing .
His assault on the peak of the mountain he spelled `` Ktaadn '' came when he was age 29 .
He was stopped short by a mist that all but the enveloped the craggy heights , but glimpsed enough of them to come away awed .
`` The mountain seemed an aggregation of loose rocks , as if some time it had rained rocks , and they lay as they fell on the mountain sides , '' he wrote .
`` It was vast , Titanic , such as man never inhabits .
Some part of the beholder , even some vital part , seems to escape through the loose grating of his ribs as he ascends .
Nature has got him at a disadvantage ... She does not smile on him as in the plains .
She seems to say sternly , why came ye here before your time ?
'' I was to ask myself that same question .
Thoreau reached the mountain from Bangor by carriage and canoe ; Ray and I drove up on I-95 from the Bangor airport .
Undoubtedly , Thoreau 's route was more scenic , but we also got some of the flavor of the state .
`` Eat lobster .
It 's good for you and good for Maine , '' said one radio commercial we heard .
`` Moose Crossing , '' read a road sign when we reached the woods .
We spent the night at an old inn near the park , and were up at dawn for the climb .
Starting at about 6:30 a.m. from Roaring Brook Campground in warm , sunny weather , we covered the 3.3 miles to Chimney Pond in about 2 1\/2 hours , not too badly the worse for wear .
We intended to proceed from there to Baxter Peak via the relatively friendly Helon Taylor Trail , but missed a turn and found ourselves on Cathedral Trail instead .
Bad mistake .
So named because it passes three immense `` cathedral '' rocks , it 's one of the steepest and toughest of the 13 routes to the top .
It 's 1.7 miles , all rock and all up , and marked only by dabs of blue paint at irregular intervals .
I had to stop for breath many times , and might be there still if Ray had n't pointed out that , there being nowhere to plug in my laptop , I could n't set up housekeeping .
Ultimately finding it easier to go up than down , we reached Baxter Peak at about noon .
The descent , by a more gradual route , was easier on the lungs but harder on the calves .
That 's why I went down stairs one at a time for a week .
We saw lots of other climbers along the way , most of them far younger and more agile than us .
Mountain climbing is easier at age 20 and 130 pounds than at 50-something and 190 -LRB- OK , 195 -RRB- .
But hats off to the kids anyway .
In retrospect , I found the experience comparable to my Army service : something nice to have done .
The scenery was lovely .
Driving out of the park at day 's end , we saw a bear .
And afterward there was Nuprin .
Thoreau did n't have that either , did he ?
The poetry of Langston Hughes , the novels of Zora Neale Hurston , the paintings of Romare Bearden -- all burst onto the cultural scene in America during the brief flowering of black arts and letters that we call the Harlem Renaissance .
Begun in 1920 and fading by the end of the decade , it was , for its participants , a moment of unprecedented optimism and passionate hope .
That moment is caught splendidly in `` The Portable Harlem Renaissance Reader , '' edited by David Levering Lewis -LRB- Viking , 766 pages , $ 27.95 -RRB- .
Mr. Lewis , who is Martin Luther King Jr. .
Professor of History at Rutgers University , biographer of W.E.B. DuBois and author of a lively history of the Harlem Renaissance , has gathered a rich sampling of poetry and prose from some 50 of the period 's most memorable writers .
Their achievements , summarized in a useful biographical appendix , are impressive ; their voices courageous , forthright -- and doomed .
As Mr. Lewis shows us , the story of the Harlem Renaissance is the story of shattered dreams .
In 1920 , of more than 10 million blacks in America , only 10,000 were college-educated professionals .
From this `` Talented Tenth '' -LRB- of one percent -RRB- , as W.E.B. DuBois called the group , emerged a cadre of reformers with a new idea for fighting racial prejudice .
Dissatisfied with the earnest efforts of civil-rights groups , offended by Marcus Garvey 's back-to-Africa movement , the Talented Tenth had one goal : to promote black contributions to the arts and thereby to reinvent black identity in the culture at large .
`` Until the art of the black folk compels recognition , '' DuBois argued , `` they will not be rated as human .
'' Leaders of the Harlem Renaissance -- dubbed the `` Niggerati '' by Hurston -- earnestly believed they could foster enormous changes for the whole black community .
`` They were sure the New Negro would lead a new life from then on in green pastures of tolerance created by Countee Cullen , Ethel Waters , Claude McKay , Duke Ellington , Bojangles , and Alain Locke , '' Langston Hughes commented sardonically .
From the beginning there was an uneasy relationship between the Niggerati and the civil-rights organizations -- the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Urban League -- that initially promoted the creative work of blacks in their own journals .
The NAACP and NUL took a conservative , view of the kind of art they believed was appropriate : In poetry , they favored the lyrical over the provocative ; in music , Mr. Lewis tells us , they scorned jazz and blues for spirituals `` sung like lieder by the disciplined Hall Johnson Choir .
'' Alain Locke , a former Rhodes scholar with a Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard , balked at this provincialism and realized that the movement could succeed only with support from the white community .
As the movement 's urbane spokesman , Locke easily elicited help from fascinated white artists and writers to publish , exhibit and publicize the works of blacks .
Suddenly whites found themselves reading Jean Toomer 's `` Cane , '' seeing all-black casts perform Eugene O'Neill plays at the Provincetown Playhouse and invading Harlem for an evening with Bessie Smith .
`` It was the period , '' Hughes wrote , `` when the Negro was in vogue .
'' By the mid-1920s , white support extended even further when many black writers and artists found unexpected affinity with members of the Lost Generation .
In Greenwich Village coffee houses and bookshops , blacks discovered that their dismay over `` the ruling Anglo-Saxon cultural paradigm '' was shared by such Marxist radicals as John Reed and Max Eastman , such writers of the `` Lyrical Left '' as Robert Frost , Van Wyck Brooks and Matthew Josephson .
But if their rebellion seemed to stem from the same source , in reality blacks and whites had diametrically different goals .
`` For the whites , '' Mr. Lewis tells us , `` art was the means to change society before they would accept it .
For the blacks , art was the means to change society in order to be accepted into it .
'' By 1935 , it was clear to both blacks and whites that neither goal would be fully realized .
Moreover , although interest among whites appeared to swell , the focus of that interest was diverted from black art and literature to the excitement of a forbidden `` primitive '' culture .
Residents of Harlem saw their community as a thriving Manhattan neighborhood of gracious brownstones , offering ample opportunity for employment and relatively cheap real estate .
Whites , however , who saw it only on Saturday nights , defined it as exotic territory .
In Harlem , they could find smoke-filled cellars where husky-voiced women sang the blues , glittering nightclubs with big bands and gaudy floor shows , and cabarets that vibrated with wild , percussive rhythms .
It was no surprise to many blacks when the vogue for Harlem proved as transitory as fads for other amusements -- the Charleston , say , or the Lindy Hop .
`` I was there , '' Hughes wrote .
`` I had a swell time while it lasted ... But I thought it would n't last long .
For how could a large and enthusiastic number of people be crazy about Negroes forever ?

NEW YORK -- Stocks followed bonds lower as concerns about inflation reemerged and the dollar tumbled against major currencies .
The gains that stocks posted on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates by a half percentage point have been largely erased .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average , which rallied 24.28 after the Fed 's move , yesterday skidded 21.05 , or 0.56 % , to 3755.43 .
It fell 8.09 Wednesday .
Broad-based indexes were lower yesterday , but somewhat more buoyant than the industrial average .
They remain modestly above their levels before the Fed tightening .
A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia helped to crush investors ' budding optimism that inflation would remain mild for the near term .
The central bank branch yesterday morning said prices that manufacturers in its region pay and receive have risen solidly this month .
That news caused some investors to begin to question the consensus view that the Fed had landed a strong blow against inflation Tuesday and would n't have to tighten again until at least November , said Joseph McAlinden , a market strategist at Dillon Read .
Long-term government bonds ended the day about even with their levels before the rate increases , down more than one point to yield 7.48 % .
Weakness in the dollar added to concerns among stock and bond investors .
The currency tumbled to 98.57 yen and 1.5430 marks , from 100.21 yen and 1.5525 marks late Wednesday .
Concerns about the U.S. trade deficit with Japan played a large role in the declines .
Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index fell 2.00 , or 0.43 % , to 463.17 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index lost 0.91 , or 0.35 % , to 255.49 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index edged higher for part of the day before closing with a loss of 0.49 , or 0.07 % , at 742.17 .
The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index slipped 1.39 , or 0.31 % , to 443.55 .
Cyclical stocks were among the weakest , including shares of the major auto makers .
Ford Motor dropped 1 1\/8 to 29 1\/2 , General Motors 1 1\/8 to 49 7\/8 and Chrysler 1 1\/8 to 47 1\/4 .
Steven Einhorn , a market strategist at Goldman Sachs , attributed those losses , and the relative strength in the growth-oriented Nasdaq Stock Market , partly to concerns that interest-rate increases will slow the economy and crimp corporate profits .
Profits at cyclicals rise and fall with the business cycle , while growth companies tend to deliver consistent profit gains .
Mr. Einhorn , though , does n't expect a significant economic slowdown .
He expects stocks to climb solidly through year end and into 1995 .
Takeover speculation lifted share prices in several industry groups , blunting the market 's overall slide .
Quaker Oats surged 5 7\/8 to 82 on unsubstantiated acquisition rumors .
Such talk has lifted Quaker and other food stocks several times in recent weeks .
The Chicago company declined to comment when asked by the New York Stock Exchange to explain the unusual activity in its stock .
Other gainers among food stocks included Kellogg , which jumped 2 1\/8 to 56 5\/8 ; General Mills , 1 5\/8 to 55 3\/8 , and Wm. Wrigley Jr. , 1 3\/8 to 43 5\/8 .
Mylan Laboratories climbed 2 1\/4 to 26 1\/4 on speculation that it could be acquired .
Following Wednesday 's agreement between American Cyanamid and American Home Products , investors are placing bets on other drug companies they think could be acquired .
Officials of Mylan were n't available to comment .
Cyanamid , which jumped 2 1\/8 Wednesday , was unchanged at 96 1\/8 .
American Home Products fell 3\/8 to 58 7\/8 .
International Business Machines jumped 1 3\/8 to 66 1\/4 , setting a new 52-week high for the second straight day .
Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Mandresh raised his earnings estimates , saying the company might earn as much as $ 4.50 a share this year .
He had projected $ 4 .
He expects Big Blue 's revenue growth in the second half to top the 4 % rise it recorded in the first six months .
Lotus Development tumbled 4 7\/16 to 41 5\/16 on Nasdaq after several analysts made negative comments .
Dean Witter Reynolds analyst Timothy McCollum said many Wall Street analysts have been too optimistic about the software company 's third-quarter earnings .
He does n't expect sales in its application software business to rebound significantly in the quarter .
Abbott Laboratories fell 7\/8 to 30 1\/4 .
Smith Barney downgraded its investment rating on the company to `` neutral '' from `` outperform .
'' Analyst Bob Goldman said the stock on Wednesday hit his price target of 33 .
L.M. Ericsson climbed 2 5\/8 to 54 on Nasdaq after the company said its pretax profit rose to $ 298 million in the first half from $ 168 million a year earlier .
The Swedish communications concern said it expects its results to improve further in the second half .
Dresser Industries slipped 3\/8 to 20 .
The oil field services company 's earnings fell to 20 cents a share in its third quarter , ended July 31 , from 25 cents a year ago .
Navistar , a truck maker , added 7\/8 to 14 7\/8 after it reported a third-quarter profit of 17 cents a share , reversing a year-ago loss of $ 9.99 a share , which included a big charge for employee benefits .
Harnischfeger dropped 1 1\/4 to 22 1\/8 after it agreed to acquire Joy Technologies , a maker of mining equipment , through a stock swap .
Joy , a small-capitalization issue , added 2 to 12 .
NEW YORK -- Precious-metals prices climbed in reaction to a weakening dollar and slumping bond prices , but analysts still doubt a long-term rally will develop .
December-delivery gold on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $ 3.60 an ounce to $ 385.90 .
Comex division December-deliver silver rose 4.6 cents an ounce to $ 5.235 .
The dollar slid after the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan widened sharply to $ 5.52 billion in June from $ 4.39 billion in May .
The deficit with Japan was the highest since March , when the trade gap was $ 5.80 billion .
Adding to the dollar 's woes -- and aiding the precious-metals market -- were tough comments from both the U.S. and Japan on their trade dispute .
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the U.S. wants concessions to resolve the two countries ' trade conflicts , while Japan 's Foreign Minister Yohei Kono warned that Japan would break off negotiations if the U.S. tries to punish Japan over trade .
The bond market 's sell-off , on worries that the Federal Reserve 's recent interestrate boosts could still fail to restrain inflation , also lifted precious metals , which are a leading inflation hedge .
After shooting higher following the Fed 's tightening on Tuesday , bond prices have flagged for two days .
`` The key to the markets ' strength is the weakness in the dollar and a renewal in the downturn in bond prices , '' said William O'Neill , chief futures strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York .
Also feeding the bullish tilt of precious-metals traders was the Philadelphia Fed 's business outlook survey for August , which showed a sharp rise in its price components .
The `` prices paid '' index , which tracks prices manufacturers pay for parts and materials , jumped to 48.4 in August from 36.4 in July .
Even scarier , analysts said , was the big gain in the `` prices received '' index , which measures the price of manufacturers ' output ; it shot up to 24.5 in August from 15.8 in July .
Once yesterday 's rally took hold , buying related to computer-driven trading strategies helped keep prices aloft , analysts said .
George Milling-Stanley , precious-metals analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York , said traders have been testing the $ 385 resistance level for December gold .
`` After the trade figure was released , there was enough buying to trigger that level , and we 've managed to hold it very well there , '' he said .
Likewise , silver for December was buoyed by computer-generated buying above $ 5.21 an ounce , Merrill Lynch 's Mr. O'Neill said .
The price hit an intraday high of $ 5.25 before settling back a bit .
Despite the lift , analysts do n't expect any fireworks from precious metals .
Mr. O'Neill said gold producers are watching closely for an opportunity to sell .
Such potential sales hanging over the market will likely keep a lid on prices .
`` I doubt the rally will be extended , '' he said .
`` Producers will be there to sell on a significant rally beyond the current level .
'' Mr. Milling-Stanley of Lehman Brothers believes both gold and silver will continue to trade in a fairly narrow range , with gold moving between $ 380 and $ 390 an ounce in the short term , and silver between $ 5 and $ 5.25 .
`` I 'll get interested , or even excited , about these metals when they get out of these ranges , '' he said .
SUGAR : Worries about lower sugar harvests in Europe , Russia and Cuba drove prices higher .
October-delivery sugar on the New York Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange rose 26 cents , to $ 12.11 a pound .
Arthur Stevenson , a Prudential Securities analyst , said hot , dry weather across Europe is sparking concerns about a stunted crop in that region .
`` And today there was a report that Russia is likely to see a sugarbeet harvest that 's substantially below last year 's , '' he added .
A poor Russian harvest would not only cut world supplies but also boost Russian sugar imports , buoying prices .
What 's more , `` the Cuban sugar production program is having a lot of problems , '' Mr. Stevenson said .
`` It 's so severe that lately they 've conceded that much of the sugar cane did n't take root this year because they were using low-quality seeds .
'' Also supporting prices are expectations of increased buying by China .
Steven Platt , senior analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago , said China 's demand continues to grow with its expanding economy .
`` It looks like they 'll have to be importing more , '' he said .
ENERGY : Crude-oil and petroleum-product futures fell in technically oriented trading .
Activity was dominated by position adjustments ahead of Monday 's expiration of the September crude-futures contract , rather than by further news out of Nigeria , traders said .
Nigeria 's military government on Wednesday acted to remove the leaders of the two striking oil workers unions and sparked a one-day rally on the belief the country 's oil exports would continue to be disrupted .
The unions said they would ignore the government 's order dissolving their governing board , continue their strike and file a lawsuit challenging the government 's action .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , September-delivery crude oil settled at $ 17.72 a barrel , down 39 cents .
SEOUL , South Korea -- Union leaders and management at Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. , an arm of the giant Hyundai conglomerate , returned to the negotiating table on Thursday in a bid to resolve a 56-day-old strike .
The walkout has cost the huge shipbuilder about $ 530 million in revenue and $ 750 million in new orders .
It also has perpetuated Hyundai 's reputation as a company struggling with persistent labor unrest at a time when overall union activity in South Korea is on the wane .
But with the South Korean economy maturing and union leaders in general adopting a more moderate tone , Hyundai 's radical labor group appears to be suffering more of an image problem than management , analysts say .
That could weaken its position as the strike progresses , they predict .
`` Overall , public opinion is n't in favor of the union , '' says Kim Jong Seok , professor of economics at Hong Ik University .
`` Hyundai management seems to be betting that the union 's rank-and-file will eventually discredit the leadership , and they may be right .
'' Hyundai 's Ulsan shipyards on the southeastern tip of Korea employ about 21,000 unionized workers and are home to some of the country 's most extreme labor organizers .
Last year , a 46-day strike at Ulsan cost the company millions of dollars in revenue and ended only with the dispatch of riot police .
The government so far has avoided getting involved in this year 's strife .
Labor activity at Hyundai 's other affiliates , including Hyundai Motor Co. , has been insignificant .
The union 's demands -- higher pay , improved safety conditions and greater representation in board decisions -- are similar to those made last year .
Under South Korean law , employment terms are negotiable every year , and walkouts and sitdown strikes have been a spring ritual since the country 's democratization began in the mid-1980s .
Recently , however , the level and intensity of labor unrest have declined .
As of June 3 , labor strife this year had cost local business 167.3 billion won -LRB- $ 207.5 million -RRB- , down 83 % from last year , according to the Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy .
A study conducted by the Labor Ministry shows that 59 % of companies with more than 100 employees had settled wage disputes as of June 29 , compared with 48 % the year before .
Among 392 affiliates of South Korea 's big conglomerates , 42 % had settled , compared with 38 % a year earlier .
In a sign of the dwindling influence of labor leaders , a general strike in early June at Daewoo Shipbuilding & Heavy Machinery Ltd. fizzled in less than a day .
Analysts attribute the decline to improved relations between management and union leaders and a growing recognition that perennial labor activity is a drain on the economy .
Restive unions , for example , are blamed for the decline in foreign investment in South Korea from its peak in the late 1980s .
`` Hyundai Heavy 's union is very much an idiosyncrasy , '' said Don Lee , an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd. in Seoul .
`` There is a perception that they are just too radical .
'' Mr. Lee says the Hyundai strike could slightly weaken growth in South Korean exports , which the government has forecast at about 12 % this year .
That could chip away at the economy , which is expected to expand by a robust 8.5 % in 1994 .
But overall , `` it does n't seem like the government and the press are even giving it much attention , '' Mr. Lee says .
That is of little comfort to Hyundai Heavy .
C.H. Jon , an analyst at Baring Securities Ltd. in Seoul , estimates the company 's net income this year at 257 billion won on sales of 3.02 trillion won , down from a pre-strike forecast of 304 billion won in profit and 3.5 trillion won in revenue .
Boatmen 's Bancshares Inc. agreed to acquire Worthen Banking Corp. , a Little Rock. , Ark. bank-holding company partly owned by the controversial Stephens family , for Boatman 's stock valued at about $ 583 million .
Boatmen 's , a St. Louis bank-holding concern , said its acquisition of Arkansas ' largest bank -- with 112 branches in that state and $ 3.5 billion in assets -- will give it a `` dominant '' 20 % share of the Arkansas banking market .
The planned transaction also would boost Boatmen 's presence in Texas , where Worthen has offices in the Austin area .
Boatmen 's has assets of $ 28 billion .
The accord could provide a graceful way out for the Stephens family , which owns 25 % of Worthen shares on a fully diluted basis .
The Federal Reserve Board has been investigating ties between Worthen and the family , which also owns Little Rock investment bank Stephens Inc. .
Under federal law , it is illegal for an investment-banking firm to control a bank .
The Fed 's formal investigation began 16 months ago , according to Worthen .
`` Frankly , I 'm not sure where it stands , '' Curt Bradbury , Worthen 's chairman , said yesterday .
Under the terms of the definitive pact , Worthen holders will swap each of their shares for one share in Boatmen 's .
The 17.3 million shares Boatmen 's expects to issue in order to effect the acquisition represents a 14 % stake .
The Stephens family would get Boatmen 's stock valued at $ 148.5 million .
This would put the family 's stake in the combined company below the threshold that requires public reporting of ownership .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading late yesterday , Boatmen 's shares slipped 68.75 cents to $ 33.688 ; Worthen 's shares also declined , 24 cents a share , to $ 30.75 on the American Stock Exchange .
The price Boatmen 's is paying is nearly two times Worthen 's June 30 book value of $ 17.22 a share .
But the price provides little premium to Worthen 's trading price , reflecting widespread investor anticipation that the Arkansas concern would shortly find a buyer .
Last month , Worthen hired PaineWebber Inc. to help it review its `` strategic alternatives .
'' But rumors that such a move might be in the works , fueled by a management change at the company , had pushed the stock up months before that announcement .
Joseph A. Stieven , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in St. Louis , said the Worthen transaction makes `` strategic sense '' for Boatmen 's because it currently holds only a small market share in Arkansas .
`` They always like to have the dominant , or large , market position in every market they 're in , '' he added .
He called the price `` fair , but not excessive .
'' Boatmen 's said it expects the transaction to result in after-tax revenue enhancements and cost savings of about $ 13 million next year and $ 26 million in 1996 .
It will dilute per-share earnings in 1995 by about 1 % , or four cents a share , but add to such earnings in the following year .
The transaction , which is expected to close during the first quarter of 1995 , is subject to regulatory approval and the approval of Worthen shareholders , Boatmen 's said .
If the transaction is approved , it could lessen federal scrutiny of the Stephens family .
`` This may have been the easiest way out '' of the Fed inquiry , said Bill Baldwin , an analyst at Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. in Dallas .
However , Worthen 's Mr. Bradbury said that the company agreed to the merger because it was a good deal .
Regarding the investigation , `` I have no idea whether the merger will help , hurt or be neutral , '' he said .
The Stephens ' holding in Worthen and the Fed investigation have been a focus of the Republican attack on President Clinton 's financial dealings when he was Arkansas governor .
Worthen and Stephens employees provided substantial financial support for Mr. Clinton 's presidential campaign , among other Stephens ties to the Clintons .
Representatives of the Stephens declined to comment yesterday .

For most of its 14 years , Cable News Network enjoyed such a sizable lead in the business of televising 24-hour-a-day global news that it never really had to worry about those trailing behind .
But lately , the business has turned into a race , and a crowded one at that -- raising questions about what it will take for the players to compete effectively , and whether there are enough viewers to go around .
The latest of the newcomers is the venerable British Broadcasting Corp. , which is talking with potential partners about starting a 24-hour news channel in the U.S. next year to go up against CNN , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. .
In the fall , BBC will launch a separate 24-hour station -- this one geared to European viewers -- that will compete with CNN International , Turner 's round-the-clock global news service .
Such moves would pose the first potentially serious challenge to CNN 's dominance of the 24-hour news market .
Anticipating this threat , CNN plans to start offering CNN International , which is now available only outside the U.S. , to domestic cable subscribers next January .
As if that were n't enough for the market to absorb , there are also several other players vying for a piece of the action in global news .
Reuters Holdings PLC , for example , has begun providing raw footage of breaking events to various broadcasters on a 24-hour basis -LRB- the Associated Press plans to begin a similar service later this year -RRB- .
National Broadcasting Corp. plans to start an overnight business-news broadcast in Asia later this year as part of Australia Broadcasting Corp. 's 24-hour Asia-news channel .
And Dow Jones & Co. , which publishes The Wall Street Journal and already operates Asia Business News , a 24-hour financial-news channel in the Far East , recently took an option on satellite broadcast time as a possible prelude to a European television venture .
Media executives believe that , with many countries opening their airwaves to satellite and cable channels , and with more people in developing nations able to afford TV sets , there is pent-up demand just waiting to be filled .
`` Live coverage of global events is an extremely precious commodity for certain kinds of people , '' says Peter C. Vesey , vice president of CNN International .
Hugh Williams , director of programming for BBC World Service Television , agrees : `` The public wishes to be informed about the world .
There is room out there for competition .
'' Despite such enthusiasm , however , several hurdles exist , not the least of which is the price of staying in the game .
Televising international news , especially around the clock , can consume tens of millions of dollars in start-up costs alone .
And after that , it could be years before profits materialize .
CNN did n't make money until its fifth year .
EuroNews , a 24-hour news channel that was launched in 1993 and draws programming from five publicly financed European TV stations , overshot its first-year budget by $ 10 million .
Its European rival , Sky News -- aired by British Sky Broadcasting Ltd. , which is 50 % owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. -- has yet to turn a profit after six years -LRB- although BSkyB overall is profitable because of its entertainment channels -RRB- .
Just as fundamental is the issue of viewer interest in nonstop news .
If you broadcast it , will they watch ?
When it comes to world news , audiences are notoriously fickle .
People tend to tune in when a crisis hits and then switch off when the story fades .
CNN 's share of viewing households , for example , has declined steadily over the past two years , after explosive growth following the 1991 Gulf War .
Although viewership in the second quarter of this year ran about even with last year 's , buoyed as it was by interest in the O.J. Simpson case , CNN 's U.S. ratings fell 25 % in the first quarter .
`` It 's difficult to justify more than one network catering to a specific niche , '' says Fred Moran , a media analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York .
Still , he adds , `` that does n't mean it 's not a worthwhile undertaking .
'' Broadcasters also face problems with language , for it goes without saying that not all the residents of the global village speak the same tongue .
And local politics can become a delicate matter as well .
Earlier this year , Mr. Murdoch dropped BBC World Service from his Asian satellite network , Star Television , saying the Chinese government objected to the British broadcaster 's reporting .
All of these factors , and others , could have particular impact on the rivalry shaping up between CNN and BBC .
While CNN 's forte has proved to be live coverage of breaking news , BBC plans to market its skills in analytical and in-depth reporting , says Mr. Williams , the BBC programming director .
`` The BBC name , '' he notes , `` has resonance throughout the world .
'' But resonance might not be enough .
`` CNN has locked-in-place agreements with most cable companies , '' Mr. Moran points out .
This means that , regardless of whether they carry any other news services , these operators must carry CNN .
Such agreements could stymie a BBC all-news channel before it even gets out of the starting gate .
Of course , CNN 's contracts with the cable operators do have expiration dates .
And BBC has indicated that it is willing to pay operators handsomely to carry its programming .
However , the state-operated British broadcaster wo n't be able to use taxpayer funds for its cable operations , which is why it is looking for American partners with deep pockets .
Privately owned Cox Enterprises Inc. -- the 12th-largest U.S. media company , with $ 2.7 billion in annual revenue -- is a likely candidate .
The Atlanta-based company is currently selling shares in its Cox Cable division in a public offering .
A Cox spokeswoman confirms that company officials and BBC are discussing `` how to expand our current partnership .
What form that will take has not yet been decided .
'' Cox and BBC are already partners in UK Gold , an entertainment channel that rebroadcasts popular BBC shows .
-LRB- For the planned European all-news channel , BBC 's partner is Pearson PLC , the giant U.K. media company .
-RRB- In the U.S. , at least , BBC may find the pickings slim once it does get on the air .
CNN 's main subscriber growth these days comes from CNN International , whose content is 80 % foreign news .
CNN International currently has 79.7 million subscribers , up from just 11.6 million in October 1991 ; the largest groups of these subscribers are in Italy and Germany .
Moreover , BBC 's status as a government-funded agency has protected it from the rough-and-tumble competition of American-style broadcast news .
When a bomb blasted the Israeli Embassy in London a few weeks ago , viewers saw footage of the wreckage on EuroNews before they did on either of the two BBC London channels .
Mr. Williams acknowledges the likely struggles ahead .
`` It would be an immodest broadcaster , '' he says , `` who thinks entering the U.S. market is not an incredibly complex and difficult thing .

Airbus Industrie named Nicholas R. Tomassetti , a senior marketing executive at McDonnell Douglas Corp. 's commercial airplane unit , to be the European aircraftmaking consortium 's president of North American operations .
The departure of Mr. Tomassetti , 58 years old , is the second this month from the McDonnell Douglas division , which has been struggling to keep up its orders and production .
It is the third-largest producer of jetliners , behind Boeing Co. and second-ranked Airbus .
Last week , Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. announced that Preston A. Henne , 46 , will leave McDonnell Douglas as manager of its MD-90 twin-jet program to oversee development of the Gulfstream V business jet , starting in September .
Mr. Tomassetti already has assumed his new post .
Neither man was available to comment .
A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said the departures are `` coincidental , '' and represent logical career progressions .
A temporary successor for Mr. Henne will be named , but it is n't clear whether the two jobs will be permanently filled , the spokesman said .
Analysts and others in the industry have questioned the impact on St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas from losing two key commercial-jet managers in such a short period .
Mr. Henne has been in charge of certification of the MD-90 , a two-engine jet that is the most advanced of McDonnell Douglas 's products .
The plane is slated to be certified by regulators later this year , with first deliveries set for early 1995 .
The McDonnell Douglas spokesman noted that most of the work toward certification is complete .
In his new role , Mr. Henne will nurture the Gulfstream V as it approaches its own first flight next year .
Initial deliveries will be late in 1996 .
Mr. Tomassetti 's arrival last year at McDonnell Douglas was considered a coup for that jet maker in the eyes of its rivals .
He is a veteran of United Technolgies Corp. 's Pratt & Whitney engines unit and a Pratt & Whitney venture called International Aero Engines .
He had been managing McDonnell Douglas 's efforts to market a possible new 100-seat jet called the MD-95 , designed to reinvigorate the company 's product line and beef up its order backlog .
He also had been charged with marketing the DC-9X program , which aims to get airlines to refurbish their older DC-9 airliners as a way to keep the manufacturer 's products in carriers ' fleets until new jets can be purchased .
At Airbus , Mr. Tomassetti will oversee sales efforts in the U.S. , Canada and Mexico .
The Airbus consortium comprises British Aerospace PLC , Aerospatiale SA of France , the Deutsche Aerospace unit of Daimler-Benz AG of Germany and Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain .

SARATOGA BRANDS Inc. -LRB- New York -RRB- -- Scott G. Halperin was named chief executive of the snack-foods and personal-computer concern , succeeding Dan Feld , who remains a consultant .

He also remains president and CEO of Agama Inc. , a Santa Monica , Calif. , investment company .
PRAGUE -- Chemapol Group Ltd. is n't used to getting kicked around , least of all by the government .
But these days , the Czech Republic 's main foreign trader of crude oil and chemicals is taking hits in a high-stakes battle over privatizing the country 's oil refineries .
The sale has created an uproar as talk swirls of Russian organized crime and communist-era spies .
The target of rumor and suspicion has been Vaclav Junek , Chemapol 's 43-year-old chief executive .
There 's no doubt that Mr. Junek and the company he leads are an ambitious bunch .
After all , they 've taken on no less than a consortium of France 's Total SA , Royal Dutch\/Shell Group , Italy 's Agip Petroli SpA and DuPont Co. 's Conoco Inc. unit of the U.S. in the privatization bid .
In May , it even appeared that , despite tight finances , Chemapol had beaten the four giants in what has become the Czech Republic 's most protracted privatization battle .
Since then , Chemapol has come under sharp attack by the interior ministry and local columnists who portray the company as a virtual pawn of Russia 's oil barons and as an organization managed by at least one former member of the communist secret police -- widely reputed to be Mr. Junek himself .
He has denied any such connection .
With a refinery project under reconsideration , and likely to be decided in September , Chemapol 's chances appear increasingly remote .
Mr. Junek , a Chemapol executive since 1975 , is trying to get on with business .
`` This has to do with many other things than with me , or the privatization of the refineries , or with Chemapol , '' he said .
`` We are just the soccer ball that other powers -- within the government or wherever -- are kicking around .
'' Mr. Junek said a petrochemical complex is just what Chemapol has in mind -- and just what the Czech petrochemical industry needs to brace itself against foreign competition .
The company is in place to buy substantial stakes in many of the country 's largest chemical plants and pharmaceutical companies , with several of the sales awaiting government approval .
Little of that has translated into increased profits , but other changes have .
Chemapol in 1991 began to shift away from its 1 % commission sales to trade oil and other commodities on its own account .
That helped Chemapol boost its pretax profits last year by 62 % -- to 816 million korunas -LRB- $ 29.1 million -RRB- -- despite a 20 % drop in total revenue .
Still , Chemapol 's uncertain financial strength has led analysts to question whether it can afford the refinery privatization .
The two main petrochemical plants , and subjects of the debate , Chemopetrol AS in Litvinov and the smaller Kaucuk AS in Kralupy , will require as much as $ 1 billion in investments in the next five years .
As part of its bid to take a 49 % stake in just the plants ' refining operations , the Western consortium has pledged up to $ 520 million for modernization .
Mr. Junek said the refinery project , even with the help of outside lenders and investors , would gobble up much of Chemapol 's investment resources , allowing little room for expansion in other areas .
But the decline of its essential monopoly over the country 's oil imports , Chemapol 's future prosperity will depend on its ability to adapt and to move into new services and new markets .
It may be better suited than most companies here to face the task .
Reorganized as a joint-stock company in 1968 , Chemapol was at least nominally owned by a group of nearly 100 state-run institutions , who remain shareholders .
As a result , Chemapol escaped the turmoil of privatization .
The company has also been able to build on its network of units abroad .
So while exports to former Soviet-bloc countries have dropped to just a sliver of their pre-revolution levels , exports elsewhere in the world have held relatively steady at around $ 230 million last year .
And for the first half of this year , Chemapol saw its export sales increase 26 % .
But it may not be easy for Chemapol to turn its back on the refineries .
The sale of imported crude oil and petrochemicals accounted for 56 % of Chemapol 's revenue last year .
Chemapol imports 95 % of the country 's oil by a pipeline from Russia , the Czech Republic 's sole source of crude .
That will change in late 1995 or early 1996 with the completion of the Ingolstadt pipeline running from Bavaria to the Kaucuk refinery .
Were the Western consortium to win the refinery bid , Chemapol 's grip over Czech oil imports would surely diminish .
Mr. Junek , takes an optimistic view .
`` We will see our import business go down , '' he said , `` but we at least hope the consortium would use our services for the next several years .
'' NEW YORK -- A crackdown on New York City lawyers for failing to file tax returns began yesterday as three lawyers pleaded guilty to the charges in federal court here .
The prosecutions are the first of several expected to be announced .
Defense attorneys say that at least a dozen lawyers , some from major New York law firms , have been notified that they are under investigation .
U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the Internal Revenue Service investigation of New York lawyers is continuing .
A spokesman for her office said , `` Attorneys are expected to comply with the law like all other citizens .
The IRS is always seeking to detect violators by focusing on groups .
'' The three lawyers who appeared in court all admitted to federal misdemeanor charges as part of their plea agreements with prosecutors .
The plea agreements enabled the lawyers to avoid more serious state felony charges , which could have led to automatic disbarment , said New York State Tax Commissioner James Wetzler .
The three who entered guilty pleas are Howard B. Hornstein , a partner at Fischbein Badillo Wagner Itzler ; Henry J. Clay Jr. , a partner at DeWitt Lockman & DeWitt ; and Peter Anderson , a solo practitioner in the Bronx .
Mr. Hornstein and Mr. Clay also pleaded guilty to state misdemeanor charges .
Each faces a sentence of four to nine months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines , plus fines .
Defense attorney Robert Fink of Kostelanetz & Fink , who is representing two lawyers facing possible charges , said 12 to 20 New York attorneys have been targeted in the investigation .
Mr. Fink said the New York prosecutions have been harsher than similar inquiries into lawyers ' tax filings in other cities .
He said IRS investigations focusing on lawyers in Philadelphia , Illinois and Los Angeles used collection agents , for instance , before turning to prosecutors .
`` Lawyers in New York City are being treated , No. 1 , differently from other taxpayers and , No. 2 , differently from other lawyers in other parts of the country , '' he said .
Other defense attorneys said the lawyers are being unfairly singled out for criminal tax prosecutions , rather than civil charges .
In court , Mr. Hornstein , 47 years old , pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor count for not filing federal tax returns for 1989 , 1990 and 1991 .
His total adjusted income for those years was about $ 911,437 .
Mr. Hornstein is a former commissioner of the New York City Planning Board and a former member of the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals .
Gerald Shargel , Mr. Hornstein 's attorney , said his failure to file was `` an aberrant act '' caused by `` very serious personal problems '' that included business setbacks and his wife 's bout with cancer .
Mr. Anderson , 49 , admitted he did n't file city , state and federal tax returns for 1988 , 1989 , 1990 and 1991 despite income totaling about $ 281,489 during that time .
His attorney , Murray Richman , blamed Mr. Anderson 's failure to file on illness .
Mr. Clay , 42 , pleaded guilty to failing to file for the years 1988 , 1989 and 1991 despite an approximate total income of $ 319,650 .
His lawyer , John J. Tigue Jr. , said that Mr. Clay has since filed all his tax returns and paid the taxes owed .
TOKYO -- A public auction for Japan Tobacco shares ended Thursday amid rumors that small investors have bid far more for the cigarette maker 's stock than analysts and professional investors believe it is worth .
Some analysts fear that the huge offering -- it is Japan 's third big privatization in recent years -- could tumble in value after its October listing , taking a broad swath of Japanese shares down in its wake .
Japan Tobacco stock will be offered in October at the weighted average bid from this week 's auction of 230,000 shares .
Though the Finance Ministry wo n't announce the auction results until Aug. 29 , Tokyo brokers said many independent investors bid between 1 million and 1.2 million yen -LRB- $ 9,980 and $ 11,975 -RRB- a share .
Institutional investors , by contrast , are only willing to pay an average of 909,000 yen -LRB- $ 9,070 -RRB- , according to a recent survey of 30 institutions published by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper .
`` If it opens high , that is on balance a negative for the stock market , '' said Charles Lambert , an analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. .
An overpriced offering is unlikely to depress the overall market on its own .
But it could make many investors more sensitive to any other negative news in coming months , he said .
The Japan Tobacco offering has been the focus of investor attention in Tokyo since early July .
At 1 million yen a share , the total offering would be valued at $ 6.7 billion .
In recent market history , that sum would be second only to last year 's $ 11 billion sale of shares in East Japan Railway , known as JR East .
Prices in the Nikkei 225-stock average fell by a fifth last year when JR East plummeted in value after it was first offered .
Many analysts said a tumble in Japan Tobacco shares from a high offering price would likewise hurt investor confidence .
An overpriced offering also would eat into a bulging storehouse of Japanese savings that bulls hope will propel a broader market rally .
The debate about Japan Tobacco 's market value represents a twist in the conventional wisdom on recent trading in Japanese stocks .
A 20 % rally in the Nikkei so far this year is largely attributed to foreign bullishness .
Meanwhile , Japanese investors have been bearish because of the nation 's lingering economic slump .
But with Japan Tobacco , foreigners now are the bears .
They said the company , which holds an 82 % share of Japan 's booming tobacco market , will have trouble increasing earnings .
It could lose market share to imported cigarette brands , as Japanese trade barriers fall .
Its promising pharmaceutical unit , meanwhile , is years away from contributing significantly to the company 's bottom line .
Earnings per share will grow at less than 4 % for the next five years , predicted Kyoko Matsuyama , an analyst for Goldman Sachs -LRB- Japan -RRB- Ltd. .
Compared with other companies , such as Japan 's beer makers , `` That 's no growth at all , '' she said .
Goldman Sachs figures the stock is fundamentally worth about 800,000 yen .
Tokyo prices closed mixed Thursday .
London shares slipped on profit-taking and disappointment about British economic data and the German central bank 's inaction on interest rates .
World-wide , stock prices rose in dollar terms .
The Dow Jones World Stock Index was at 119.04 , up 0.48 , reflecting higher Asia\/Pacific and European markets and lower markets in the Americas .
Ship-building stocks were the top gainers in the Dow Jones World Industry Groups , closing at 126.53 , up 2.67 , or 2.2 % , with Keppel of Singapore posting a 4.4 % gain in its local currency .
Oil-drilling stocks trailed at 107.80 , down 2.03 , or 1.85 % , with Nabors Industries of the U.S. sliding 3.9 % in local currency .
In Tokyo , the Nikkei 225-stock index , which rose 38.20 points Wednesday , added 38.21 to 20862.77 .
In early trading Friday , the Nikkei index skidded 173.03 points to 20689.74 .
Thursday 's first-section volume was estimated at 250 million shares , down from 365.2 million shares a day earlier .
Losers outnumbered gainers , 505-435 .
The Tokyo Stock Price Index , or Topix , of all first-section issues , which rose 5.07 points Wednesday , eased 0.66 to 1663.09 .
Still , the performance was resilient , given a stronger Japanese yen and weak stockindex futures , which triggered arbitrage selling .
In London , the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 7.7 points to 3182.6 .
The FT 30-stock index declined 7.1 points to 2490.4 .
Volume was 674.6 million shares , compared with 764.4 million shares a day earlier .
Losses from profit-taking were compounded by weak bonds and strong British retail sales in July hinting of inflation , followed by the German Bundesbank 's leaving interest rates unchanged .
In Frankfurt , the DAX 30-stock index lost 8.73 points to 2153.56 , weakening after the Bundesbank did n't ease credit .
In Paris , shares tumbled 1.2 % under nervousness about European interest rates .
In Amsterdam , prices fell , damped by weakness in the dollar and Dutch bonds and the unchanged German rates .
In Milan , equities jumped 1.5 % on the first day of a new trading account , though dealings continued to be dominated by traders ' extremely short-term investment plays .
In Madrid , shares settled broadly lower , pressured by weakness in bond futures .
In Stockholm , prices strengthened , supported by positive corporate earnings and a sharp drop in bond yields .
In Zurich , the bourse dropped in thin trading influenced by the weak dollar and anxiety about interest rates , after disappointment with the Bundesbank .
In Brussels , equities dropped , pressured by higher bond yields , a weaker dollar and the Bundesbank 's steady policy .
In Sydney , shares rose , after a late rally prompted by a recovery in bond prices and strengthening stock-index futures , and good corporate financial reports .
In Hong Kong , stocks slipped , amid expectations that banks will increase the cost of credit , following the U.S. lead .
In Singapore , prices gained for the third straight day , paced by banking , retailing and shipyard stocks .
In Kuala Lumpur , stocks climbed broadly , boosted by sustained buoyancy on regional markets .
In Bangkok , shares advanced for the sixth consecutive session , as foreign funds poured into the market .
In Taipei , stocks retreated after the main index hit a perceived resistance point .
Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective , Geneva .
To make them directly comparable , each index , calculated in local currencies , is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100 .
The percentage change is since year-end .
THE MOVERS and shakers are becoming renters .
Some East Coast suppliers are offering companies the chance to move office possessions in rented plastic boxes rather than in purchased cardboard .
Rented plastic saves time and money and better protects contents , they say .
New York 's mov-n-Box and Rentacrate of Waltham , Mass. , lease plastic boxes that are somewhat larger than conventional cardboard ones .
They deliver the nested boxes to the moving site and remove the unpacked boxes from the new site .
Cardboard boxes come folded and must be set up and disposed of by the customer .
Mal Levy , president of mov-n-Box , says his plastic boxes are tear-and waterproof and can be stacked twice as high as cardboard .
He says his boxes can move the contents of a five-drawer filing cabinet for $ 4.25 less than cardboard over a two-week rental period .
Michael Shanley , president of Rentacrate , says plastic can move things 50 % faster than cardboard , since rental customers have an incentive to empty files faster .
Some customers bear out these claims .
Chris Domitrovich , vice president for Omnicom , says he used 600 plastic boxes recently to move the computer department of a subsidiary , BBDO , in New York .
Plastic held `` great weights without losing shape , '' he says .
Jerry Aversano , facilities manager at Societe Generale USA , says the 14,000 plastic containers he 's using to move the big insurer in New York `` do n't go flying '' off a dolly the way cardboard often does when it hits a bump .
Cardboard is n't taking this lying down .
The head of a New York paper company that sells more than a half-million cardboard boxes a year says mov-n-Box actually costs $ 7 more than cardboard to move that five-drawer file cabinet .
PANDORA 'S mailbox stands ajar .
An Indianapolis manufacturer says it has found a way around the Postal Service 's rule against advertising on mailboxes .
The prospect of millions of tiny new `` billboards '' along U.S. roads has unsettled protectors of the nation 's scenery .
Shellter , which makes mailboxes , says its only venture into `` promotional '' boxes so far involves Deere & Co. , the farm equipment company .
Shellter produced a heavy-duty plastic box in Deere 's familiar green and yellow with a small version of the company 's leaping deer logo near the rear of the tube .
The box retails for about $ 50 .
Shellter sold several hundred boxes to Deere dealers , who sold them to Deere customers .
The Postal Service is puzzled .
Months of dickering with Shellter led officials to believe that Shellter would sell the Deere boxes to the public , in which case no advertising by Deere would be involved .
If Deere buys the boxes from Shellter and sells them through its dealers , `` it 's probably advertising , '' says Jeff Zelkowitz , a Postal Service lawyer .
Shellter replies that if Deere dealers had given the boxes away , that would have been advertising , but since they sold them , it was not .
Deere indicates both motives were present .
Deere got a percentage of the mailbox sales and `` extended the equity in our brand name , '' says spokesman Bob Combs .
Shellter is flogging its mailboxes with other companies , a prospect that fills the scenery lobby with dismay .
`` If this is a loophole in the postal regulations , '' says Frank Vespe , spokesman for Scenic America , a group that fights billboards , `` I imagine it would only be a matter of time before the whole mailbox is covered with ads .
'' THE U.S. is about to start narrowing the public-toilet gap .
Starting next year , clean , safe , good-looking toilets will begin to sprout on streets and in parks in New York , San Francisco and Atlanta .
Hundreds of European cities already feature them .
In New York , Wall City Design plans to install 15 granite-clad toilets on the edges of city parks .
When a user desposits 25 cents , the doors open automatically and shut and lock behind .
Inside , soap , water and hot air are available through sensor-activated dispensers .
The toilets are accessible to wheelchairs .
If the user has n't left in 19 minutes , a signal announces that the doors will open in another minute .
When empty , the system cleans , disinfects and dries the toilet and floor .
Each toilet is connected by telephone to Wall 's central office .
Since 25 cents wo n't cover the $ 150,000 cost of each toilet plus maintenance , Wall will be allowed to sell space on two advertising pillars on adjacent streets .
In San Francisco , JCDecaux will install and maintain 20 automatic public toilets in return for the right to sell advertising on 70 newsstands and 20 kiosks .
And Atlanta has taken bids on 10 public toilets to be ready for the 1996 Summer Olympics .
PARIS -- Charles Pasqua seems to run France single-handedly these days -- and maybe the rest of the world , too .
`` Ah , the Americans are raising interest rates , '' President Francois Mitterrand exclaims to his cabinet in a front-page cartoon in Wednesday 's Le Monde .
`` Yes , '' replies Mr. Pasqua .
`` I managed to convince Clinton .
'' Of course , Mr. Pasqua , France 's interior minister , had as much to do with the Federal Reserve Board 's decision this week to raise key interest rates as Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has to do with promotions in France 's police force .
But the cartoon underscores the omnipresent role the controversial Mr. Pasqua plays on the French political scene .
With most French politicians on vacation , Mr. Pasqua is grabbing all of the headlines .
Who announced the capture this week of Carlos the Jackal , one of the world 's most wanted terrorists ?
Mr. Pasqua .
Who 's behind the crackdown in major French cities , including roadblocks and random identity checks , ostensibly to head off terrorist attacks by Algerian Islamic fundamentalists ?
Mr. Pasqua .
Who has put 26 suspected sympathizers of Algerian fundamentalists under detention without charges in a former army barracks outside Paris ?
Mr. Pasqua again .
And who , treading on the foreign minister 's turf , openly criticized the U.S. , Germany and Britain for being complacent with Algerian militants granted asylum in their countries ?
Mr. Pasqua , `` bien sur .
'' `` It 's a real Pasqua festival , '' says Romain Pache , a political analyst at the BVA polling agency .
Mr. Pasqua 's summertime activism has turned him into `` a sort of vice prime minister , '' Mr. Pache says .
And now , many suspect , he is out to parlay his popularity and success into a role as the right wing 's kingmaker in next May 's presidential elections -- unless he runs himself .
While political analysts say his chances of being elected president are remote , they say he could use the threat of running as a bargaining chip to be named prime minister if Prime Minister Edouard Balladur or Gaullist party leader Jacques Chirac are elected .
`` I honestly do n't think he will run for president unless Balladur and Chirac are in a plane crash , '' says Jean-Luc Parodi , head of the French Institute for Public Opinion .
`` But between Balladur , who has public opinion on his side , and Chirac , who has the party on his side , he 's trying to make himself count for as much as possible so that his support is indispensable to whomever he picks .
'' So far , Mr. Pasqua , who campaigned vigorously against the Maastricht treaty on European unity in 1992 , claiming it was an abdication of French sovereignty , has refused to divulge who his favored candidate is or whether he will run himself .
`` I do n't close that door , and I do n't open it either , '' he told the daily Le Figaro .
But that Mr. Pasqua could even find himself in the position of possible presidential candidate is a remarkable comeback that justifies his self-attributed title as `` the king of trampoline .
'' Indeed , for the 67-year-old Mr. Pasqua -- who before entering politics was a door-to-door salesman of Pastis , a licorice-tasting aperitif popular in Southern France -- being what the weekly Le Nouvel Observateur calls `` the most courted man in France '' is sweet revenge .
Mr. Pasqua 's past as an organizer of a parallel Gaullist security force in the 1960s had earned him a reputation as a shadowy political operator that he never really shook off , even after a long stint as a senator .
When Mr. Chirac , prime minister from 1986 to 1988 , gave him the unpopular job of interior minister with the task of reversing what the French call `` insecurity , '' Mr. Pasqua came out swinging .
`` Insecurity will change camps , '' he proclaimed .
`` We will terrorize the terrorists .
'' Mr. Pasqua had to eat his words .
Paris was rocked by a wave of terrorist bombs and assassinations of businessmen , and three youths were killed by policemen in separate incidents .
Mr. Pasqua quickly became the government 's most unpopular minister , students marched to demand his resignation and the weekly L'Evenement du Jeudi named him `` the zero of 1986 .
'' But in an incredible string of good luck , Mr. Pasqua 's police force arrested all of the top leaders of the Action Directe terrorist group and dismantled a pro-Iranian terrorist group that had planted several deadly bombs .
Meanwhile , behind-the-scene efforts by allies of Mr. Pasqua led to the release of all 10 French hostages in Lebanon .
This was n't enough to get Mr. Chirac elected president in 1988 , but it earned Mr. Pasqua a reputation as an efficient interior minister .
`` The improvement in the interior minister 's image is spectacular , '' BVA noted in a 1993 study .
Reappointed to that post in 1993 when the right was swept back into power , Mr. Pasqua has now topped these exploits with the capture of Carlos , one of the world 's most feared terrorists even though he has been in semiretirement for a decade .
Mr. Pasqua insists no deals were cut .
But the daily Liberation says France gave Sudan satellite photos allowing it to locate the positions of rebel soldiers in southern Sudan , and has used its influence to allow Sudanese troops to transit the Central African Republic , a former French colony , to attack the rebels .
Mr. Pasqua refuses to explain how Carlos was arrested and how he was turned over to the French , claiming it is a defense secret .
But one of Carlos 's lawyers , Mourad Oussedik , claims the terrorist was kidnapped and drugged before being turned over to France 's counterintelligence service .
Similarly , Mr. Pasqua is drawing fire over strong-arm tactics in France to head off possible terrorist attacks by Algerian fundamentalists angry at France 's support of the military government in Algiers .
In a radio interview yesterday , the Socialist Party leader , Henri Emmanuelli , said Mr. Pasqua 's security crackdown was a public-relations effort designed to lull the French into a false sense of security .
`` Every time a presidential election approaches , the volume of Pasqua-esque gesticulation increases , '' Mr. Emmanuelli said .
Civil-rights groups also say that singling out North African immigrants in security checks makes all Arabs or Muslims feel like `` a potential terrorist .
'' But Mr. Pasqua , knowing that his current high standing in opinion polls is due mainly to his tough talk and shows of force , vows to continue the crackdown .
`` You do n't catch any fish if you do n't go fishing , '' he says .
NEW YORK -- Volatility ahead of today 's options expirations , profit-taking in the technology sector and a slumping bond market led to a modest pullback for small-company stocks .
Prices swung in a narrow range between positive and negative territory as investors geared up for the `` double witching '' session today .
`` There 's some skittishness as a result of tomorrow , '' Leslie Seff , head of Nasdaq trading at Wagner Stott & Co. , said yesterday .
`` I 've seen profit-taking , and I 've also seen some aggressive selling .
'' Most of the selling was confined to the tech group , which had rallied sharply for the past two days , ever since the Federal Reserve 's move Tuesday to boost shortterm interest rates .
Other stocks moved mainly on individual news yesterday , traders said .
A shaky session for the bond market provided more basis for the decline in equity prices .

`` We 're pretty overbought , '' Mr. Kuhn said .

'' GROUP TECHNOLOGIES Corp. -LRB- Tampa , Fla. -RRB- -- Henry F. Frigon , 59 years old , and Sidney R. Petersen , 64 , were named directors of this electronics manufacturer , expanding the board to five .

LUDWIGSHAFEN , Germany -- German chemicals-producer BASF AG reported a 36 % jump in second-quarter pretax group profit , to 334 million marks -LRB- $ 215.3 million -RRB- .
The company , one of Germany 's three big chemical concerns , said the period compares favorably with 1993 , `` the most difficult year to date for BASF .
'' First-half pretax profit rose 41 % to 683 million marks from 483 million marks .
Rising exports boosted BASF 's sales and helped overcome weak business at home in Germany .
Groupwide sales climbed 7 % in the first half to 23.09 billion marks from 21.56 billion marks a year earlier .
For the second quarter , sales rose 9.6 % to 11.82 billion marks from 10.78 billion marks a year earlier .
But BASF said low prices continued to plague business , adding that the rise in sales reflected an increase in volume , rather than a change in prices .
The results were at the low end of expectations , and in Frankfurt stock trading , BASF slipped 3.2 marks to 326.50 marks .
In Germany alone , sales in the second quarter fell 1.2 % to 2.97 billion marks .
Exports , however , grew 13 % in the threemonth period to 8.1 billion marks .
In the first six months , domestic sales fell by a more pronounced 2.3 % to 5.96 billion marks , while group exports in the first half rose 10 % , the company said .
Business owners are turning the surge in cut-rate credit cards into a big source of company financing .
Consider Thespine Kavoulakis .
As owner of a Pittsburgh chemical-testing concern , she has had three business-loan applications rejected .
But as a consumer , she has lenders stuffing her mailbox with enticements to borrow .
`` They keep mailing me offers and I keep taking them , '' she says .
Since last fall Ms. Kavoulakis has used cash advances from four credit cards with a combined credit line of more than $ 20,000 to buy supplies and equipment and even pay the three employees of Alkav Analytical Laboratories Inc. .
Her current total credit-card balance of $ 15,000 accounts for three-quarters of Alkav 's debt , she says .
Entrepreneurs have long used credit cards to scrape together enough cash for their start-ups .
But now many going concerns are using credit-card debt -- which at 8 % or 9 % for some cards is comparable to commercial-loan interest rates -- to pay their expenses .
Fierce competition among credit-card issuers spurs the trend , enabling some industrious entrepreneurs to patch together as much as $ 100,000 in business financing through Visa and MasterCard .
Some 26 % of the owners of small and midsize businesses are using credit cards to fund their companies , up from 16 % a year ago , according to a recent survey of 750 owners by Arthur Andersen and National Small Business United , a trade association .
The survey , conducted annually , showed that credit-card debt has leaped ahead of private loans and vendor credit to become the third most popular source of financing .
It trailed only bank loans and business earnings .
And even though the Federal Reserve pushed up short-term interest rates this week , the trend is n't expected to slow , says Ronald Cohen , a Cleveland accountant and president of National Small Business United , which represents 65,000 businesses .
`` A lot of small-business owners do n't mind higher rates as long as they can borrow .
'' Indeed , one of Ms. Kavoulakis 's credit cards has an 18 % interest rate .
`` I do n't look at the credit cards as debt , '' she says .
`` I look at them as buying time .
'' Of course , credit-card borrowing is not without risk .
Lacking the personal relationships fostered by conventional business loans , a card issuer is less likely than a commercial lender to work out debt-repayment problems , says Craig Isom , an Arthur Andersen partner in Woodland Hills , Calif. `` When you get into trouble , they just pull the card , '' he says .
Business owners such as Gerard Thibodeau say they would happily trade in their cards for a regular loan -- if they could .
Mr. Thibodeau and his wife own J&C Creative Designs , a jewelry retailer with stores in Orange and Villa Park , Calif. , and annual sales of $ 350,000 .
But the Californians still rely on six personal credit cards -- including two issued by banks that rejected them for commercial loans -- to cover shortages in working capital , Mr. Thibodeau says .
`` I am just sick and tired of these cards , '' Mr. Thibodeau says .
`` I need something that makes more sense than three , four or five different $ 7,000 lines of credit .
'' Some states require credit-card issuers to specify that personal cards be used only for personal expenses , though enforcement is rare .
As a result , business owners usually assemble their credit-card financing without revealing their intentions .
`` We get calls all the time from people who present themselves as consumers looking for cards with high credit limits and low interest rates , '' says Robert McKinley , president of Ram Research Corp. , a Frederick , Md. , company that provides consumers with information about the best deals in the bank-card industry .
`` After you talk with them for a while , you realize they 're business owners looking to cover shortages '' in their cash flow .
The truth is , however , credit-card companies do n't seem to mind .
Commercial banks and other lenders that issue cards `` are essentially indifferent to how or when your use them , '' says Richard Hagadorn , an executive vice president at Visa International , which like rival MasterCard International has stepped up efforts to market corporate cards directly to small businesses .
With business owners not saying how they 'll use their new credit cards and issuers not asking , it is difficult to determine how much personal credit cards used for business financing account for the growth in credit-card debt .
The Federal Reserve estimates this debt rose to $ 312.6 billion in June , up nearly 16 % from a year earlier .
Yet any contribution at all is good news for the economy , says James Chessen , chief economist for the American Bankers Association .
That 's because the the use of a credit card for business financing theoretically gives back more to the economy than the purchase of consumer items .
Mr. Chessen says credit cards have always been popular among borrowers who do n't qualify for a business loan .
Indeed , the ABA has often argued that regulatory reporting of commercial and industrial loans overlooks financing through credit cards , home-equity loans and other unconventional banking sources .
But the availability of such cheap credit-card financing may be leading some qualified borrowers to neglect seeking conventional loans , he says .
However irresistible the flood of credit-card offers may seem , business owners still `` need to shop around for best lending terms and conditions , '' Mr. Chessen says .
Lending competition is fierce today , he maintains , `` There are certainly a lot of banks out there anxious to provide funding .
'' NEW YORK -- When an antique-stock dealer recently auctioned an original Standard Oil Co. certificate signed by John D. Rockefeller , the 1875 artifact fetched $ 8,500 from Daniel Luchansky .
Mr. Luchansky , a collector of old stock and bond certificates for 20 years , did n't hesitate to bid on the trading instrument .
`` I think it 's the best .
It 's pretty much the premier piece in stock collecting , '' Mr. Luchansky said , adding that the certificate normally sells for about $ 13,000 .
`` Mine is No. 13 ... and there were only about 300 of them ever printed .
'' Mr. Luchansky , 35 years old , is part of a small but growing band of people nationwide for whom amassing rare stocks , bonds and other pre-World War II financial memorabilia is a passionate hobby .
Dealers and auctioneers estimate that about 10,000 people in the U.S. , many of them Wall Street professionals , are active collectors of antique financial treasures ranging from certificates to property deeds to old paper currency .
Small wonder then that Mr. Luchansky , besides being an avid collector -- he admits that his home has become overcrowded because his $ 100,000 collection is `` kind of equivalent to a small museum '' -- also is a portfolio manager at Merrill Lynch & Co. .
But antique-stock collectors hope to spread the word to the general public .
They say no matter what an individual 's personal or professional interests , chances are there is some related stock beckoning to be framed or put in a collector 's album .
Got a penchant for entertainment ?
Then try getting your hands on an authentic Walt Disney Co. certificate or a certificate signed by Charlie Chaplin when he headed Chaplin Studios , collectors said .
For sports fans , owning a trading document signed by legendary baseball player Tris Speaker might entitle you to some serious bragging rights .
But the most sought-after antique certificates were n't signed by athletes or Hollywood celebrities .
They were issued by railroads , oil companies and insurance firms .
Experts attribute their popularity to collectors ' identifying with the companies and people who helped shape America 's industrial age .
`` Entrepreneurial people are particularly attracted to them , because they ` re relics of a time when you started up your own business , '' collector Richard Urmston said .
He owns Centennial Documents , a Clinton , N.J. , company he opened in 1981 to sell historic stocks and other financial Americana .
When Mr. Urmston started his firm , inflation was out of control , the prime rate was 21.5 % and `` people were dumping all of their cash and wanted to get their money into anything collectible , '' he said .
`` A lot of people came from stamp and coin collecting .
But now they 've been priced out of those markets .
The good material is all gone or it 's in museums or special collections .
'' Mr. Urmston said that because antique-stock collecting is `` still in its early stages , '' bargains abound .
Mr. Luchansky , the Merrill Lynch portfolio manager , agreed .
He said buying top-notch items in traditional areas of collectibles can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars .
With antique-stock collecting , however , `` you can own a piece of history for a fraction of the cost that people pay for the world 's best stamps , coins or even baseball cards , '' he said .
`` To me , that indicates a good relative value .
The only place that 's cheaper for the little guy to play is newspapers .
'' However , he does n't recommend antique-stock collecting as a financial investment .
Instead , he urges would-be collectors to find good-value items and `` just buy the stuff because you love it .
'' Experts said the value of stock and bond certificates is determined in several ways .
Of primary concern is whether the issue bears the signature of someone famous .
The age of the document and the prominence of the company that issued the certificate also are important .
If a stock is n't signed by a high-profile person or issued by a well-known firm , how ornate the instrument is and its overall condition can influence value .
A decorative , well-preserved certificate obviously will be worth more than a tattered , wrinkled certificate with holes , dealers said .
R.M. Smythe & Co. of New York is among the largest of the country 's 40 or so auction houses and dealers in the business .
The firm buys , sells , researches and appraises antique stocks , bonds and related financial items .
The company also sponsors an annual auction in Lancaster , Pa. , featuring vintage stocks and bonds .
Recent certificates have sold for anywhere from $ 10 to just under $ 10,000 .
Stephen Goldsmith , vice president of R.M. Smythe , said industry trade publications estimate a world-wide market of $ 17 million for antique stock and financial memorabilia .
`` It 's not a big hobby , but it certainly is growing , '' he said .
Centennial Documents ' Mr. Urmston feels like his business is as much play as it is work .
He became animated when describing a planned trip to Germany , where he will sell antique stocks .
`` I 'll probably be talking about these old certificates the whole time , '' he said laughing .
`` We 're just like little kids when it comes to this stuff .
'' NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group said it will remove Dreyfus Corp. from the S&P MidCap 400 Index after the close of trading Wednesday .
Dreyfus is expected to be merged into Mellon Bank Corp. , of Pittsburgh , next week .
The rating agency also said the New York Stock Exchange plans to suspend trading in Dreyfus common shares on Thursday .
Replacing Dreyfus in the index is Olsten Corp. , Westbury , N.Y. , a supplier of temporary office , factory and health-care personnel .
The Aug. 8 opinion piece , `` Consumers Union Credibility -- Good but Slipping , '' by Larry Katzenstein was misleading , uninformed and unfair .
It badly misstated our position on recombinant bovine growth hormone -LRB- rbGH , also known as BST -RRB- and confused issues of product quality with potential health implications .
Consumers Union 's efforts have focused on labeling issues : We believe milk from rbGH-treated cows is different enough that it should be labeled as such .
Mr. Katzenstein 's piece ignored that vital context .
Monsanto , which manufactures rbGH , has claimed that there is no difference between milk from cows treated with the hormone and milk from untreated cows .
But Monsanto 's data show that milk from treated cows has , on average , a higher-than-normal level of white blood cells , which are a sign of pus .
Mr. Katzenstein distorted our position on this issue : We do not contend that a high white-cell count poses a health hazard .
But it can give milk an off-taste and shortens its shelf life .
There are also unanswered questions about the safety of rbGH use .
It is widely recognized that cows treated with rbGH get more udder infections -LRB- mastitis -RRB- .
Farmers commonly treat the infections with antibiotics , potentially increasing antibiotic residues in the milk .
The label which , by law , is distributed with rbGH states that `` Cows injected with POSILAC -LRB- Monsanto 's brand name for rbGH -RRB- are at an increased risk for clinical mastitis -LRB- visibly abnormal milk -RRB- '' and `` Use of POSILAC is associated with increased frequency of use of medication in cows for mastitis and other health problems .
The use of rbGH offers no benefits to consumers .
Even though milk production will be increased , milk prices will not be decreased .
Instead , the federal government has projected a $ 500 million increase in the cost of the dairy price support program , which purchases all surplus dairy products .
Given the potential adverse economic consequences and the concern about increased antibiotic residues , consumers have -- at the very least -- the right to know whether their milk comes from cows treated with rbGH .
Over the years , Consumers Union has built its credibility in many ways , including advocating the consumer 's right to know .
That 's why we 've actively supported labeling milk .
Given Mr. Katzenstein 's past employment at CU , we ` re disappointed to find not a word of that basic consumerist and journalistic principle in his article .

LONDON -- After lots of talk , Hanson PLC is showing some action .
Analysts who have been predicting an imminent turnaround in the Anglo-American company 's prospects for the last two years finally got satisfaction this week when the conglomerate posted a healthy 10 % rise in third-quarter pretax profit .
The earnings increase was in line with most forecasts .
But analysts noted that increases are accelerating as the company rides economic recovery in the U.S. and , to a lesser extent , the United Kingdom .
Such visible progress is a relief to those who have been predicting a Hanson rebound since the U.S. economy started showing signs of growth a year or so ago .
Next year , some analysts believe the group 's earnings could rise a whopping 30 % , more than double the increase predicted for U.K. companies as a group .
`` Some Hanson businesses are really starting to run quite fast , '' says one U.K. analyst .
For instance , the acquisition last year of Quantum , a U.S. chemical company , appears to have been timed just right : Only since April have big price increases in polyethylene stuck .
So why are n't more analysts bullish on the stock ?
With a price\/earnings ratio of about 18.8 based on projected 1994 earnings , `` Hanson is pretty much fairly valued at the moment , '' says Ian Hilliker of NatWest Securities .
`` And there 's nothing in the figures to produce any real excitement .
'' That ratio will decline to about 14.6 times forecast 1995 earnings next year , says Andrew Mitchell of Smith New Court , but whether that makes Hanson stock a buy is n't clear .
`` You might say our view is broadly neutral , '' says Mr. Mitchell .
A year ago , Hanson traded at a discount to the market .
Now , it 's trading at about a 19 % premium .
`` The problem is deciding what the correct level is , '' Mr. Mitchell says .
When Hanson was in the doldrums , it was easy to recommend the stock .
Its boring , cyclical businesses of coal , aggregates , bricks and chemicals were bound to look up sharply once recovery took hold .
Now that last year 's coal strike has been settled and Quantum is making earnings leaps , predictions of big increases are coming true .
Indeed , Jack Kelly of Goldman Sachs in New York has had Hanson on his buy list for two years .
`` The turnaround in earnings took longer than we thought , '' says Mr. Kelly .
`` The basis for our recommendation is we think Hanson has very substantial earnings power as the U.S. economy continues its recovery .
If you look at the third quarter , it was the best quarter since late 1992 .
It was an up quarter without the benefit of any capital gains .
'' That change may be more significant than it looks .
During Hanson 's heyday , when Lords Hanson and White ran it full time , the group 's business was largely one of buying whole companies low and selling them high .
Now with Derek Bonham at the helm in the U.K. and David Clarke running the U.S. businesses , that strategy has shifted .
Businesses that do n't follow predictable economic cycles are being shucked .
Acquisitions are n't the big , bold transformations of old , but `` bolt-ons '' to existing businesses .
The Hanson story is less one of splashy acquisitions and more one of cyclical businesses recovering with the economy .
Such lack of excitement may be one reason why the stock barely budged when earnings were released on Tuesday .
In London on Wednesday , the shares dropped 2.5 pence to close at 261.5 pence -LRB- $ 4.02 -RRB- while the market rose , analysts said , because large Hanson shareholders decided to take profits .
But if the market thinks Hanson is less exciting , its executives feel otherwise .
The company is pursuing a `` twin strategy , '' says Christopher Collins , director of corporate development .
`` We are prepared to make a major acquisition when the opportunity presents itself , provided we are comfortable it is the sort of business we could manage , '' says Mr. Collins .
`` We have liked businesses that are basic .
We do n't like high-tech businesses with uncertain rates of change .
'' SAN FRANCISCO -- Dominico Julian is a pacifist and a vegetarian who does n't approve of violent television shows .
Yet he has spent much of the summer building a device that shoots spikes and wields a metal cutting saw , hoping it will destroy all challengers .
His creation will be one of 17 expected entries in the First Annual International Robot Wars , a competition to be held in an indoor arena on a former military base here tomorrow .
Radio-controlled robots will compete in three events of escalating degrees of violence : the `` Escort '' competition , in which contestant robots must defend a helpless drone from destruction by a bigger robot ; the `` Face-Off , '' when two robots fight until one is disabled ; and the `` Melee , '' a free-for-all where all contestants try to crush one another .
Mr. Julian and his partner , Patrick Campbell , who just completed a master 's degree in robotics at Stanford University , have spent about $ 1,000 and as many as 14 hours a day on their robot .
`` Humans are naturally violent , '' says Mr. Julian , a construction worker , `` so this is a perfect outlet .
If we can use machines '' to settle disputes , he says , `` this could be a very viable solution '' to social problems .
The event was dreamed up by toy designer Marc Thorpe , who spent 12 years creating models for such films as the `` Indiana Jones '' movies and `` Star Wars : Return of the Jedi .
'' When a robot vacuum cleaner he was designing failed , he decided to remove the vacuum mechanism and arm the robot with a chain saw instead .
`` People are fascinated by conflict , '' he says .
`` This is for people who like conflict , without destroying people .
'' Organizers of the robot rivalry specify that `` explosives , acid , untethered projectiles , flames and lasers '' are prohibited .
In case bits of metal fly about , members of the audience will be given safety glasses .
Robots will compete in three different weight classes .
Samuel Addison-Muncy , an artist living in Cambria , Calif. , will enter a small robot in the lightweight class -LRB- 10 to 40 pounds -RRB- .
He says his robot is made from a `` toy dune buggy chassis , with a giant steel dome .
It looks like one of Madonna 's bustier cups .
'' Some opponents in the heavyweight class -LRB- 70 to 110 pounds -RRB- are more formidable .
A group from Madison , Wis. , built a 70-pound robot named X-1 that is `` so dangerous my neighbors wo n't come near my house any more , '' says Mike Winter , a software designer .
`` I wo n't stand near my own robot .
'' Not wanting to divulge competitive secrets , he wo n't offer many details other than to say the robot has a steel spike and goes 20 miles an hour .
His team tested X-1 by driving it over curbs , smashing it into concrete walls and letting it chase a toy train .
`` It tears down after it , flings it into the air and stabs it , '' Mr. Winter says proudly .
In one flubbed test , the team lost control of the robot , which came within an inch of ramming its spike through a neighbor 's garage door , stopping only when tackled by one of its designers .
Although Mr. Winter says he does n't think the Robot Wars will get out of hand , he is concerned about what will happen after the event .
`` We 're not going to want to stop our robots , '' he says .
`` We 're going to want to do a tour of San Francisco , and maybe take over a bridge .
'' NEW YORK -- Jerry Petrillo 's pastor made the introduction that landed him an interview for his first job on Wall Street .
A year out of high school in 1950 , he went to work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as a runner , chucking any thoughts of becoming a dockworker like his father .
It was n't a glamorous job ; runners are gofers who deliver slips of paper around the exchange for brokers .
But it was a lucky break for a young man who grew up in the Manhattan neighborhood called Hell 's Kitchen , the son of two Italian immigrants .
From runner , Mr. Petrillo worked his way up the ranks .
In a year , he moved up a step to a position called reporter .
After a stint in the Korean War , he became a clerk .
From there , he bought a seat on the exchange and spent the next 25 years as a floor broker .
When he retired in March , he was general partner at a firm called Exeter Ltd. , buying and selling stock for some of the biggest names in the securities business , from Goldman Sachs & Co. to Lehman Brothers , he said .
`` It 's a good American story .
You start from nowhere and hope to get someplace , '' Mr. Petrillo said last week from his home , on a golf course on Long Island .
The starting place for Mr. Petrillo is one shared by many people over the years .
Scores of brokers have used the job of runner , also called page or squad , as a first step toward success .
But that common career path is dying .
A new generation of technology being introduced on the New York Stock Exchange will make runners obsolete within two years .
An official of the exchange said its 140 runners will be eliminated , replaced by cellular telephones and hand-held computers .
The phase-out already has begun .
Anticipating the changes , the exchange lately has hired temporary workers to fill runners ' jobs as they open , said Catherine Kinney , a Big Board executive vice president .
Now , only half of all runners are regular employees .
Facing competition from electronic trading rivals , such as the Nasdaq Stock Market and brokerage-run trading systems , the exchange has turned to cutting-edge technology to improve its efficiency and appeal among customers .
It 's partway through a $ 125 million , two-year effort to upgrade its communications and computer systems .
The latest technology expenses are on top of $ 1 billion spent on automation in the previous 12 years .
Because of those investments , the Big Board 's daily trading capacity has ballooned to 1.4 billion shares , more than double the level of its busiest day ever , Oct. 20 , 1987 , a day after the Black Monday crash .
But new technologies often have human costs as well .
Since 1988 , the exchange 's operations staff has shrunk to 500 from 800 because of efforts to improve efficiency and implement new technology , said Richard Grasso , exchange president .
Runners who remain on staff when the last of those positions are eliminated are expected to be retrained and reassigned , rather than laid off , Ms. Kinney said .
Mr. Grasso said the overall operations head count is n't expected to fall below 500 .
The Big Board 's runners are among the last on Wall Street .
For every broker who got a start as a page boy on the exchange floor , there are many others who worked directly for brokerage firms , rushing trading information from building to building in the financial district .
Those runners were replaced by modern communications equipment years ago .
The disappearance of Big Board runners does n't signal the end to a Wall Street career path for those of modest means .
In fact , the route followed by Mr. Petrillo and others of his era already has changed and narrowed considerably .
Education has become increasingly important in landing a job and gaining promotions .
Today , for instance , it is rare for clerks not to have a college education , people who work at the exchange said .
But Mr. Petrillo still sees considerable value in hands-on experience .
And he predicts that brokerage firms or the exchange will be forced to spend more time training the college graduates they hire once they no longer have the runner positions to use as a proving ground .
The experiences runners gain today are little different from those Mr. Petrillo had 44 years ago , when he started at $ 26 a week .
Then , like now , runners would rush buy and sell orders from brokerage stations at the sides of the floor to groups of traders congregated in the middle .
When a trade was done , the broker would yell `` squad '' -- short for message squad -- and a confirmation would be rushed to the broker station and customer .
The biggest change has been the pace of the work .
In Mr. Petrillo 's day , at slow times , runners would take to the street to play stickball .
That 's not a likely occurrence today , when trading volume averages nearly 300 million shares daily .
VISION-SCIENCES Inc. -LRB- Natick , Mass. -RRB- -- This maker of infection-control products for endoscopy named Edward Benecke , a retired vice president of Johnson & Johnson , a director , expanding the board to seven members .
TOKYO -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Toshiba Corp. plans to shift production of North America-bound television parts to Mexico from Singapore by next summer , a company spokeswoman said .
The move is aimed at taking advantage of provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement , which eliminated or reduced tariffs on products traded between Canada , Mexico and the U.S. About 1.4 million television chassis , or frames , will be produced in Mexico , compared with the current one million , the electronics company said .
The televisions are assembled at a U.S. plant in Tennessee .
The same parts , if produced in Singapore , would be subject to customs duty as they entered North America .
Resulting excess capacity in Singapore will be shifted to televison assembly for other markets .
TOKYO -- Three Japanese major trading houses -- Itochu Corp. , Nissho Iwai Corp. and Mitsubishi Corp. -- signed a pact to lease a total of five airplanes to Spain 's state-owned Iberia Air Lines over five years .
In a joint press release , the three companies said the contract involves five Boeing 757-200 planes , with a combined value of 23.5 billion yen -LRB- $ 234.5 million -RRB- .
Under the so-called operating lease pact , the three trading houses will have options of either selling the planes or securing another leasing contract when the five-year pact with Iberia expires .
The trading houses have each set up an airplane leasing company in Dublin .
Through those subsidiaries , Itochu and Nissho leased two planes each and Mitsubishi leased one to Iberia .
The companies said they might be able to reap large capital gains from selling the planes , depending on the condition of the second-hand airplane market .
The leasing pact has enabled the Spanish airline to expand its fleet without putting further strain on its already suffering balance sheet , the three companies said .
WASHINGTON -- President Clinton and House Democratic leaders bowed to Republicans with a proposal to slash about $ 3.5 billion from the anticrime legislation , in a desperate attempt to pass the troubled bill .
Other types and sizes of reductions are possible , officials said .
But House Democratic leaders left a White House meeting with the president last evening determined to test how many votes the 10 % across-the-board cut might produce .
The move seemed to provide the brightest prospect for the White House to reverse the embarrassing defeat it suffered last week , when the House refused to consider the measure by a vote of 225-210 .
The initial response from Republicans last night was that the White House , finally , was moving in their direction .
Last night , Mr. Gingrich and Minority Leader Robert Michel -LRB- R. , Ill. -RRB- huddled with Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington and other Democratic leaders , in an effort to hammer out a deal .
This afternoon , Mr. Clinton plans to hold a news conference at which the crime bill will certainly be a major topic .
Clearly , the White House has decided to target a group of about 35 to 40 Republicans who have shown a willingness to support a less-costly crime bill that retains the ban on assault weapons .
But the move comes with risks : Some Democrats , particularly members of the Congressional Black Caucus , may now balk at the bill if billions of dollars are cut from the crime-prevention programs .
Nevertheless , the White House had little choice but to seek GOP support after it failed to find enough Democratic votes .
Still , there was some optimism by Democrats that they could hold the line .
Although the cuts would be much deeper than Democrats had publicly considered previously , Rep. Charles Schumer -LRB- D. , N.Y. -RRB- , chairman of the House subcommittee on crime , said , `` the fairness of the proposal will minimize losses on the Democratic side .
'' But far more than the crime bill is at stake in this effort .
The White House recognizes that , if the president can strike a deal with the Republicans on the anticrime measure , it would boost bipartisan relations and perhaps improve the climate for his No. 1 priority : health-care legislation .
By contrast , a crime-bill victory without the Republicans would have little lasting impact on the president 's ability to move other major legislation .
The concession is a long step toward the Republicans , who have been campaigning to remove `` pork '' from the $ 33 billion crime legislation .
Republicans have been pushing the president to slice between $ 1 billion and $ 5.5 billion from the measure .
The Democrats also were moving toward altering some of the bill 's provisions in ways Republicans prefer .
For instance , the Democrats would accede to a provision that would provide for notification of a community when a convicted violent sexual offender is released from prison to its area .
The Democrats also would permit Congress to review any assault weapons that an agency of the government might seek to ban in the future .
Democrats today plan to check how many votes a slimmed-down crime measure would attract , and to vote soon -- perhaps over the weekend -- to revive the legislation if a majority were found for it .
The House Democratic leaders tried a variety of options before settling on the strategy of an across-the-board cut .
At first , they and the president assaulted the Republicans and called them the tools of special interests .
Their leading option was to bring up the original bill again , and try to switch eight votes to get it to the floor .
Then they thought about dropping the assault-weapons ban , as the National Rifle Association wanted .
But President Clinton rejected that route .
So , in the end , the Democrats decided to bow to their initial nemesis , the Republicans , in the hope the GOP will provide enough votes to keep the Clinton priority alive .
The 10 % - cutback proposal was fashioned by Mr. Schumer and Rep. Michael Castle -LRB- R. , Del. -RRB- , who previously worked with each other on gun-control issues .
Mr. Castle voted against consideration of the bill .
The seeds for the latest proposal were planted yesterday morning when White House aides George Stephanopoulos and Pat Griffin met with Republicans on Capitol Hill .
That plan includes funding some prevention programs in a block grant , a mechanism that Republicans say would give local authorities more discretion while cutting federal red tape .
The proposal would limit crime-bill funding to the amount contained in a planned $ 30 billion trust fund , financed by reductions in the federal payroll .

HELSINKI , Finland -- For most of the past half-century , Oy Nokia established this city as one of the great toilet-paper capitals of the world .
Now , it 's hoping to do the same with cellular phones .
The company , with headquarters less than a two-hour flight from the Arctic Circle , has shed its paper-and-rubber-galoshes past and emerged in the past year as a high-tech superpower .
Nokia now ranks second in the world in the production of mobile phones , behind Motorola Inc. of the U.S. On its home turf in Europe , Nokia will end this year as the market leader .
The image of shopkeepers in Venice or accountants in El Paso clutching a phone made in the land of reindeer and saunas may seem wacky .
But at a time when technology is forcing companies across the globe to adjust or die , Nokia is an important example of a smokestack company that has fought its way out of its old skin .
By shaking up its corporate culture and venturing aggressively outside its home turf , Nokia has replaced the conglomerate 's fuzziness with a sharp focus .
`` They set out to build a new industry for themselves , and that 's what they 've done , '' says Herschel Shosteck , a cellular-industry analyst in Silver Spring , Md. .
For all Nokia 's improvements , though , analysts are still cautious about declaring the company a sure-bet success .
In the U.S. , for instance , Nokia is running a distant second to Motorola in cellular phones , with market share of 20 % compared with its rival 's 40 % , and is showing few signs of catching up .
In that market -- the biggest in the world -- Nokia continues to suffer from a lousy distribution system and a Japanese-sounding name that has left its image muddled .
`` If 4 % of the people knew the Nokia name , I would be surprised , '' says Mike Biety , vice president of Peak Barr Petralia Biety , a Tampa , Fla. , advertising agency that last month launched Nokia 's biggest TV ad campaign ever .
`` It 's going to take a lot of time , and we 'll have to stay at it and at it and at it .
'' Still , nobody can argue with Nokia 's showing so far .
For the first four months of the year , Nokia 's net income rocketed to 752 million markkaa -LRB- $ 146.1 million -RRB- from 56 million markkaa a year earlier .
The jump reflects both the high margins of its blossoming mobile-phone business and the large restructuring costs that hurt the year-earlier figure .
Sales increased about 20 % to 8.5 billion markkaa .
Last month , hoping to cash in on some of that success , Nokia completed a $ 480 million preferred-stock offering and became the first Finnish company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange .
The U.S. shares , which began trading July 1 at $ 40.375 , so far have risen about 28 % .
Yesterday , the American depositary receipts closed at $ 51.75 , up $ 2.625 , or 5.3 % , in composite trading .
Although Nokia 's base in Finland may seem far away , its location actually has worked to the company 's advantage .
Whether it 's because of the huge , snowbound distances , or because of the telephone 's role as a tool of resistance against the czar , Finland always has been one of the most open phone markets in the world .
By the time Finland won its independence in 1917 , hundreds of phone lines had been strung , willy-nilly , throughout the country .
That , in turn , translated into dozens of different phone companies -- and phone-company suppliers -- and the situation has held ever since .
These days , Finland has more mobile phone users per capita than any other country , with 10 % of the population using the phones , compared with 6 % in the U.S. , 3.5 % in Britain and just over 1 % in France .
The legacy of competition also has meant that Finland , along with its Scandinavian cousins , Sweden and Denmark , were the first to adopt a mobile-phone standard and have been among the earliest to make the switch from analog to the more data-friendly digital systems .
Nokia is banking that as more of the world converts to digital networks , those numbers will continue to rise .
`` Nokia seems to be diving into this digital business feet first and with very big boots , '' says Iain Gillott , wireless research manager at International Data Corp. , a Framingham , Mass. , market-research consulting company .
While Mr. Gillott 's notion of Nokia as a technological powerhouse is n't unique now , it would have been almost laughable two years ago .
Then , Chief Executive Jorma Ollila inherited a company that was hardly a force in anything at all .
In 1992 , Nokia was a mish-mash , making galoshes and tires for heavy trucks , supplying electricity and natural gas , and managing a string of cable factories in Eastern Europe .
Even worse , the company 's former management , sensing that these businesses were n't going to grow , went on a buying spree in the 1980s to win Nokia a place in the electronics business .
But the deals were duds .
Nokia -- knowing nothing about computers or consumer electronics -- bought a bleeding computer business from Sweden 's LM Ericsson and a TV , stereo and clock business from a German company that had $ 173 million in operating losses the year before Nokia bought it .
By the time Mr. Ollila arrived in the top job in early 1992 following a reshuffling , Nokia 's alliances in consumer electronics were drawing serious blood .
Operating profit tumbled from 969 million markkaa in 1990 to a loss of 81 million markkaa in 1991 .
Immediately after his arrival , Mr. Ollila began a complete restructuring of the consumer-electronics business , cutting more than 1,000 jobs and bailing out of the dying picture-tube business .
More important , Mr. Ollila , a 44-year-old former Citibank executive , began an effort to redirect Nokia 's strategy and culture .
He poured money and people into the mobile-phone and phone-systems businesses and sought to take the entrepreneurial , high-tech culture that had always been alive in pockets of Nokia and apply them to the company as a whole .
His next step was to oust the old guard .
Mr. Ollila plucked from inside Nokia a group of younger new managers and wiped out two layers of management .
The average age of Nokia 's top brass dropped by 10 years overnight .
While much of the recent success of Nokia 's telecommunications business is due to the fact that it is playing in a world market that is growing by 50 % a year , analysts also give Mr. Ollila 's revamping some of the credit .
The percentage of Nokia 's revenue from phone-related businesses totaled 45 % last year -- up from 12 % four years ago -- and accounted for nearly all of the company 's 1993 operating profit .
At Nokia headquarters -- inside an old Helsinki bank building and up a rickety caged elevator -- the plan , then , is to continue to focus on phones and to build on Nokia 's digital expertise .
OPORTO , Portugal -- When Joao Oliveira celebrated his 35th anniversary at Portugal 's largest commercial bank , Banco Portugues do Atlantico , earlier this month , it was an occasion for congratulations -- and some tears .
Through a series of acquisitions , he built BPA into a financial group with interests stretching from insurance to real estate .
But for the 58-year-old BPA chairman , it was no time for self-puffery .
`` We are at war , '' he told colleagues .
BPA had become the target of Portugal 's first hostile takeover bid , a 132 billion escudo -LRB- $ 827 million -RRB- offer from upstart rival Banco Comercial Portugues .
The struggle pits one of Porugal 's most efficient banks against a sleepy , formerly state-owned institution and a shareholder group that is out to protect its cozy business relationships .
The outcome could set the course of Portugal 's economic modernization .
The key question : Will politics or business be the deciding factor ?
The state still has a stake in BPA and government approval is necessary for the bid to proceed .
But a refusal of the bid could send negative signals about Portuguese economic policy and the need for reforms .
Both sides are busy lobbying government officials in Lisbon .
`` A rejection of the bid would show that state intervention in Portugal 's economy continues unabated , in spite of promises by Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva to end it , '' said Mari Vargas , an analyst at Dillon Read in London .
That , in turn , could stem the flow of foreign capital into Portugal , which has increased in recent years as multinationals and fund managers latched on to one of Europe 's most promising emerging markets .
The battle also stars two titans of Portugal 's business world , men whose ups and downs have been closely intertwined with the nation 's history .
BCP Chairman Jorge Jardim Goncalves , 58 , left Portugal soon after the 1974 communist-led revolution , returning a few years later when a conciliatory government invited him to become a BPA board member .
He went on to become chairman but was frustrated by the roadblocks the state put in his path , so he quit BPA and in 1985 set up BCP , with the backing of more than 200 shareholders , to capitalize on Portugal 's entry into the freer markets of the European Union .
Today , as one of Portugal 's most prestigious bankers , he aims to trim BPA 's sails by pulling it out of non-banking areas and turning it into a lean money-machine on the model of BCP .
Getting hold of the larger bank 's network of 550 branches could mean a big sales boost for BCP insurance and investment products .
Leading BPA 's defense is Sonae Investimentos SGPS SA Chairman Belmiro de Azevedo , a 56-year-old former chemical engineer whose personal net worth is reportedly around 104.7 billion escudos .
Mr. Azevedo was a plant general manager for Sonae when its then-owner fled to Brazil following the revolution .
Mr. Azevedo stayed behind and took charge .
A few years later , the owner returned and , in gratitude , enabled Mr. Azevedo to take a stake in the company .
From that nucleus , he built up a majority stake , taking the firm into new areas in Portugal and abroad .
Sonae dabbles in everything from wood products to real estate , supermarkets and newspaper publishing .
It officially owns 6.5 % of BPA stock and wants to continue a relationship in which it , along with other firms , has used BPA 's financial clout to back various business projects .
Mr. Azevedo said he has the support of shareholders owning more than 27 % of BPA 's stock .
Given that the Portuguese government owns 24.5 % of BPA but remains neutral , the shareholders group says it needs to build a voting bloc of about 38 % to thwart the bid by BCP , which seeks a controlling stake of as much as 40 % .
But under Portugal 's complex legal system , it is n't certain if BCP 's bid will go ahead .
A law protecting recently privatized companies from raiders requires government approval of any move to acquire a stake of more than 10 % .
The bid has created a novel and somewhat confusing situation for Portuguese regulators , who have never dealt with a hostile takeover attempt .
Portugal 's stock market commission suspended BPA shares Wednesday at 2,650 escudos amid speculation that Mr. Azevedo 's shareholder group had been buying extra shares to increase its stake .
That has n't been officially confirmed , and if it is true , the group might find itself obliged to launch an official counterbid to BCP 's offer , which values BPA at 3,000 escudos a share .
But given the cost , analysts said , some members of the shareholder group probably would be reluctant to go along .
Politics could still prove an obstacle , however .
Indeed , in terms issued recently for the planned privatization of a smaller bank , Banco Pinto & Sotto Mayor , the government specifically ruled out BPSM 's sale to a big banking group to avoid `` significant imbalances '' in Portugal 's financial market .
A combination of BCP and BPA could create such an imbalance .
The banks together would control nearly one-quarter of Portugal 's banking assets , behind state-owned Caixa Geral de Depositos 's 28 % market share , but well ahead of Banco Totta e Acores with 14 % , and Banco Espirito Santo 's 11 % .
Internationally , it would rank among the world 's 170 largest banks , with combined assets of more than $ 30 billion at the end of 1993 .
Pending a government decision , both sides are pulling strings .
In an effort to halt a bid that some analysts think could still prompt his BPA shareholders group to come unstuck , Mr. Azevedo is lobbying members of Mr. Cavaco Silva 's Social Democratic Party .
Meanwhile , Mr. Jardim Goncalves has appealed to the free-market sensibilities of Finance Minister Eduardo de Almeida Catroga , a 52-year-old former businessman and nonparty independent , to allow the bid to go ahead .
One of the keys to BCP 's strategy has been to stay out of nonfinancial business .
So it 's hardly surprising to hear BCP officials criticize some of the deals that have characterized relations between BPA and its shareholders-operations that shareholder Mr. Azevedo describes as `` strategically significant .
'' Such transactions are n't out of keeping with the way Mr. Azevedo built Sonae into one of Portugal 's most powerful industrial and commercial groups .
His fortune is based on Sonae 's commercial success , but much of the funding for the company 's growth has come from astute financial transactions .
In the days following the announcement of BCP 's bid , Mr. Azevedo took the lead in organizing BPA 's resistance .
He rounded up other shareholders that had formed part of a government-sponsored core group at the time of BPA 's privatization , winning pledges from them that they would n't sell their shares .
In a war of words between the two factions fighting for BPA , members of Mr. Azevedo 's camp criticize BCP 's high foreign share-ownership , which they said could imply a foreign takeover of BPA if BCP gets its way .
Banco Central Hispanoamericano of Spain has a 20 % holding in BCP , and other foreign institutions and private investors hold about 30 % of BCP 's shares .
BCP officials said the bank 's management is entirely Portuguese and voting rights are limited for all shareholders , including BCH , to 10 % of its capital .
People in the Azevedo camp point to the salaries of BCP executives , which if mirrored at BPA , they claim , would add an extra burden of expense .
BCP officials agree that they are highly paid , but said they work long hours .
BPA shareholders point to the high cost for BCP of the bid -- equivalent to nearly 80 % of its shareholders ' equity at the end of last year and nearly six times its 1993 net profit of 22.6 billion escudos .
BCP said it would finance part of the acquisition cost by selling some BPA holdings , possibly reducing its share of Portugal 's banking assets in the process to counter criticisms of excessive concentration .
What effect such arguments will have remains to be seen .
The government has until early September to determine whether to authorize BCP 's bid .
If it gives a green light , it will be up to BPA 's shareholders to decide what happens next .
If the bid gets rejected , Mr. Jardim Goncalves , a resilient veteran of business clashes , will look for some other way of gaining market share .
His most obvious option ?
A takeover bid for another Portuguese bank .
OTTAWA -- Canada 's trade surplus widened significantly in June from the previous month to 1.11 billion Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 806 million -RRB- , reflecting strong exports to the U.S. , according to Statistics Canada .
For May , Canada recorded a revised trade surplus of C$ 179 million .
Exports surged 8.2 % in June from May to a record level .
Agricultural products , industrial goods such as metals and plastics , and autos accounted for most of the increase .
Imports also reached a record level in June , rising 2.6 % from May .
The June increase was the fourth straight monthly rise in imports and reflected stronger consumer demand in Canada , said Sherry Cooper , chief economist at Burns Fry .
June 's record import and export levels point to continued `` vigorous economic activity '' in Canada , Ms. Cooper said .
Canada 's exports to the U.S. totaled C$ 14.93 billion , or about 82 % of the country 's total shipments .
Imports from the U.S. totaled C$ 12.59 billion , or 74 % of all Canadian imports .
Statistics Canada said exports to the U.S. were fueled by a robust U.S. economy and a decline in the Canadian dollar against its U.S. counterpart .
The Canadian dollar has lost more than 4 % against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year .
DETROIT -- Mercedes-Benz AG said it will increase prices as much as 4 % for some of its lower-priced 1995-model cars , but that its overall prices would decrease by 2.7 % because of its previously announced decision to lower prices on highend models .
Until a few years ago , Mercedes , a unit of Daimler-Benz AG , was able to pass along regular price increases to its customers because of its stellar reputation and lack of competition .
But that changed in 1989 when Japanese car makers began introducing highly touted luxury cars , such as Toyota Motor Corp. 's Lexus LS 400 , that were priced tens of thousands of dollars lower than comparable Mercedes models .
Now , Mercedes is holding the line on prices , or in some cases slashing them , in an effort to regain market share from the Japanese .
At the same time , the prices of Japanese luxury cars have soared .
The cheapest 1995-model Mercedes , the C220 sedan , will start at $ 29,900 , an increase of $ 1,050 , or 3.5 % , from the current model .
Another popular model , the E420 , will have a base price of $ 52,500 , up $ 1,500 , or 2.9 % .
At the high end of the Mercedes spectrum , prices of many models were substantially reduced .
The SL500 roadster , for example , will have a base price of $ 89,900 , down $ 9,600 , or 9.9 % , from the 1994 model .
TEL AVIV -- Economic officials , eager to gauge how Israeli investors will react to a new capital-gains tax when the Israeli stock market reopens on Sunday , have their eyes on a different city for now : New York .
Close to 70 Israeli and Israel-related companies trade on Wall Street , and analysts say the performance this week of those companies is the best indication of what to expect in Israel in the wake of financial reforms introduced by the government this week , including a 10 % capital-gains tax .
If approved by Parliament , the tax will go into effect Jan. 1 .
Officials closed the Tel Aviv exchange Wednesday in an effort to prevent investor panic over the new tax .
The exchange is to reopen Sunday , but officials announced a one-day lifting of rules that ordinarily limit to 10 % the drop or rise in Israeli share prices .
The limit will be reinstated on Monday .
The index of Israeli stocks traded in New York fell 9 % after the government 's announcement Tuesday , before climbing 1 % on Wednesday .
Israeli stocks were mixed yesterday .
`` Short-term , this does create some chaos in Israel , '' said Theodor J. Kundtz , senior vice president at Lehman Brothers in New York , `` but long-term , whether the government can get inflation back into single digits is more important for the stock market performance than a modest capital-gains tax .
'' While most of the Israeli business community has long accepted the notion that real profits on stocks should be taxed , the Treasury Ministry 's decision was a surprise , coming so soon after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin promised he would never support such a move .
Mr. Rabin said he changed his mind because the reforms are necessary to control inflation , now running at 15 % a year .
Some economic analysts questioned whether the tax might have the opposite effect : scaring investors out of the market and leading them to buy consumer goods and houses , thus fueling inflation .
Investor concern about possible future tax increases could cause additional volatility , they said .
In New York , Israeli institutions , particularly mutual funds , have been selling shares in response to greater-than-usual demand by Israeli investors eager to redeem their fund shares when the Tel Aviv market reopens Sunday , according to Jonathan Half , a research analyst at Oscar Gruss & Son Inc. in New York .
Avraham Poraz , a member of the Israeli Parliament 's Finance Committee , said he will introduce an amendment to the Treasury legislation to allow stock-trading losses to offset gains when calculating the tax , as is done in the U.S. WASHINGTON -- Congress has just about finished writing rules to turn the latest global trade treaty into U.S. law .
But it 's including some rules that will make it harder , not easier , to buy and sell overseas -- exactly the opposite of what the overall agreement is supposed to do .
Not by accident .
The drafting process includes an intense lobbying effort that pits those seeking extra protection for their clients , such as ball-bearing makers Timken Co. and Ingersoll-Rand Co. 's Torrington Co. unit , against those who want fewer trade restrictions , such as big-time exporters Cargill Inc. and Caterpillar Inc. .
As often happens , the protectionists win more than they lose .
Whether this is necessary or desirable causes endless debate .
The Clinton administration says it 's merely doing what must be done to get the total trade package through a skeptical Congress .
But many economists and export-minded business executives accuse it of retreating from its pro-trade principles .
`` The legislation reflects a balance '' between protectionist and free trade extremes , contends Susan Esserman , the assistant commerce secretary who tracks the political process most closely .
These clauses bear `` almost no relationship anymore to economic reality , '' counters Kimberly Ann Elliott , an economist who generally opposes restrictions .
The legislation concerns the pact completed last December under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
The disputes revolve around how much the U.S. is revising original terms as it writes them into U.S. law .
Most arguments involve antidumping law , complex clauses that let aggrieved companies seek penalties against foreign rivals who sell goods at `` unfair , '' even `` predatory , '' prices .
The drafting process may be completed today , allowing a final vote on the GATT agreement as soon as Congress can schedule it .
The whole topic is extremely complicated -- and for most people , extremely boring .
But huge sums are at stake , for a single legal phrase may determine how easily companies can act against overseas competitors that do n't seem to play fair .
Washington considers these rules essential tools for taking retaliatory action when it believes other countries are n't reducing trade barriers .
Antidumping laws help `` keep industries properly competitive , '' says Mickey Kantor , the chief U.S. trade negotiator who says he 's basically content with what Congress is doing .
Yet many are n't content .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says these rules -- once intended to keep unfairly low prices from driving competitors out of business -- are now more often used whenever companies feel `` any injury '' from foreign rivals .
Because there is no similar protection from domestic competition , these laws `` are biased against foreign exporters and against consumers of foreign goods , '' the CBO concluded .
Now Congress and the administration seem to be tilting the system even further , and writing into law restrictions that are n't in the GATT treaty .
For example , one of perhaps 25 changes will require the government to make certain profit assumptions when deciding whether foreign goods are sold here at unfair prices .
This procedure will make it harder for foreigners to defend themselves , especially companies such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Philips Electronics NV that sell products to their own factories or distribution systems in the U.S. The European Union has complained repeatedly about what a Brussels official calls `` this toughening up of U.S. antidumping law based on certain ideas put forward by interest groups .
'' One Washington lawyer with EU clients says the law `` will punish those who have actually invested in the U.S. , exactly the ones the administration has tried to encourage .
'' Washington contends that low export prices often reflect exorbitant profits at home -LRB- in Japan , for example -RRB- , where outside competition is restricted .
Mr. Kantor uses these antidumping laws as weapons when trying to pry open such closed markets .
But critics say another result is that 40 nations have adopted similar rules , making U.S. companies , on a global basis , the leading targets in dumping cases .
Cargill has five pending against it in Mexico alone .
For the most part , these tougher clauses persist because Congress responds when constituents complain , and the Clinton administration compromises to speed along the trade package .
And there 's no doubt these terms will help troubled U.S. companies , while keeping lawyers and lobbyists busy for years .
But whether these special interests deserve such help , and how much the economy will benefit , is less clear .
BRUSSELS -- Euro Disney SCA 's top financial officer has left the company , apparently feeling he 's done his job .
Michael Montgomery , the 39-year-old executive vice president for finance , felt he had completed his task of restructuring the theme park 's battered finances and wants to run his own business , according to people close to the company .
Mr. Montgomery , who previously served as treasurer at Walt Disney Co. , was n't available for comment .
Walt Disney Co. , Burbank , Calif. , owns 49 % of Euro Disney .
Euro Disney said that Vice President Controller Xavier de Mezerac will assume the position of chief financial officer , now the company 's top financial post .
Messrs. Montgomery and de Mezerac joined the Euro Disney finance team in April 1993 as the troubled company set out to overhaul a balance sheet crippled by high debt and lower-than-expected revenue from its theme park near Paris .
The effort culminated in a debt restructuring and an agreement with Saudi investor Prince al-Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud to back a rights issue and acquire as much as 24 % of Euro Disney .
As the company announced Mr. Montgomery 's departure , it noted that the entire 5.8 billion francs -LRB- $ 1.09 billion -RRB- raised from the recent share issue was used to pay off bank debt .
A spokesman said Euro Disney 's debt now stands at about 16 billion francs compared with nearly 22 billion francs before the rights issue .
`` Michael has overseen the financial restructuring of Euro Disney to a successful conclusion , '' Chairman Philippe Bourguignon said .
`` The whole team joins me in thanking him for his outstanding commitment and contribution in putting Euro Disney on a sound financial footing .
'' Financial analysts reacted calmly to the changeover .
`` I do n't think it is a cause for concern for the company , '' said Nigel Reed of Paribas Ltd. `` The company has a window of opportunity to get things sorted out .
'' In trading on the Paris stock exchange yesterday , Euro Disney closed at 10.35 francs , off slightly from 10.6 francs , in a market that was down in general .
Euro Disney is n't expected to return to profit until at least the year ending in September 1995 .
PAC RIM HOLDING Corp. -LRB- Woodland Hills , Calif. -RRB- -- Five directors were elected , following the formal closing of a previously announced plan to issue a $ 20 million investment proposal .
Robert M. Anderson , 51 years old , one of the new directors , was elected chairman of this workers ' compensation insurance underwriter , succeeding Chester I. Lappen , 75 , who resigned .
Mr. Anderson is the owner , president and chief executive of Anderson & Anderson Insurance Brokers Inc. .
The additional directors are Richard H. Pickup , 60 , senior vice president of Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc. ; Timothy R. Busch , 39 , president and chief executive of the Busch Firm ; Dennis J. Aigner , 52 , professor of management and economics and dean of the Graduate School of Management at the University of California , Irvine ; and Dennis Harwood , 55 , a partner in the law firm of Barger & Wolen .
They fill vacancies created by the resignations of Armin H. Dolin , 66 , William K. Glikbarg , 69 , Frank V. Marshall Jr. , 67 , and David P. Rousso , 53 .
Whirlpool Corp. said it will start building a new European-style washing machine in the U.S. in 1996 , three years before federal energy-efficiency standards go into effect , which could force appliance makers to produce such machines .
The washers , which tumble clothes like dryers , use about one-third of the water and energy used by conventional vertical-axis machines that churn clothes with agitators .
But the so-called horizontal-axis washers have n't been popular in the U.S. , partly because they are more expensive and load from the front instead of the top .
Whirlpool , based in Benton Harbor , Mich. , would n't disclose how its machines will load or where they will be built .
But Vince Anderson , the company 's North American director of environmental programs , said in an interview that the challenge is to take European horizontal-axis technology and `` meet , if not exceed , U.S. consumers ' expectations .
'' Engineers from Whirlpool 's European unit are helping the U.S. team develop the new washer .
Other companies , such as Maytag Corp. of Newton , Iowa , and the Frigidaire unit of Sweden 's AB Electrolux , also are developing new horizontal-axis washers for the U.S. market .
Frigidaire , which has said its new model will be available next year , already makes a horizontal washer .
But it has n't really taken off with U.S. consumers .
Maytag has n't disclosed an introduction date .
But Whirlpool 's is the most significant entry yet because the company controls about half of the $ 2.5 billion U.S. market for washing machines .
The company sells in the U.S. under its own brand name , and under the Kenmore label sold by Sears , Roebuck & Co. .
`` It 's excellent for the market , '' said Jim Staber , whose closely held Staber Industries Inc. of Groveport , Ohio , recently began selling its own horizontal-axis washer .
`` I would think Whirlpool would be able to promote horizontal-axis laundry equipment pretty well .
'' Whirlpool 's move was also praised by environmental groups .
But early success is far from ensured .
Indeed , Whirlpool 's own vice president of laundry manufacturing and technology said in an interview earlier this year that , `` We 're not sure that market is out there .
'' Mr. Staber said it 's too early to tell whether his tiny company 's entry is a success .
Selling directly to consumers since last spring , Staber Industries has sold fewer than 100 machines at $ 899 each .
Whirlpool said it hopes its machines will cost less than that .
The company plans to spend at least $ 40 million to convert production for the new models .
But it said the total investment could grow to hundreds of millions of dollars to meet the expected 1999 standards from the Department of Energy .
That 's because if appliance makers ca n't greatly increase the efficiency of today 's washers , the stricter standards could force them to switch all their production to horizontal-axis machines .
AMSOUTH BANCORP. -LRB- Birmingham , Ala. -RRB- -- C. Dowd Ritter , 47 years old , was elected president and chief operating officer of this banking concern .
The election puts Mr. Ritter , formerly vice chairman , in line to succeed John W. Woods , 63 , chairman and chief executive , who is scheduled to retire in August 1996 .
Mr. Woods formerly held the additional title of president .
The position of chief operating officer has been vacant for several years .
LONDON -- Nearly a year after Credit Commercial de France and Berliner Handels - und Frankfurter Bank heralded their # 149 million -LRB- $ 229.7 million -RRB- purchase of Charterhouse PLC from Royal Bank of Scotland PLC , an ambitious three-country investment-banking partnership is beginning to flex its muscles .
In terms of extra earnings , officials of the three partner banks say , the linkup has yet to produce significant cash returns .
Behind the scenes , however , things are beginning to happen .
In London , BHF Bank and Charterhouse have pooled resources to create a new London-based structured finance team , with CCF expected to send two executives to join it in the fall .
A privatization specialist , Howard Hyman , has been hired from Price Waterhouse , the accounting firm , to take up a top investment-banking role .
In continental Europe , a new Luxembourg holding company jointly owned by BHF and CCF has taken over CCF 's offices in Milan and Madrid and transferred their management to Charterhouse as part of an arrangement to give it responsibility for international mergers and acquisitions activity outside the three banks ' home markets .
With what effect ?
Not much in terms of deals that actually have materialized .
Indeed , for the moment , cooperation still seems to be at an embryonic stage .
But officials from all three banks insist that the outlook is positive .
`` This is a long-term operation , '' says Rene de la Serre , CCF 's deputy chairman .
`` We 're looking at the slow but gradual construction of a team of three banks , whose fruits should become evident in three to four years time .
'' In business terms , acknowledges Wulf von Schimmelmann , one of six BHF Bank managing partners and a member of Charterhouse 's board , `` the number of cross-border transactions has so far been limited .
'' Initially , however , he insists , `` it 's more important for people to get to know each other .
My feeling is that the philosophy behind the three banks is already migrating to a common philosophy .
'' From the outside , analysts still express skepticism as to the linkup 's practical advantages .
Charterhouse , a small institution with specialties in development capital and management buyouts , traditionally has served a market of medium-size U.K. companies .
Many of its clients are only now beginning to wake up to opportunities in continental Europe .
CCF and BHF Bank , by contrast , are larger banks with a longer international tradition .
They got to know each other as members of Interalpha , one of several international banking associations that sprang up in the 1970s .
Each holds 2 % of the other 's capital , and they are planning other moves together .
As things stand , says Sarah Manton , an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co. in London , `` the impression is that they are getting more from each other in new business than they are getting from Charterhouse .
'' As part of the cooperation , CCF recently transferred its five-person corporate finance team in Germany , CCF Interfinanz , to BHF Bank , signaling an end to independent CCF efforts to crack Germany 's corporate finance market .
CCF also is studying the possibility of taking a stake in a Czech bank , Zivnostenska Banka , of which BHF Bank owns 40 % .
But while no sudden upsurge in activity has resulted from the Charterhouse acquisition , people involved in the process say that 's hardly surprising .
Indeed , after a flush of enthusiasm for such ventures in the late 1980s , they point out , bankers throughout Europe have had to acknowledge that cross-border partnerships of this kind often take longer to get off the ground than expected .
Recession is partly to blame .
Hit by a slowdown in their economies , firms in France and Germany have n't been hurrying to hit the acquisition trail .
But getting teams from different countries to work together also takes time .
As part of that process , a trickle of executives has begun to move between posts at the three partner banks , and more exchanges are planned .
Executives in all three centers take part in weekly video conferences to discuss specific projects , and the bank 's top managers meet regularly at board level to discuss the partnership 's development .
In some areas , to be sure , the potential for cooperation is questionable .
Each bank runs its own money-market trading operations , for example , with little apparent prospect for cooperation .
In the equities sector , there are plans to pool research efforts , but little more .
`` You have got to recognize that in equities they are in competition between themselves and with us , '' says Victor Blank , the chairman of Charterhouse .
Possible future cooperation in that sector is `` still very much up in the air , '' he says .
In other areas , however , cooperation is steaming ahead .
Recognizing Charterhouse 's skills in development capital , for example , CCF and BHF Bank have put the U.K. bank in charge of their activities in this sector throughout Europe .
A new fund , Charterhouse Capital Partners V , recently raised # 234 million , with a view to increasing that level subsequently to a total of around # 300 million .
Other smaller funds are being raised in France and Germany .
In the mergers and acquisitions sector , only one deal directly attributable to the partnership has gone through so far : the recent # 7.8 million acquisition by a French manufacturer of hand-tools , Facom SA , of a U.K. engineering company , Sykes Pickavant PLC. .
But more than 30 other proposals resulting from the partnership are under study by the corporate finance departments of the three banks .
They include a German beer company that wants to make an acquisition elsewhere in Europe , other French and German companies looking for U.K. acquisitions and British companies interested in acquisitions in continental Europe .
A team of six top executives , two from each of the three banks , meets regularly to discuss ways they can help their clients develop cross-border operations .
In cash terms , CCF and BHF Bank expect a 10 % return on their investment in Charterhouse this year and hope for higher returns later .
Though he declines to make any precise profits forecast , Mr. Blank predicts that Charterhouse 's earnings are improving .
Charterhouse reported a net profit of # 22 million for the 15 months ended Dec. 31 1993 , compared with # 18.9 million for the preceding 12 months period to Sept. 30 , 1992 .
Its total assets as of Dec. 31 , 1993 were # 1.2 billion , down from # 2.4 billion as of Sept. 30 , 1992 , reflecting a restructuring of its balance sheet in connection with the transfer of its ownership .
Looking ahead , BHF and CCF officials say they expect to obtain reasonable returns from Charterhouse in the short term , with the prospect of higher earnings as the cooperation between them intensifies .
`` Here you have three institutions with a reasonable market position of their own coming together , '' says Mr. Blank .
`` The challenge is to get people who have their own agendas and their own business to see the advantages of the wider strategy .
'' It 's going to be difficult to dodge dwarfs , dinosaurs and a pet named Dino this fall .
A beloved family classic and two recent box-office hits will be released on videocassettes within weeks of one another beginning in October , setting up the biggest-budget marketing battle ever in the home-video market .
Major advertising campaigns , at least one exceeding $ 50 million , already are beginning to try to create a buzz behind the release of Walt Disney 's `` Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs '' and MCA\/Universal 's `` Jurassic Park '' and `` The Flintstones .
'' The studios want to stir up demand in advance of the Christmas gift-giving season , which has become ever more critical to the home-video industry .
Last weekend , MCA\/Universal , a unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial , fired the first shot with full-page ads in magazines such as People and USA Weekend , heralding the release of `` Jurassic Park .
'' `` After 65 million years , '' the ad declares , `` they 're coming home October 4 .
On videocassette .
'' This is only the beginning for the Steven Spielberg blockbuster .
MCA\/Universal is planning an advertising and promotional campaign estimated at $ 65 million for the video , which has a suggested retail price of $ 24.98 .
-LRB- Home-video prices typically are reduced to the $ 15 to $ 20 range by retailers , and consumer-product company rebates can trim the cost even further .
-RRB- It would seem the 1937 film `` Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs '' would need little advertising .
When Disney announced in February it would be selling `` Snow White '' on video for $ 26.99 , beginning Oct. 28 , consumers flocked to stores to reserve copies of the latest Disney classic animated film to be released on video .
But for the first time for one of its videos , Disney has hired an outside advertising agency , Hal Riney & Partners , San Francisco , to work with the studio on the `` Snow White '' campaign .
The company declined to disclose its marketing budget .
But they say the campaign for `` Snow White '' is the most aggressive the studio ever initiated .
MCA\/Universal is expected to announce on Monday details of its multimillion-dollar marketing push for `` The Flintstones '' video , which will be released Nov. 8 and be priced lower than its two main competitors , at $ 19.98 .
All three videos are expected to have promotional partners .
`` Snow White '' is tying in with Pillsbury for a $ 5 mail-in refund offer , while `` Jurassic Park '' has multiple partners , including McDonald 's , Kraft General Foods ' Jell-O brand , Kenner toys , Tiger Electronics and CompuServe .
Through advertising and promotions , MCA executives say the `` Jurassic Park '' pitch will be heard 25.5 times by 98 % of all adults in the U.S. .
More than 15 million packages of Jell-O gelatin and pudding snacks will carry $ 5 rebates .
Kenner , which makes toys based on the movie , will advertise the home-video release .
And CompuServe will feature `` Jurassic Park '' contests and prizes on its on-line computer service .
What 's more , 15-second commercials for `` Jurassic Park '' will appear during such prime-time shows as `` Seinfeld , '' `` Monday Night Football , '' `` Northern Exposure '' and `` The Simpsons .
'' `` Our goal is to make ` Jurassic Park ' the biggest selling videocassette of all time , '' says Louis Feola , president of MCA Home Video .
Not surprisingly , that is precisely the objective of Buena Vista Home Video , the video distribution arm of Disney .
`` We think ` Snow White ' will be the number one selling video of the year and a contender to the all-time best seller , '' says Ann Daly , president of Buena Vista Home Video .
To achieve that status , each must sweep past Disney 's `` Aladdin , '' the No. 1 selling videocassette with sales of 24 million units , according to Video Business magazine , a Capital Cities\/ABC publication .
Disney animated classics , in fact , occupy all of the top five positions .
`` ET : The Extra Terrestrial , '' which is nonanimated , is sixth .
Consumers now buy an estimated $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion of videos each year , and that 's `` clearly where the growth is in the industry , '' says Bruce Apar , editor of Video Business .
`` Consumers want to build libraries , '' not just rent movies .
Mr. Apar adds that the Christmas season is `` extremely important '' to the video industry , which like the toy business , records `` most of its sales in the fourth quarter .
'' Buena Vista and MCA\/Universal play down the rivalry this year and say the home-video market has grown large enough that competing titles wo n't cannibalize each other .
'' ` Snow White ' is going to be successful regardless of what else is out there , '' says Ms. Daly of Buena Vista .
Putting it on sale for a limited time only `` preserves its specialness , '' she adds , but also creates a heavy initial demand .
-LRB- `` Snow White '' is scheduled to be taken off the market in the spring .
-RRB- Perhaps to signify the importance of the release of `` Jurassic Park , '' MCA\/Universal is producing a `` clean '' copy , Hollywood jargon for not placing any coming attractions at the beginning of the home video version .

NEW YORK -- In a move to keep AlliedSignal Inc. chairman Lawrence A. Bossidy in the company , directors doubled his salary as part of a compensation package valued at as much as $ 47 million over six years .
Mr. Bossidy is credited with boosting the company 's fortunes since taking over as chief executive in July 1991 .
He was frequently mentioned as a serious contender in searches for the top job at International Business Machines Corp. and Merck & Co. .
Mr. Bossidy , who will retire on April 1 , 2000 , came to AlliedSignal from General Electric Co. , where he was a vice chairman .
`` The board offered a long-term contract because it did n't want to risk losing him , '' said a spokesman .
The new compensation agreement was reached in May , amid rumors that Mr. Bossidy might be tapped for the top job at Merck .
But the changes were only recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The board raised his annual salary to $ 2 million , effective June 1 , 1994 , from $ 1.1 million .
He will be paid $ 1.85 million in bonus for this year and $ 1.6 million in future years if the company meets certain targets .
In 1993 , Mr. Bossidy earned $ 1.5 million in bonus .
The package also grants options and restricted units on almost 1.8 million AlliedSignal shares .
Those grants could boost the total value to $ 47 million based on certain assumptions about increases in the company 's stock price .
The value would drop sharply if the financial performance and stock price do n't meet the targets , however .
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit narrowed slightly in June as the strength of the economy showed up in high levels of imports and exports .
The Commerce Department said the deficit shrank to $ 9.37 billion from a revised $ 9.52 billion in May .
As usual , merchandise was the key contributing factor to the gap .
In June , the U.S. imported a record $ 56.18 billion in goods while exporting a near-record $ 42.02 billion , creating a $ 14.16 billion deficit .
The $ 4.80 billion surplus in trade of services was n't enough to compensate .
The figures reflect the continued growth in the U.S. economy while many global economies remain sluggish .
Many analysts expect that situation to change later in the year , however , as other nations ' economies expand .
Analysts predict the trade deficit will remain large , and narrow slightly at the end of 1994 or early 1995 .
Senior Economist Carl Palash of McCarthy , Crisanti & Maffei Inc. does n't expect much improvement during the year because of the long lags between the decreased value of the dollar and changes in the deficit .
Bruce Steinberg , senior economist for Merrill Lynch Inc. , noted that exports of capital goods are strong , almost triple the rate of other products .
`` The whole world is in a capital-spending boom , '' he said .
Leading exports in the capital-goods area included semiconductors , telecommunications equipment , civilian aircraft and computer products .
Crude-oil imports -- the largest single item in June -- rose a record 9 % , contributing $ 3.8 billion to the deficit .
Economist Brian Horrigan of Loomis , Sayles & Co. said the increase in oil imports raises a warning sign about oil dependence .
Not only did the volume of oil imports increase , but the price of imported oil climbed to $ 15.14 a barrel from $ 14.04 in May .
Mr. Horrigan feels that `` the oil situation could become the albatross around our neck , '' especially with the high consumption due to summer vacations .
Meanwhile , the trade deficit between the U.S. and Japan continued to widen , to $ 5.52 billion in June from $ 4.39 billion in May , causing some concern among financial-market participants .
Nevertheless , one analyst cites the increase in Japanese imports of American automobiles as a good sign .
Exports to Canada and Mexico in the first half were 11.6 % above a year earlier .
`` All three countries are continuing to benefit '' from the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement , said Commerce Secretary Ron Brown .
Still , the U.S. had a $ 1.3 billion trade deficit with Canada due to a large volume of imports -- $ 11.51 billion , up from $ 10.78 billion in May .
The trade balance with Mexico remained favorable , but the surplus narrowed to $ 198 million from $ 353 million in June .
The job market has been responding to the growing economy .
Despite a rise of 3,000 , to 327,000 , in new claims for state unemployment benefits last week , the Labor Department said , the four-week average fell to 323,750 from 339,500 and was at its lowest level since the end of last year .
Here are the Commerce Department 's monthly trade figures , in billions of dollars .
SEATTLE -- Washington Energy Co. 's natural-gas unit said it laid off 66 employees as part of a restructuring designed to cut costs and improve efficiency .
Washington Natural Gas expects to cut 150 jobs by Oct. 1 , a reduction of about 10 % in its total work force .
In the company 's third fiscal quarter ended June 30 , the company established a $ 4.6 million restructuring reserve , of which $ 2.3 million relates to employee severance .
There is a thread of truth in your July 27 Corporate Focus report on Trans World Airlines , but analysts predicting the imminent demise of the airline underestimate the commitment of TWA 's employee-owners to remaking the company into a carrier that can compete and win in the '90s and beyond .
Of course these are the same guys who predicted we would n't get out of bankruptcy , then we would n't make it through last winter , or through this September .
At least they are consistent .
We also know what works at TWA .
Our St. Louis hub is strong and profitable , and we have won widespread recognition for our industry-leading customer service .
We show strong growth in St. Louis markets and now have more than 69 % .
We also know what does n't work .
Our cash position is tight and the winter months have always been challenging for TWA .
Immediate financial restructuring must be undertaken , and we must improve productivity at all levels of the company for long-term success .
Yes , there have been management changes and cutbacks .
We 've closed unprofitable operations .
Rather than signs of a meltdown , these actions are necessary first steps to long-term success .
Working with management , union representatives on our board of directors have committed to achieving additional expense reductions within the next 60 days .
We are starting with a blank sheet of paper to formulate work rules that reflect current market realities , industry competitive conditions and the fact that our company is largely employee-owned .
There are those who say employee ownership wo n't work because employees and unions do n't have the intellectual toughness to make the decisions that impact their jobs and benefits .
I say those people do n't know the employee-owners of TWA .
The business world is watching and asking some very good questions .
I 'm confident the men and women of TWA have the right answers .
ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said its directors authorized the repurchase of as many as 10 million of the company 's 130 million common shares .
The company bottles Coca-Cola Co. products .
FRANKFURT -- Henkel KGaA , a German specialty chemicals group , reported an 11 % jump in group pretax profit in the first half of 1994 .
Pretax profit climbed to 364 million marks -LRB- $ 234.6 million -RRB- from 328 million marks in the same period a year earlier .
Sales stagnated just below previous-year levels .
In the first six months , group sales totaled 7.063 billion marks , just below 7.067 billion marks a year earlier .
A 3 % drop in sales in Germany and western Europe was nearly offset by an 11 % gain in exports , Henkel said .
While most divisions showed increases in sales , the largest operating division , soaps and detergents , showed a drop of 8.1 % in first-half sales to 2.08 billion marks .
Stripping out the effects of exchange-rate fluctations , sales fell only 6 % and the company said it held its market position despite the sales decline .
Henkel 's expansion for soaps and detergents outside Europe `` has borne its first fruits , '' the company said .
The personal products unit also had a 1.4 % drop in group sales to 710 million marks in the period .
The large chemicals operations registered an 8.2 % increase in first-half group sales to 2.05 billion marks .
SAN SALVADOR -- What a difference a decade makes .
For a returning visitor , the evident pace of social , economic and political change in El Salvador is remarkable .
On my last visit in 1983 , as director of the Commerce Department 's Caribbean Basin Initiative -LRB- CBI -RRB- , the atmosphere of fear and stress was palpable .
My usual American Embassy contingent of two bodyguards with riot shotguns was a constant reminder of the political violence that had become pervasive in Salvadoran society .
It was difficult , back then , to get a sense of the lives of the common people as I sped around the capital in a bullet-proof embassy truck -LRB- safe only against small arms , not rocket-propelled grenades , I was told -RRB- , or attended meetings behind reinforced high walls and gates topped by razor wire .
Discussions with both older - and younger-generation business leaders about trade opportunities offered under the CBI never fully concealed the high levels of stress that made anything like a normal lifestyle impossible in a country racked by civil war .
You could feel the heavy hand of the U.S. government as El Salvador absorbed several billion dollars in economic and military assistance .
Chasing the yankee dollar diverted the attention of much of the private sector as normal business activity declined .
El Salvador today is a place and a people transformed .
City streets in San Salvador are clean and packed with neatly dressed pedestrians , whose confidence is reflected in the smiles on their faces .
New shops , restaurants and businesses are everywhere , reflecting the economic boom generated by peace and founded on the free-market-oriented economic policies of President Alfredo Cristiani and his successor from the same conservative party , President Armando Calderon Sol .
In San Salvador , a more sedate kind of excitement has returned to night life .
Young and old again crowd the sidewalk cafes and bistros of the Zona Rosa , scene of the murder of U.S. marines in 1984 .
The most serious negative today is an increase in common crimes .
Ironically , this probably reflects the new atmosphere of freedom generated by the breakup of the repressive local police authority allied to the army during the war .
The currency , the colon , has been stable at 8.7 to the dollar for months , and privatized banks are aggressively seeking new business financing opportunities .
Government investment in infrastructure is pervasive .
New four-lane carreteras -LRB- highways -RRB- are under construction around San Salvador and link the capital with the port of Acajuita .
One hears no whining about the loss of U.S. aid .
The traditional `` can-do '' spirit of Salvadoran business once again predominates as management and an exceptionally hard-working labor force willingly take on the international competition .
The family oligarchs who controlled much of the private sector have largely given way to a new generation of young business managers .
Applying their U.S. university training , they have restructured many of the family fiefdoms into U.S.-style professional business corporations .
Now managers are hired from outside or promoted from within based on merit rather than family membership .
Personal investment capital , long hidden in Miami banks , is again flowing into El Salvador , financing acquisitions , expansions and new businesses oriented to the newly competitive environment sparked by trade liberalization throughout Central America .
Managers know they must compete openly in the broader Western Hemisphere and are staffing up to do so .
One hears little paranoia over the North American Free Trade Agreement , but rather an eagerness to learn how El Salvador can accelerate its integration into this competitive arena .
Modern supermarkets compete with traditional popular markets , offering consumers a growing diversity of quality local and imported foods .
I even saw a brand-new Chevrolet dealership -- a rare bird indeed in Latin America , where the market had long been conceded to Japanese auto makers .
Perhaps the most exciting and promising business ventures are the new factories that ring the capital turning out apparel and electronic components for the U.S. and world markets , using the best just-in-time inventory management techniques .
However , it 's precisely these engines of growth that the Clinton administration is threatening with new calls for tight quotas on apparel imports .
Protectionist pressures to tighten quotas on apparel assembled in El Salvador and other CBI countries come from the shrinking ranks of U.S. apparel unions , which have lost their competitive edge in the industry but retain their political pull in Washington .
This is a departure from CBI policy , which for more than a decade has strongly encouraged the expansion of U.S. apparel trade with the Caribbean and Central America .
In principle and in practice , the growing trade benefits of CBI have been benefiting both sides .
U.S. textile-yarn and fabric makers have quietly welcomed the increased demand from nearby Caribbean Basin apparel makers , including those in El Salvador .
That 's because these manufacturers almost exclusively use U.S. fabric , cut to pattern in the U.S. , to assemble high-quality finished garments .
Similarly , U.S. apparel designers and large retailers increasingly have turned to factories in the Caribbean Basin , where quality workmanship , low cost , and flexible manufacturing schedules improve their ability to compete with apparel makers in Asia .
Also , Asian apparel makers are far less likely to use U.S.-made fabric .
One can only wonder at the logic of restricting El Salvador 's exports when the future of its democracy depends on economic development led by labor-intensive industries like apparel .
Perhaps it is true that only the squeaky-wheel of countries in crisis can get Washington 's attention today .
The Salvadoran people and their political leaders deserve praise for their dramatic accomplishments .
Rather than restricting trade , the Clinton administration should be opening the U.S. market and assisting El Salvador 's entry into the broader free trade areas of the Western Hemisphere .
Achieving democracy is wonderful .
But achieving the economic development crucial to sustaining democracy is an even greater goal .
Mr. Theriot , director of the Caribbean Basin Initiative at the Commerce Department , 1982-88 , is now a free-lance writer .
As Major League Baseball players continue their strike , a group of Cincinnati businessmen are pitching their own vision of the game .
The businessmen are transforming a downtown parking lot into a life-size baseball field , complete with infield , outfield , bases and a pitcher 's mound .
Thanks to heavy-duty sprayers and a lot of paint , come Monday morning patrons will be parking in left field , or on home plate .
The idea behind this concrete field of dreams is to persuade local residents and politicians to support a new 42,000-seat ballpark on the site .
`` We decided it was time to make it a little easier for people to see what we 're talking about , '' says Jim Tarbell , chairman of the Committee to Restore Intimacy in Baseball .
Riverfront Stadium -- current home of the Cincinnati Reds -- would then be used just for major-league football .
`` The city needs some excitement , '' says Rick Lehn , co-owner of Lehn Brothers , a local painting company that is donating manpower and equipment for the parking-lot project .
`` Just seeing home plate there , I was motivated .
'' It 's a weak substitute for the real thing , but the project 's promoters have gone to extra lengths to make the field look as realistic as possible .
Sherwin-Williams Co. , which is donating 600 gallons of paint , lugged in dirt and grass to make sure its paints match the real thing , says Craig Hudson , a Sherwin-Williams branch manager .
White traffic paint , dubbed `` Marge Schott white '' after the Reds ' owner , will be used to create the base lines and the bases .
So far , ballpark promoters have had to deal with only one curve ball -- a retaining wall that stands in the middle of what is supposed to be left field .
Their solution : painting it green to blend in with the `` grass .
'' `` If it does n't have wheels , we 'll paint it , '' says Tom Fernandez , an architect and leading ballpark proponent .
The lot owner , Parking Co. of America , will send extra employees to direct motorists , says Andrea Chavez , general manager .
Although parking lines will be slightly visible through the ballpark paint , Ms. Chavez says , `` It 's going to be surprising for parkers ... they 'll be driving onto a great big green field .
'' And if frustrated fans really miss their hometown favorites , Mr. Lehn says , `` Maybe we can paint some players out there .
'' A black former associate at White & Case who claimed he was the target of racist comments and discrimination has won a negotiated judgment of $ 505,000 against the New York-based law firm .
The lawyer , Andargachew Zelleke , alleged that lawyers in White & Case 's Los Angeles office squeezed him out of the firm after he complained that a senior associate had told colleagues , `` Zelleke is so stupid because he 's half-black , '' and had made other disparaging remarks about African Americans .
Legal experts say the case is apparently the first race-discrimination lawsuit by an attorney to result in a formal judgment against a major law firm .
White & Case , which did n't admit any wrongdoing , also paid an undisclosed amount to reimburse Mr. Zelleke 's legal fees and costs .
The agreement did n't prevent the parties from speaking about the case .
-LRB- Mr. Zelleke says the firm initially demanded confidentiality but that `` a gag order was out of the question '' ; White & Case says it never demanded that Mr. Zelleke remain silent .
-RRB- The case thus provides a rare glimpse at how a big law firm handled reports of alleged bigotry on the part of some of its lawyers .
Mr. Zelleke , a cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School , joined the Los Angeles office of 540-lawyer White & Case in 1988 .
Soon after , according to his suit , colleagues began to tell him that a senior associate in the office , Donald Ries , was making derogatory comments about him .
According to the lawsuit , Mr. Ries suggested to other lawyers that Mr. Zelleke was admitted to Harvard only as a result of affirmative action .
Mr. Ries also allegedly called Mr. Zelleke a `` black prince , '' in apparent reference to his Ethiopian heritage .
Mr. Ries , now an associate in the Los Angeles office of another New York law firm , Cadwalader , Wickersham & Taft , says : `` I did n't make any of the comments I 'm alleged to have made against Andy Zelleke .
'' He declines to comment further .
Mr. Zelleke said in court papers that after he complained about Mr. Ries to superiors he became the target of retaliation at the firm .
White & Case denies this .
Chairman James Hurlock says the firm offered to agree to the judgment as a litigation tactic .
`` The most uncertain of endeavors in life is litigation , '' Mr. Hurlock says .
`` And in a jury case , that 's even more uncertain .
We 're a big , allegedly wealthy firm against one individual , and we 've got a Los Angeles jury .
'' It was in July 1991 , Mr. Zelleke says , that he first reported Mr. Ries 's alleged statements to the then head of the corporate department of White & Case 's Los Angeles office , Jay Grodin .
According to court documents , other associates corroborated some of the allegedly racist statements made by Mr. Ries .
Within about 10 days , according to Mr. Zelleke 's lawsuit , Mr. Grodin and three other partners in the office told Mr. Zelleke they had investigated the matter and found it `` inconclusive '' but would warn Mr. Ries about racist comments .
The lawyers added they `` would also be warning all attorneys that the consequences of making false allegations would be immediate termination , '' the lawsuit said .
`` I was very upset by the termination threat and the insinuation that I had made false allegations , '' says Mr. Zelleke , 33 years old , who now teaches at the University of California , Los Angeles , law school .
The firm denies making any such threat .
Mr. Zelleke says his dissatisfaction with the Los Angeles partners ' response led him to contact Mr. Hurlock .
A few days later , at a meeting in Los Angeles , he told the firm 's chairman about his complaints and `` my perception that a whitewash was going on , '' Mr. Zelleke says .
In the suit , Mr. Zelleke said the chairman responded that `` he was very dissatisfied with the way the L.A. partners had investigated my allegations .
'' Mr. Zelleke said Mr. Hurlock also assured him there would be no reprisals against him .
Mr. Hurlock says he spoke to Mr. Ries shortly after his conversation with Mr. Zelleke and fired him because `` I was persuaded he had said enough of the things '' that Mr. Zelleke had alleged .
Meanwhile , Mr. Zelleke said in court documents that he was told that Mr. Ries was n't the only lawyer in the Los Angeles office allegedly making racist remarks .
Over lunch one day , a former White & Case associate , James Hicks , told Mr. Zelleke that he had heard Mr. Grodin , then the office 's corporate-department head , repeatedly refer to black lawyers who were opposite White & Case in a litigation matter in 1991 as `` niggers , '' `` jigaboos '' and `` spear chuckers .
'' Mr. Hicks , who reiterated his accusations in a sworn deposition and who is now a partner in the Los Angeles office of Houston-based law firm Andrews & Kurth , also claimed that Mr. Grodin occasionally read the black lawyers ' legal filings out loud in a minstrel-show accent .
Mr. Grodin , currently the managing partner at WKM Group , a Los Angeles real-estate investment firm , denies making the comments .
`` I do n't use language that way ... I never said it , '' says Mr. Grodin , who resigned his White & Case partnership to join the real-estate firm in 1992 but retains an of-counsel position at the law firm .
Mr. Grodin says Mr. Hicks concocted the story because he blamed Mr. Grodin when he was passed over for partner .
Three other White & Case lawyers who Mr. Hicks said were present when Mr. Grodin allegedly used the epithets all deny the account .
Mr. Zelleke says that after he heard the accusations about Mr. Grodin , he telephoned Mr. Hurlock but his call was never returned .
Mr. Hurlock says that neither he nor his secretary has `` any recollection or record '' of the call or any complaint from Mr. Zelleke about Mr. Grodin .
Thereafter , Mr. Zelleke says , the assignments he received declined in frequency and were `` substantially below '' the caliber of work he had been given previously .
Mr. Zelleke says that in a performance review he was told that his work was excellent but that he had a `` lack of commitment to the firm .
'' During a meeting in January 1993 to assess his partnership prospects , Mr. Zelleke said in court papers , a partner told him he had `` major negatives '' against him that had nothing to do with the quality of his work and suggested , among other options , that he leave the firm .
In May 1993 , he did leave and filed suit a month later .
Mr. Grodin says Mr. Zelleke 's assignments were n't affected by his complaints , but that `` corporate practice all over was slowing up .
'' Mr. Hurlock says that Mr. Zelleke was `` picky and choosy about the kind of work that he would do '' and that he had a bad attitude .
`` As far as I 'm concerned he left entirely voluntarily , '' Mr. Hurlock says .
White & Case says all of Mr. Zelleke 's allegations of discrimination were false .
In a letter answering an initial inquiry from Mr. Zelleke 's lawyers , the executive partner of the Los Angeles office , John Sturgeon , wrote : `` In the first place , Andy Zelleke 's skin is not black .
'' But Mr. Zelleke , whose father is from Ethiopia and whose mother is white , says the law firm counted him as African American for purposes of describing itself to potential recruits .
-LRB- White & Case says it counted Mr. Zelleke as African American because he requested it .
-RRB- LONDON -- In a move that could benefit both parties , South Africa is in discussions with the African Development Bank to become the lending institution 's 53rd member , and the last country on the African continent to join .
`` It is something that is agreed , '' said Babacar Ndiaye , president of the African Development Bank in Abidjan , Ivory Coast , in an interview .
`` The South African minister of foreign affairs , Alfred Nzo , was telling me recently that the position of the government is no longer a matter of ` if ' but a matter of ` when ' '' Pretoria would join .
Like other regional development banks and the World Bank , the ADB specializes in financing infrastructure projects .
It both finances those projects itself and acts as a lead manager , bringing in other lenders .
Estian Calitz , director general in the department of finance in Pretoria , confirmed that his government was discussing with bank officials the possibility of joining the ADB .
But he said : `` There is no estimate on when the country might join .
'' In a recent letter to South African Finance Minister Derek Keys , Mr. Ndaiye said that the benefits to South Africa would be `` tremendous .
'' In the interview , he estimated that the country would receive $ 200 million to $ 350 million a year for `` investment in education , health , utilities and employment-creation for a large segment of the population .
'' But he added that `` it is equally important to help South Africa restructure its economy to be more export-oriented , '' because it would lead to `` greater wealth , which in turn will help meet the social needs .
'' Membership also would allow South African companies to compete for $ 2.5 billion to $ 3 billion of projects that the ADB helps finance annually in Africa .
`` The strategy of some large corporations in South Africa should be changed to look for a direct penetration in Africa and to look for market opportunities for procurement , '' said Mr. Ndaiye .
He added that even if South African companies captured only 10 % or 15 % of the contracts , `` you can see the opportunity for job-creation and business-generation .
'' Moreover , he said South African companies `` will also be welcome to compete for projects financed by other institutions such as the World Bank .
'' Andrey Kidel , head of the overseas advisory group at S.G. Warburg & Co. in London , said , `` I can only see an upside for them South Africans joining the African Development Bank .
'' Furthermore , joining the ADB `` should increase the attraction of South African companies to overseas investors , '' said David Strongin , director of international finance at the Securities Industry Association in New York .
That could be important , since the amount of foreign investment flowing into South Africa has been disappointingly low .
Since multiparty talks on the future makeup of the South African government began in mid-1991 , U.S. investors have purchased a net $ 125 million of South African shares , $ 58 million of that in the first quarter of this year .
But analysts believe that many investors , deterred by violence in the country , have held back since then .
Noting the renewed militancy of local unions , Warren Myers , an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York , said : `` Investors -- both local and overseas -- fear that if the unions are militant , the economy and corporate profits could spiral downhill .
'' Other analysts noted that South African wages are already high by emerging-market standards .
Mr. Myers said investors were also concerned about who might succeed Nelson Mandela , South Africa 's 76-year-old president , and discouraged by the high valuation of South African shares , which are selling at 17 times per-share earnings .
Some observers contend that South Africa 's joining the development bank would be as beneficial to the lending institution as the country .
Although Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group reconfirmed the ADB 's triple-A credit rating last week , the ADB has been criticized for poor lending policies , poor operating procedures , permitting large arrears to build up and clashes among its members over its role .
Noting that South Africans `` may be more commercially minded than some of the current members of the ADB in the way they look at running the bank , '' Mr. Kidel of S.G. Warburg said : `` They would bring professional talent to the bank .
'' A U.S. banker who has worked with the institution added that South Africa , which likely would be granted a seat on the bank 's board and several senior administrative positions , could act as honest broker and help heal some of the rifts that have beset the bank .
He specifically pointed to the rivalry between English-speaking African countries and French-speaking ones , a split between Muslim and Christian African countries and the opposition of oil-exporting countries such as Nigeria , Algeria and Libya to nonregional bank members such as the U.S. and Japan .
`` Their vote could be used to democratize the political environment of the ADB , '' said the U.S. banker .
Mr. Ndiaye , the ADB president , said he has long dreamed that some day , perhaps in 10 years , a country like South Africa could play the same leading , benefactor role in the bank that Japan plays in the Asian Development Bank .
`` That implies , right now , on our part to make South Africa not a tiger for the continent , but certainly a lion , '' he said .
BIOSEPRA Corp. -LRB- Marlborough , Mass. -RRB- -- Jean-Marie Vogel , 43 years old , executive vice president and chief operating officer , was named president and chief executive officer , succeeding William E. Rich .
Dr. Rich , 50 , who was given the new title of vice chairman , said he will retain a `` planning role '' at BioSepra while pursuing other interests .
BioSepra makes products used by biotechnology companies to manufacture pharmaceuticals .
STARTER Corp. -LRB- New Haven , Conn. -RRB- -- John M. Tucker , 57 years old , a director of this sportswear company , was named president .
He succeeds David A. Beckerman , chairman and chief executive officer .
Mr. Tucker will take over day-to-day operations , effective Aug. 24 , to enable Mr. Beckerman to focus on acquisitions and expansion beyond its nine new retail stores , Mr. Beckerman said .
That clears the way for Pinault to buy the 64.6 % stake from French state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais .
Generale des Eaux and Pinault-Printemps-Redoute , Pinault 's publicly traded holding company , said that Generale des Eaux will keep its 33.3 % of FNAC and the two will become co-shareholders in a holding company that holds 97 % .
Pinault is acquiring the FNAC stake for 3,065 francs -LRB- $ 575.33 -RRB- a share , a price that values all of FNAC at three billion francs -LRB- $ 563.1 million -RRB- .
The FNAC acquisition adds yet another major new sector to a company that has more than doubled in size and has mutated constantly in the last three years .
Mr. Pinault 's acquisitions have left his group heavily indebted , but have built the company into one of France 's largest distribution companies , with 63 billion francs of revenue in 1993 , and 31.55 billion francs for the first half of 1994 .
A Credit Lyonnais spokeswoman said the bank would make a `` little capital gain , '' on the sale .
The troubled bank is selling its stake as part of Chairman Jean Peyrelevade 's strategy of shedding assets to stem the flow of red ink caused by a disastrous string of bad loans .
Jaguar , Volkswagen and Porsche produce more than their fair share of lemons , according to a review of chronic-defect complaints filed with the state of Florida .
The Florida review -- the most comprehensive such analysis in the country -- says General Motors Corp. 's Buick and Oldsmobile brands have the fewest complaints from consumers .
Toyota Motor Corp. 's Toyota and Lexus lines closely follow .
`` Quality is an issue we are addressing , '' a spokesman for Volkswagen AG said , `` and we 've got a lot of new product out there .
'' Similarly , Porsche AG said it has addressed several problems with its 911 sports car , which is redesigned for 1995 .
A spokesman for Ford Motor Co. 's Jaguar line conceded the car 's 1993 models had some problems .
However , it said its XJS coupe -- which performed poorly in the survey -- was `` substantially redesigned '' for 1994 , and a redesigned 1995 sedan will be launched this fall as part of a `` major '' effort to improve quality .
Daimler-Benz AG 's Mercedes also fared poorly in the Florida survey .
However , the company said its internal surveys , as well as studies by J.D. Power & Associates , an independent customer-survey firm , show most of its customers are `` very satisfied .
'' Several auto makers said they had n't seen the Florida study .
According to Florida 's Lemon Law Arbitration Program -- run through the state attorney general 's office -- relatively few car owners claim to be stuck with lemons -- cars with chronic , hard-to-repair defects .
But in Florida , notifying the state of such problems kicks off an arbitration process that ultimately can force an auto maker to fix defects or buy a car back .
Lemon laws are relatively common .
But only Florida does an in-depth review of the models and manufacturers that produce the most complaints of lemons as a percentage of sales .
Florida `` does the most thorough analysis '' said Paul Corning , administrator of the state of Washington 's lemon-law arbitration program .
The Florida study is a weighted analysis of 8,500 complaints received by the state from January 1992 through March 1994 .
All are complaints of nagging defects that arose during the first 24,000 miles of driving a car .
Under these guidelines , on average 2.3 % of Volkswagen buyers in Florida reported chronic defects .
The rate is 2.4 % for Jaguars and 2.7 % for Porsches .
By contrast , only 0.15 % of Oldsmobile purchasers reported chronic defects .
Among individual models , the Lexus coupe performed the best , with only 0.04 % of buyers complaining of chronic troubles , followed by the Geo Prizm , with complaints from 0.042 % of owners .
Geo is made by a Toyota-GM joint venture .
The worst performer by model was Chrysler 's Eagle Premier , which is no longer made .
It generated complaints from 5.9 % of buyers .
The Volkswagen Passat generated complaints from 4.7 % of buyers and the Jaguar XJS from 3.8 % .
J.D. Power 's 1994 Initial Quality Study also gave poor marks to Volkswagen , Jaguar and Porsche .
A Chrysler spokesman said the quality of its cars is improving .
It noted that in addition to the Premier , the company has stopped making several other vehicles that performed poorly on the Florida survey , including the Dodge Ramcharger .
Ranked by manufacturer , the sales-weighted analysis showed that the best of the Japanese makers continue to lead the industry .
Toyota and Honda had complaints in the 0.2 % to 0.3 % range .
Smaller Japanese makers -- Isuzu Motors Ltd. , Suzuki Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. -- had complaints in the 0.8 % to 1 % range .
The Big Three domestic auto makers performed below the leading Japanese , but far better than the smaller Japanese manufacturers .
GM 's complaint rate was 0.36 % .
At Ford the rate was 0.51 % and at Chrysler , 0.59 % .
South Korea 's Hyundai Motor Co. averaged 1.4 % -- a significant improvement from its 3 % rate in the 1989 -- 1991 study .
Among the European makes , Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Mercedes reported poor 1.6 % rates .
E.W. SCRIPPS Co. -LRB- Cincinnati -RRB- -- Craig C. Standen , 51 years old , was named senior vice president for corporate development at this media company , a position that has been vacant for four years .
Mr. Standen previously had served as vice president of marketing\/advertising for the company 's newspaper division since 1990 .
Before joining E.W. Scripps , he was president and chief executive officer of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau .
An inflation scare sent bond prices into a tailspin .
Stock prices followed the bond market 's lead and the dollar tumbled on increased tensions in U.S.-Japan trade talks .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 21.05 to 3755.43 , the average 's second-consecutive decline .
The Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index fell 2.00 to 463.17 and the Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.49 to 742.17 .
The benchmark 30-year Treasury long bond continued its retreat from Tuesday 's explosive gains , which were triggered by the Federal Reserve 's interest-rate boosts .
Yesterday 's decline was sparked , in part , by a Philadelphia Federal Reserve report that showed unsettling price boosts in that region 's manufacturing sector .
The bond market was also rattled by the dollar 's sharp fall against the yen , the result of hard-line comments by the U.S. and Japan over trade talks .
`` We 've managed to purge ourselves of Tuesday 's gains in the bond market quite quickly , '' said Elliott Platt , director of economic research at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette .
`` It looks like we have a rough road ahead of us for the next four to six weeks .
'' In the stock market , analysts are increasingly fixated on a possible slowdown in the economy and the harm that would pose for corporate earnings .
Stocks , like bonds , have backtracked from Tuesday 's gains following the Fed 's rate increases .
`` We 've had five rate increases this year , and it gives you pause to think about what kind of impact that will have , '' said Larry Rice , chief market strategist for Josephthal , Lyon & Ross .
`` Right now , I 'm taking a cautious approach .
'' World-wide , stock prices rose in dollar terms .
The Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 0.48 to 119.04 .
Stock prices dropped .
Volume totaled 285 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange , where 1,299 issues declined and 890 advanced .
Bond prices fell .
The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year issue fell more than one point , or more than $ 10 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to yield 7.48 % .
The dollar dropped .
In late New York trading the currency was quoted at 1.5430 marks and 98.57 yen compared with 1.5525 marks and 100.21 yen Wednesday .
WASHINGTON -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved a bill substantially restoring local governments ' authority to commandeer trash for municipally financed treatment plants and incinerators .
The panel voted , in effect , to undo key parts of a Supreme Court ruling on May 16 that said local governments ca n't prohibit trash haulers from shipping garbage to other states where disposal costs may be cheaper .
Garbage `` flow-control '' ordinances were designed to capture revenues for local trash facilities , but the high court said that is n't a good enough reason to interfere with interstate commerce .
The court 's ruling has thrown a cloud of uncertainty over the creditworthiness of billions of dollars of tax-exempt bonds that were sold to finance trash facilities on the expectation that local flow-control ordinances would assure them sufficient business .
The decision also appeared to block such projects in the future .
The Energy and Commerce panel 's bill , championed by Rep. Frank Pallone -LRB- D. , N.J. -RRB- , contains broad `` grandfather '' provisions to protect projects that existed or were planned before the Supreme Court 's decision .
The measure also would permit the use of flow control in the future in the case of residential trash , but generally would bar it for commercial waste .
The committee rejected , 20-13 , an amendment by Rep. Bill Richardson -LRB- R. , N.M. -RRB- , that sought to provide narrower relief from the high court 's decision .
By voice votes , it then approved the Pallone alternative and ordered the bill reported to the House .
Rep. Al Swift -LRB- D. , Wash. -RRB- , a supporter of the Pallone alternative , argued that many taxpayers face substantial tax increases unless Congress grants substantial relief from the Supreme Court decision .
Rep. Richardson said the Pallone approach would be too broad , effectively giving local governments monopoly powers .
Lawmakers on both sides of the debate predicted further legislative tinkering before , or when , the bill goes to the House floor after Labor Day .
Counterpart legislation has been proposed in the Senate .
Representatives of the National Association of Bond Lawyers and the Public Securities Association , a bond trade group , praised the Energy and Commerce Committee bill .
BENEFICIAL Corp. , Wilmington , Del. , raised the quarterly dividend 13 % , to 43 cents from 38 cents a share , payable Sept. 30 to stock of record Sept. 1 .

'' The financial-services holding company has consumer-finance , banking and insurance operations .
TOKYO -- Japan 's overall wholesale prices during the first 10 days of August rose 0.1 % from the previous 10 days and were down 1.3 % from a year earlier , the Bank of Japan reported .
Japan 's overall wholesale prices in July , the latest full month for which price data are available , fell 0.2 % from June and were down 2.0 % from the year-earlier month .
Domestic wholesale prices in July were unchanged from June and fell 1.7 % from a year earlier .
Domestic wholesale prices , which make up roughly 80 % of the overall index , softened in the first 10 days of August as sales competition heated up in the electronics sector , particularly for calculators .
Although prices of eggs and beef rose in the period , those of certain processed foods declined .

STOCKHOLM -- Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson reported a 78 % surge in pretax profit for the first six months of 1994 and predicted further improvement in the full year .
The telecommunications group said first-half profit , which rose to 2.29 billion kronor -LRB- $ 291.1 million -RRB- from 1.29 billion kronor , was supported by strong sales trends .
Group sales rose 33 % to 36.51 billion kronor in the period with all business areas contributing to the advance .
Sales were particularly strong in Japan , the U.S. , Australia and China .
Order bookings were also higher , rising 19 % to 40.34 billion kronor , bolstered by a few large orders received from China , Sweden and Italy , the company said .
Ericsson said in a forecast that `` positive '' trends are expected to continue through the rest of the year .
`` Full-year earnings will be considerably better than in 1993 , '' the company said .
The profit improvement was attributed to expansion in radio communications , including mobile phones .
Radio communications has expanded sharply over the past year and now accounts for half of Ericsson 's order bookings and nearly half of consolidated net sales .
Radio communications contributed 17.14 billion kronor to group sales in the first half , up 61 % from 10.65 billion kronor a year earlier .

He succeeds John B. Ashmun , a founder of Wainoco , who resigned from the board in May for personal reasons .
NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group lowered its ratings on Prudential Insurance Co. of America and related units , affecting about $ 4 billion of debt and securities .
S&P also lowered its `` financial-programs '' ratings for the Prudential Securities Group Inc. and its broker-dealer unit , where potential claims over sales of limited partnerships have required the parent to inject capital .
In response , Prudential said it was disappointed by the S&P announcement , as well as with its own recent financial results , which led to the rating decision .
And it said it disagreed with S&P 's changes in the Prudential Securities rating .
`` The brokerage firm has taken substantial steps to put the uncertainty about limited partnership claims behind it and The Prudential has demonstrated its commitment to stand by its subsidiary , '' the company said .
S&P lowered the parent 's senior-debt and claims-paying-ability ratings to double-A from double-A-plus .
S&P affirmed its single-A-1-plus rating on commercial paper and removed the ratings from its CreditWatch list ; the ratings had been under review for about a month .
This rating action reflects Prudential 's `` disappointing earnings performance in 1994 and S&P 's belief that earnings will not fully recover to historical levels in the near future , '' the S&P announcement said .
S&P said it believes Prudential 's earnings `` will fall considerably short '' of prior expectations .
Among negative factors , it noted the $ 305 million addition to reserves for potential claims concerning the limited partnerships ; cyclical downturn in the broker-dealer business ; over $ 200 million in adverse claims related to harsh winter storms and the recent California earthquake ; sharply depressed results at Prudential Home Mortgage Co. ; and the costs of restructuring and re-engineering Prudential 's individual insurance units .
But S&P also cited `` the continued good performance '' of asset-management and group-insurance units and said the company retains `` considerable strengths '' and has sound capitalization .
S&P lowered its financial-programs ratings of Prudential Securities Group to triple-B-plus\/single-A -2 from singleA\/single-A -1 .
Those changes reflect the parent 's downgrade as well as financial strain on Prudential Securities from `` high legal expenses , poor market conditions , and deteriorating profitability , '' S&P said .
PITTSBURGH -- Michael Baker Corp. said its Michael Baker Jr. .
Inc. subsidiary was selected by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to negotiate a new technical evaluation contract valued at more than $ 50 million over the next five years .

FRANKFURT -- German drug maker Schering AG charged that German drug authorities are `` overreacting '' in launching a formal investigation into the potential cancer risks of drugs that contain the synthetic sex hormone cyproterone acetate .
Earlier this week , in response to testtube trials by German and Italian scientists hinting at a possible causal link with liver cancer , the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices opened a probe into two Schering drugs .
The first , Diane 35 , is a treatment for acne and facial hair for women ; the other , Androcur , is a therapy for enlarged prostate glands and prostate cancer in men .
Both drugs have been available in international markets for more than a decade .
At a news conference yesterday , Schering officials insisted that medicines cited by German regulators as alternatives to Diane 35 and Androcur are less effective and have similar side effects .

SEOUL -- South Korea had a trade deficit of $ 703 million in July , sharply wider than a deficit of $ 532 million a year ago .
The Trade , Industry and Energy Ministry , in its final report on the trade balance for July , said the nation 's exports rose 15 % from a year ago to $ 7.64 billion last month against a growth of 15.9 % for imports totaling $ 8.34 billion .
In its tentative report in early August , the ministry said the nation posted a trade deficit of $ 677 million in July .
The preliminary report showed that exports rose 15 % to $ 7.66 billion , while imports went up 15.9 % to $ 8.34 billion .
The ministry 's final report showed that the nation 's cumulative trade deficit widened to $ 4.3 billion in the first seven months of this year from $ 3 billion a year ago .
In July , South Korea continued to run a chronic trade deficit with Japan .
It reached $ 904 million last month , but was the first shortage under $ 1 billion since March , the ministry said .
The nation 's January-to-July trade shortfall with Japan stood at $ 6.8 billion , becoming the single largest factor in South Korea 's swelling trade unbalance .
`` As South Korea 's economy picks up , imports of electronics parts for exports and machinery were brisk last month , '' said a ministry spokesman .
In trade with the U.S. , South Korea posted a trade deficit of $ 39 million last month , according to the ministry .
The cumulative trade deficit so far this year stands at $ 396 million as South Korea continues to see sluggish exports to the U.S. of such light-industry goods as toys , textiles , and footwear .
Semiconductors continued to lead South Korea 's exports in July , with shipments reaching $ 1.1 billion .
Shipments of semiconductors in June surpassed the one billion mark for the first time as a single item .

Consumer spending is a major component of Japan 's economy , representing about 60 % of the nation 's gross domestic product .
OTTAWA -- Major Canadian wage settlements reached in June provided no increase in wages , the Canadian government 's labor bureau said .
The low figure was largely influenced by wage restraint programs of the federal and several provincial governments .
More than 86 % of all employees covered by the June settlements were subject to wage rollbacks or wage freezes .
Wage settlements in May provided an average annual increase of 0.3 % and April settlements provided an average 0.4 % increase .
STUTTGART , Germany -- Pharmaceutical wholesaler Gehe AG reported that first-half pretax profit more than doubled to 113 million marks -LRB- $ 72.8 million -RRB- , which it attributed to its mid-1993 acquisition of French pharmaceutical wholesaler Office Commercial Pharmaceutique SA .
Excluding the OCP operations , Gehe 's group sales rose 11 % in the first half of 1994 , to 2.72 billion marks .
First-half profit excluding the OCP acquisition `` clearly improved , '' the company said in a letter to shareholders .

WASHINGTON -- Academic medical centers have emerged as big winners in Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell 's health bill .
But now they are a big target to foes on the Senate floor .
As proposed in the Maine Democrat 's bill , teaching hospitals , medical schools and biomedical researchers would get nearly $ 75 billion in subsidies over the five years beginning in 1997 .
While much of that funding would replace existing Medicare stipends for academic centers , the Mitchell bill also would create new financing streams targeted specifically at medical schools and research .
Leading sponsors include influential Senate committee chairmen Daniel Moynihan of New York and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts , whose states are well-stocked with academic medical centers .
Executives of the centers hail the bill 's provisions as the fruit of an intensive , year-long lobbying effort .
`` I think it 's the best we can do , '' says Mitchell Rabkin , president of Boston 's Beth Israel Hospital .
`` The real concern is : Can we keep it ?
'' Not if some rural-state Democrats and conservative Republicans have their way .
Sen. Max Baucus , a Montana Democrat , sees the subsidies as an excessive boon to big-city centers .
`` About half of the fund will go to hospitals on the East Coast , '' he says , while rural areas continue to go underserved .
But rather than try to kill the funding , Sen. Baucus will seek to redirect a portion to rural hospitals .
Still another threat is an expected attack from Republicans , such as Wyoming Sen. Malcolm Wallop and Texas Sen. Phil Gramm , who are taking aim at a proposed 1.75 % tax on insurance premiums in the Mitchell bill .
Killing the assessment would eliminate the new revenues that are intended mostly for the medical centers , with one-seventh for biomedical research .
And a third conflict could erupt if Democrats ca n't agree on how much or how little the government should do to steer young doctors to careers as primary-care providers instead of specialists .
To some critics , the academic medical centers ' quest for more public subsidies is odd , given the large private endowments that many of the facilities possess .
But Michael Johns , dean of the Johns Hopkins University Medical School , maintains : `` We 're not wealthy .
'' Centers such as Hopkins are under growing pressure from insurers to lower rates for patient care , thus providing less money for research and teaching costs , Dr. Johns says .
`` If our funding gets knocked out of the Mitchell bill , we 'd be at great risk , '' he asserts .
Specifically , the Mitchell bill would provide $ 73.5 billion in subsidies for academic health centers in the five years beginning with 1997 .
Most of that money would come from four revenue streams .
From 1997 through 2001 , $ 24.2 billion is earmarked for graduate medical education .
Another $ 41.8 billion is targeted for academic health centers .
Medical schools would get $ 2 billion .
And medical research stands to collect a 0.25 % tax on all private insurance premiums , for a potential $ 5.5 billion over the five years .
Both sides of the debate are likely to draw support from a recent cost analysis by Lewin-VHI Inc. , a Fairfax , Va. , consultant , on behalf of the American Association of Medical Colleges .
Lewin-VHI concluded that indirect medical education costs at teaching hospitals will amount to $ 14.1 billion to $ 16.4 billion in the year 2000 .
That 's more money than the Mitchell bill provides .
But Lewin-VHI says it is n't clear that teaching hospitals will need subsidies to cover that full amount .
The teaching hospitals may be able to charge more for top-quality patient care , or they may become more efficient , the consultants said .
If either of those conditions occur , Lewin-VHI said , a smaller stipend for teaching hospitals should suffice .
Unlike most other health-care interest groups , academic medical centers have n't relied on political contributions , advertising or grass-roots phone and mail campaigns .
Instead , their lead lobbyists have been hospital presidents and medical school deans who have come to Washington to plead their case with legislators and White House officials .
Those face-to-face sessions have been a mix of upbeat talk about what medical research can do , and dire warnings of setbacks if funds are n't forthcoming .
Among the most frequent visitors has been Herbert Pardes , dean of the Columbia University School of Medicine in New York , who estimates he has made 50 visits to Washington in the past year to argue the medical schools ' case .
Dr. Pardes says his standard message is : `` Academic medical centers are enormously valuable to the entire society .
We 're where most of the advances in research and understanding disease take place .
If we do n't keep academic centers strong , the ability of medicine to keep pushing the frontier will be sorely undermined .
'' That argument has played well with lawmakers from states that would benefit .
In particular , Sen. Moynihan `` has been a great champion for all of us , '' says William Peck , dean of the school of medicine at Washington University , St. Louis .
As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , Sen. Moynihan pushed the subsidies earlier this summer in his health bill , over the opposition of Sen. Baucus , other rural-state senators and some Republicans on the panel .
Sen. Mitchell then included them in his revised plan .
And last week , at the start of Senate debate , Sen. Moynihan declared : `` We are in the great age of medical discovery in health care .
'' He hailed breakthroughs in treating heart disease , cancer and ulcers .
Despite such influential backing , rural-state senators take heart that they can alter the provisions .
Lawmakers from the western and southern states enjoy greater clout in the Senate as opposed to the House , where seats are apportioned based on population .
In addition , the Democratic foes count on votes from many Republicans .
Although funding is the most contentious issue involving academic medical centers , even backers of the Mitchell bill are divided on guidelines for the training of young doctors .
Some liberal and rural Democrats , led by Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia , would like to see Congress spell out targets for creating more primary-care doctors and fewer specialists , and for limiting the overall number of residency training programs .
They say such provisions , which were in the original White House health bill , would boost the ranks of doctors available to serve less-populated areas since specialists are drawn to urban centers .
But Sen. Moynihan wants academic medical centers to have maximum freedom in running their training programs .
He contends that the number of specialists is determined by scientific breakthroughs and is `` an independent variable that has nothing to do with primary care .
'' In the Senate last weekend , he opposed the provisions in no uncertain terms .
`` This is hubristic .
This invites the wrath of the gods .
This invites the death , the closing of a great moment of medical discovery , unprecedented on Earth , '' he said .
`` This is , I may say ... a sin against the Holy Ghost .
'' TOKYO -- Honda Motor Co. signed an agreement with China 's Mindong Electric -LRB- Group -RRB- Co. to set up a joint venture for production and sales of small gasoline-powered generators in China .
The major Japanese auto maker said the venture is capitalized at $ 6 million and 60 % - owned by Honda and 40 % - owned by the Chinese partner , which specializes in power products and electric appliances .
The joint venture will produce small generators to be used for lighting at public facilities , stores and construction sites .
The initial production will be about 40,000 units annually , but will be raised to 80,000 by 1998 .
SEOUL , South Korea -- Daewoo Heavy Industries Co. said it signed a joint-venture agreement with China 's Jinan Bus Factory to produce buses in Jinan , China .
Daewoo is a unit of Daewoo Group .
The venture , named Jinan Daewoo Bus Co. , will be capitalized at $ 22.4 million , with Daewoo financing 60 % .
Operations will start in July 1995 , with an annual capacity of 2,000 buses in initial years .
The venture will eventually expand its capacity to 5,000 units a year , an official said .
OAK BROOK , Ill. -- Pinnacle Banc Group Inc. said it definitively agreed to acquire closely held Acorn Financial Corp. for $ 23 million .
Acorn , the parent of Suburban Trust & Savings Bank of Oak Park , Ill. , has assets of about $ 150 million .
Pinnacle , a bank holding concern , has assets of $ 705 million .

MUNCIE , Ind. -- Alltrista Corp. said it signed a letter of intent to buy the Bernardin of Canada Ltd. unit of American National Can Co. .
Terms of the cash pact , which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter , were n't disclosed .
Toronto-based Bernardin is a maker and marketer of home canning products .
Its parent , American National Can , is a unit of Pechiney SA , the French aluminum and packaging giant .
Alltrista , which makes home canning products under the Ball brand name , said the pact is subject to a definitive agreement and approval by directors of both corporations .
WELLINGTON , New Zealand -- New Zealand 's unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in more than four years , giving weight to central bank concern that burgeoning economic growth could put pressure on wage demands and ultimately inflation .
The country 's unemployment rate fell to 8.4 % at the end of June , from 9 % at the end of March and 9.9 % in June 1993 .
The number of people employed rose 11,000 , or 7.7 % , in the latest quarter to 1.54 million , and in the 12 months to June rose 3.9 % , or 58,000 .
Unemployment is at its lowest level since September 1990 , while employment is at its highest since December 1987 .

Varity is an industrial management company , with core businesses in automotive parts and diesel engines .
NEW YORK -- Program trading in the week ended Aug. 12 accounted for 7.3 % , or an average 18.6 million daily shares , of New York Stock Exchange volume .
Brokerage firms executed an additional 16.4 million daily shares of program trading away from the Big Board , mostly on foreign markets .
Program trading is the simultaneous purchase or sale of at least 15 different stocks with a total value of $ 1 million or more .
Of the program total on the Big Board , 39.1 % involved stock-index arbitrage , up from 28.3 % in the previous week .
In this strategy , traders dart between stocks and stock-index options and futures to capture fleeting price differences .
Some 53.6 % of program trading was executed by firms for their own accounts , or principal trading , and 45.6 % was for their customers .
Another 0.8 % was customer facilitation , in which firms use principal positions to facilitate customer trades .
Of the five most-active firms , Nomura Securities , Kidder Peabody and Cooper Neff executed all or most of their program trading for their own accounts , while Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns did most of their trading for their customers .
NEW YORK -- Continental Corp. eliminated its annual dividend of $ 1 a share in an effort to bolster the insurer 's capital base .
Continental , the nation 's 11th-largest property-and-casualty insurer , also confirmed that it hired Goldman , Sachs & Co. to `` review alternatives for raising additional capital .
'' Investors took the expected dividend action in stride , buoyed by the hope that Goldman will be able to find a source of new capital to shore up the company 's financial underpinnings , battered by a decade of strategic mistakes and natural disasters .
After the announcement , Continental 's stock rose 62.5 cents to close at $ 17.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday .
`` Eliminating the dividend is a pretty drastic step , '' said James Ramenda , an analyst with Northington Partners , an insurance-research firm .
`` It signals they 're determined to turn it around , although it 's too early to say it actually will occur , '' he said .
The twin actions are the latest and most drastic in the ailing insurer 's long quest to improve profitability .
Continental has been disappointing investors with poor earnings since the 1970s , when it was left saddled with mounting insurance claims after a vicious battle for market share with competitors .
A string of restructuring efforts has so far fallen short of promises .
The latest moves are viewed by many analysts as an effort to avoid ratings downgrades by ratings concerns A.M. Best & Co. and Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group that could sharply reduce Continental 's competitiveness .
Several people familiar with the company 's plans said the New York-based insurer is seeking a cash infusion of about $ 300 million in the form of a sale of preferred stock .
Goldman already has made pitches to potential investors , one person said .
But finding an investor wo n't be easy , analysts said .
One obstacle could be the company 's exposure to pollution liabilities from insurance coverage it sold in the 1970s .
`` They probably have above-average liability , yet they have below-average reserves , '' said Michael Smith , an analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc. `` Anyone who makes an investment in Continental will have to recognize that there is a black hole in the balance sheet , and nobody knows how deep it is .
'' Analysts said possible sources of the equity infusion include Trident Partnership , an investment group connected to Marsh & McLennan Cos. , an insurance brokerage concern , and J.P. Morgan & Co. ; Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts , the leveraged-buyout firm that has invested in insurance companies ; and John Head & Partners , an investment partnership with insurance interests .
John Snyder , a senior vice president with A.M. Best , said the firm 's decision later this year on Continental 's rating would hinge on the size of the investment , its terms and the credibility of the investor .
He said Continental apparently is trying to duplicate the experience of Alexander & Alexander Services Inc. , a long-beleaguered insurance broker whose stock price soared after American International Group Inc. injected $ 200 million in capital .
Mr. Snyder said AIG 's vote of confidence in Alexander & Alexander was as important as the money .
The elimination of Continental 's common-stock dividend will save the insurer about $ 55 million a year , a sum that the company is expected to use to pay a dividend on preferred stock to be issued to a potential investor .
The people familiar with the company 's plans said the company had concluded that it could n't afford both the current common-stock dividend and a preferred payout .
The capital infusion is needed to allay concerns among rating concerns that the company might n't have adequate capital to weather unusually large future claims , whether from catastrophes or pollution cases .
Analysts said the company 's capital has fallen to lower-than-desired , albeit not dangerous , levels , as a result of the company 's meager profits and the costly dividend .
Mr. Snyder said Continental 's already-high debt-to-equity ratio -- 47 % vs. an industry average of less than 30 % -- precluded additional borrowings to beef up the capital .
And a stock offering would seriously dilute the existing shares at current trading prices .
The company did announce yesterday some additional spending cuts , saying its layoffs this year would total about 2,000 , or 16 % of its work force of 12,255 , instead of the previously announced 14 % .
Just two decades ago , Continental was one of the nation 's premier commercial insurance companies .
But ill-timed strategic moves and a string of catastrophes , mostly related to bad weather , crippled it .
Its biggest single problem is its focus on `` commercial packaging '' for middle-market companies .
Commercial packagers bundle various insurance lines for customers , one of the industry 's most price-sensitive sectors .
`` The commercial-package product is the most commodity-like product in the insurance industry , '' said Mr. Smith , the Lehman Brothers analyst .
Not only is that market extremely price-competitive , but it also is in the trough of an unusually long weak-pricing cycle , he said .
Among strategic moves that have n't worked out for Continental exactly as planned is a decision in the mid-1980s to develop new business through a select group of independent agents .
The aim was twofold : cut costs by eliminating dealings with low-volume agents , while building up loyalty among remaining agents .
The idea was that those remaining agents would throw Continental their best underwriting prospects in return .
The move quickly was dubbed `` shoot-the-stragglers program , '' and it fast became evident that instead of increasing loyalty , a sizable number of the remaining agents feared they would be the next to go .
So , some sent their best underwriting business to other insurers , and Continental got only the leftovers .
For the past decade , Scott Sperling has been Harvard Management Co. 's point man in the realm of risky investments .
In 1984 , at the age of 26 , the Harvard Business School graduate was appointed to manage Aeneas Group , Harvard University 's $ 150 million portfolio of investments in real estate , oil and gas , and venture-capital projects .
Five years later , when Mr. Sperling 's annual compensation hit $ 1 million , the portfolio was worth nearly seven times that amount .
And his reputation was growing even faster than his wallet .
By the time he was 30 , Mr. Sperling was quoted in newspapers throughout the country -- including this one -- as an expert on leveraged buyouts and other forms of direct investments .
And the performance on the direct investments he manages for Harvard has improved since 1991 .
But at the end of this month Mr. Sperling will quietly leave Harvard Management to join Thomas H. Lee Co. , a Boston leveraged-buyout firm .
His low-key departure , coupled with considerable evidence that he has n't been thriving under Jack R. Meyer , the president of Harvard Management since late 1990 , is prompting rumors that he has been nudged out of the job he has held for a decade .
Not so , says Mr. Sperling .
While he concedes that under the circumstances such rumors are `` natural , '' he says they are nothing but `` completely unfounded speculation .
'' `` It 's very difficult to leave a great place like the Harvard Management Co. , '' he says , `` but the prospect of working with Tom Lee and his partners is for me a unique and exciting opportunity .
'' And people close to Harvard Management back up Mr. Sperling 's assertion .
Floyd Kvamme , a partner at the venture-capital firm Kleiner , Perkins , Caufield & Byers and a member of the Aeneas board of directors , says he 's `` amazed '' at the suggestion that Mr. Sperling may have been forced out of his job .
`` That 's just not so , '' he says .
Mr. Lee says he did n't offer Mr. Sperling a job until Mr. Sperling approached him in June to discuss several other jobs he was considering taking .
By that time , Mr. Lee says , Mr. Sperling had already decided to leave Harvard Management .
`` Scott had at least three different opportunities that I know of , '' Mr. Lee says .
`` It was after learning about those that I got interested in him .
'' Mr. Lee says he reached an agreement to hire Mr. Sperling in mid-July .
Thomas Lee Co. has for several years had a close relationship with Harvard Management , which is a limited partner in the firm .
In at least one case , Mr. Sperling and a Lee representative both sit on the board of directors of a company owned by Harvard and the Lee company .
There are ample reasons that a seasoned investment professional might look elsewhere than Harvard Management .
Mr. Sperling had been the focus of criticism at Harvard for his seemingly high compensation compared to senior faculty and administration salaries .
Indeed , his compensation at the Lee firm includes an equity stake , something Harvard could never match .
Mr. Sperling also is understood to have grown weary of dealing with hard-to-please Harvard faculty and alumni , and with the intense scrutiny that comes with managing the riskiest portion of the nation 's largest university endowment .
`` Certainly nobody relishes continual public scrutiny of everything one does , '' says Philip Cooper , chairman and chief executive officer of Rogers Casey Alternative Investment Corp. and a friend of Mr. Sperling 's .
But Mr. Sperling also has endured a series of setbacks under Mr. Meyer , a well-regarded investment professional with a reputation as a tough manager .
During Mr. Meyer 's first full year at Harvard , an independent review of the then - $ 1.2 billion Aeneas portfolio -- the value of which helped Mr. Sperling earn his seven-figure income in 1989 -- resulted in its being devalued by $ 200 million .
Several of the investments that were written down to zero had been maintained on the books for years at their full purchase price , even though the firms had been losing money .
Mr. Meyer also created a new board of directors to oversee Mr. Sperling and Michael Eisenson , a friend whom Mr. Sperling brought aboard as a partner in 1986 .
What 's more , Mr. Meyer overhauled Aeneas 's compensation schedule so that bonuses would be based on long-term , realized gains , rather than short-term estimates of performance .
Then , in December 1993 , Mr. Meyer and the Aeneas board reorganized the division more significantly , naming Mr. Meyer chairman and Mr. Eisenson president .
Mr. Sperling was relegated to the position of vice chairman of the group he had essentially built during the 1980s .
As of this past July 1 , Aeneas was renamed Harvard Private Capital Group Inc. .
Mr. Meyer refused to comment on any aspect of this story .
To be sure , even his detractors concede Mr. Sperling is very bright , and an able investment manager .
And he does have his staunch supporters .
Alan M. Leventhal , president of Beacon Properties Corp. , a recently formed real-estate investment trust launched with Harvard money , says Mr. Sperling is `` an exceptional individual .
'' `` I 've rarely seen that type of intellectual ability and insightfulness , '' Mr. Leventhal says .
But impressive though such returns may be , Harvard 's performance trails that of several other leading universities , including Yale , which returned 17.3 % on its $ 3.2 billion endowment last year , and which has outperformed Harvard in eight of the past 10 years .
People close to Harvard Management say that lag has increased the pressure on Mr. Meyer to improve the management company 's performance .
`` If you look at the comparative results , you would n't say , ` Yippee , ' '' says Ernest Monrad , a Harvard alumnus and money manager .
`` We 're not doing as well competitively as we should .
And there 's a natural feeling that Harvard should be the best , because it is in most things .
'' HOUSTON -- Ashland Exploration Inc. , a subsidiary of Ashland , Ky.-based Ashland Oil Inc. , said an affiliate has made a discovery in the first oil well of a new exploratory program in Nigeria .
The affiliate , Ashland Nigeria Exploration Unlimited , made the discovery at the Okwori South No. 1 well , an offshore location .
GOLETA , Calif. -- Applied Magnetics Corp. said it is cutting 125 jobs at its operations here as part of a cost-reduction program .
The company , which makes magnetic heads for computer disk and tape drives , said the move is part of a previously announced turnaround strategy .
MILFORD , Ohio -- Structural Dynamics Research Corp. said Boeing Co. selected it as primary supplier of product data management software and consulting services .
Boeing has placed an initial order with Structural Dynamics valued at $ 8 million .
The Ohio company estimates orders for software and consulting services resulting from the agreement could near $ 20 million over the next three years , making it one of the largest orders in its history .
EATONTOWN , N.J. -- Roberts Pharmaceutical Corp. said it reached an agreement with Glaxo Canada Inc. for exclusive U.S. rights to market the Eltroxin brand of levothyroxine sodium tablets , a synthetic thyroid drug .
Roberts said it plans to launch the drug , which will be manufactured in Glaxo Canada , a unit of Glaxo Holdings PLC , within the next month .
ELKHART , Ind. -- Excel Industries Inc. said its board authorized the repurchase of as many as 300,000 shares , or 2.7 % , of the company 's common stock .
The maker of window and door systems for the automotive market said any shares repurchased under the authorization will be used for the company 's 1994 stock-compensation plan .
LOS ANGELES -- Teledyne Inc. said it agreed to sell its electronic-systems unit to Litton Industries Inc. .
The price of the cash purchase was n't disclosed .
But analysts and other industry officials have suggested the Teledyne operations could fetch between $ 50 million and $ 70 million .
The transaction would n't include Teledyne 's Lewisburg , Tenn. , operations or any of the current electronic-systems unit 's real estate in Southern California .
For Teledyne , an aviation and industrial-products conglomerate , the sale is part of a move to dispose of some defense-related and other operations .
Teledyne President Donald Rice said selling the business to Litton , based in Beverly Hills , Calif. , would provide the operations with `` stronger future prospects in a consolidating defense market , '' while allowing Teledyne to focus on areas where its market position is stronger .
For Litton , a maker of defense electronics and combat ships with more than $ 3.5 billion in annual sales , the acquisition would bolster its navigation and control-systems segment .
That business had sales last year of about $ 810 million .
Buying the Teledyne business would also help Litton paint itself as an acquirer at an important time , since many on Wall Street have been speculating Litton itself may be bought up by one of a number of larger potential buyers .
Earlier this week , Litton adopted a so-called poison-pill defense , declaring a distribution on Aug. 31 of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding common share , exercisable if another party acquires 15 % or more of Litton stock or announces a tender offer that would result in ownership of 15 % or more .
Each right will also entitle the holder to buy common shares at half price .
ANDROS Inc. -LRB- Berkeley , Calif. -RRB- -- Edward McClatchie , 52 years old , was elected a director of this instrument maker .
Mr. McClatchie is senior vice president of sales and corporate development .

LONDON -- British retail sales volume rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 % in July from June and was up 3.8 % from a year earlier , the Central Statistical Office said .
The July increase compared with market forecasts of rises of 0.3 % on the month and 3.7 % on the year .
SOUTHFIELD , Mich. -- Federal-Mogul Corp. said it agreed to acquire 90 % of the common shares and convertible debentures of Varex Corp. .
Ltd. , a large South African auto-parts distributor , for $ 49.5 million .
Federal-Mogul , which makes and distributes auto parts for the replacement and original equipment markets , said it will make an offer to purchase Varex 's remaining shares and debentures .
The company will also acquire the assets and aftermarket retail business of Southspare , a South Africa-based aftermarket distributor that Varex is in the process of acquiring .
Federal-Mogul said it will pay about $ 55 million for 100 % of Varex , including Southspare .
The offer and acquisitions are subject to regulatory approval in South Africa and should be completed during the fourth quarter of this year .
Together , Varex and Southspare , based in Johannesburg , generate $ 120 million in combined annual sales and employ 1,200 .
Federal-Mogul , which had sales of $ 1.6 billion in 1993 , said the agreement is part of its broad international growth strategy , which includes opening nearly 100 retail auto-parts stores outside the U.S. by the end of this year .
The Varex acquisition would add 30 retail outlets to Federal-Mogul 's existing 26 outside the U.S. .
The company does not have a U.S. retail business .
The move also marks Federal-Mogul 's return to South Africa .
The company once owned FEMO , a replacement-part distributor in Johannesburg , but sold it to the company that later became Varex in 1988 because of apartheid-related economic sanctions .
Dennis J. Gormley , Federal-Mogul 's chairman and chief executive officer , said Federal-Mogul will `` further increase the efficiency of this business .
'' He added , `` Although South Africa faces many challenges as it implements massive social and political reform , we are confident the country is moving in the right direction .
'' In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Federal-Mogul closed yesterday at $ 27.875 , unchanged .
PITTSBURGH -- An international consortium led by closely held Custom Coals Corp. signed an agreement with the Chinese government to build an $ 890 million coal slurry pipeline in China .
The pipeline project , expected to be the world 's longest coal pipeline , includes a 500-mile underground pipeline , a $ 150 million coal-cleaning plant and port facilities .
The consortium will own 51 % of the project .
The Chinese government , through China Coal Construction & Development Corp. , will own the rest .
After 50 years , the consortium 's stake will be transferred to the Chinese government .
Custom Coals is a Pittsburgh-based developer of proprietary coal cleaning technology .
The company operates a coal plant in Dilltown , Pa. , and has assets of about $ 15 million .
Custom Coals will be the lead manager in the project with a 47 % share in the international consortium , named China Pipeline Holdings Ltd. .
Other members of the consortium include MRI Ltd. , an Australian subsidiary of China Strategic Holdings Group , a diversified holding company with interests in tire , beer , paper and pharmaceuticals ; Willbros Butler Engineers Inc. , the construction contractor ; and Williams Technologies Services , the pipeline operator .

CHICAGO -- U.S. tractor sales rose 5.8 % in July from a year earlier .
Farm-equipment makers sold 7,614 wheeled tractors last month compared with 7,199 during July 1993 , according to Equipment Manufacturers Institute , a trade group .
CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said a full membership sold for $ 925,000 , topping a record of $ 800,000 set late last month .
TOKYO -- Sony Corp. reported a 39 % decline in consolidated pretax profit for the first quarter ended June 30 , reflecting the strong yen and a continuing slump in the company 's movie business .
While the strength of the yen accounted for the bulk of Sony 's profit decline , analysts said the poor showing from Hollywood reflects deeper problems in Sony 's management of its 1989 Columbia Pictures acquisition .
While Sony does n't report separate profit figures for its movie business , many analysts believe it has been losing money in that segment for some time .
`` The movie business is really dragging down the whole operation , '' said Chuck Goto , an analyst with Smith Barney Inc. in Tokyo .
`` They really need to clean it up .
'' Overall , Sony said its consolidated first-quarter sales rose 4.3 % , to 864.52 billion yen -LRB- $ 8.66 billion -RRB- from 828.71 billion yen in the year-earlier period , even as pretax profit fell by more than a third to 23.58 billion yen from 38.63 billion yen .
Net income for the first quarter fell 49 % to 3.91 billion yen from 7.69 billion yen .
Sony officials blamed the decline in profit largely on a falloff in the company 's foreign-exchange earnings .
As the yen surged last year during the first quarter , Sony was able to hedge aggressively , and reaped big rewards .
Thanks to the yen 's slower rise this year , however , the company 's foreign-exchange gains from currency hedging fell 63 % to 7.5 billion yen , down from 20.38 billion yen a year earlier .
Sales of consumer electronics , which have been depressed for several years , accounted for much of Sony 's surprisingly strong revenue gains .
Despite the high yen , which hurts exporters like Sony by making goods produced in Japan more expensive overseas , the company 's electronics sales jumped 4.1 % to 692.1 billion yen , led by a surprising 10 % increase in television sales .
Sony 's movie revenue , however , fell 4.3 % to 64.27 billion yen , even as sales from its music operations rose 12 % to 108.15 billion yen .
Even in local-currency terms , which are n't skewed by the yen 's rise , the movie unit eked out only a tiny 1 % increase in sales .
Sony 's combined entertainment revenues rose 5.3 % in the quarter , while operating profit rose 4.7 % to 4.32 billion yen .
Those figures suggest to some analysts that Sony 's movie business could use a good housecleaning .
Chief among the complaints : Sony is spending too much for too few hit movies .
While Sony so far appears likely to avoid repeating the debacle of `` The Last Action Hero , '' a hugely expensive film that flopped resoundingly , analysts say Sony needs more good movies .
Sony officials , however , maintain they are n't concerned by what they consider a downturn in the cyclical entertainment business .
They point to hits such as `` Philadelphia , '' which Sony says grossed nearly $ 200 million in cumulative world-wide box office receipts .
Additionally , they insist they do n't plan any changes in their Hollywood management , and deny persistent rumors that Sony wants to sell off its studios to cut its losses .
`` We do n't care about the short-term ups and downs '' of the movie business , said Sumio Sano , Sony 's director of corporate affairs .
`` We believe in the value of the software business in the long term .
'' Other Sony officials are clearly concerned about high costs in the movie business , although they 're reluctant to talk about imposing controls from above .
While Sony headquarters in Tokyo does review budgets from the movie operations , company officials wo n't say how detailed that review gets , or whether they ever overrule managers in the U.S. Sony has long been sensitive to charges that it wants to manage the movie business from Tokyo .
Harnischfeger Industries Inc. , in a move that will significantly bolster its mining-equipment operations , agreed to acquire Joy Technologies Inc. for about $ 391 million in stock .
The acquisition is expected to complement Harnischfeger 's current surface-mining equipment line , and position the Brookfield , Wis. , company for an expected increase in demand as the mining industry rebounds .
Under terms of the agreement , Joy holders would receive 0.5652 share of Harnischfeger common stock for each of their shares .
Harnischfeger shares slipped $ 1.25 to $ 22.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday .
At that price , the exhange ratio would provide Joy holders with stock valued at $ 12.49 a share .
Joy shares rose $ 2 , or 20 % , to $ 12 in Big Board trading .
Like its competitors , Pittsburgh-based Joy 's mining equipment business has for some time been pressed by soft cyclical demand exacerbated by last year 's big coal strikes .
The company also supplies air-pollution and ash-handling equipment for electric utilities and other industrial operations .
For its fiscal year ended Feb. 25 , net income was $ 8.9 million , or 28 cents a share , after $ 4.8 million in charges .
Revenue was $ 566 million .
Harnischfeger said the acquisition , which it expects to close by year end , will contribute to earnings for its fiscal year ending Oct. 31 , 1995 .
In addition to Harnischfeger 's current surface-mining equipment business , the company has interests in paper-making machinery and overhead material handling equipment .
`` Our existing mining company needed to grow globally and therefore we needed to acquire another company .
Joy was a perfect fit , '' said a company spokesman .
`` If a deal could be a win-win , this is it , '' said Wertheim Schroder analyst Mitchell Quain , who covers both companies .
`` For Harnischfeger it will be an especially good deal '' because Joy has more market share , higher earnings and generates more cash , he said .
The transaction , which the companies intend to account for as a pooling of interests , is subject to the approval of both companies ' shareholders , as well as regulatory clearance .
MAXTOR Corp. -LRB- San Jose , Calif. -RRB- -- J. Larry Smart , 46 years old , chief operating officer , has been named chief executive , president and a director at this disk-drive maker .
He succeeds Laurence R. Hootnick , 52 , who resigned .
A successor for the chief operating officer post has n't been named .
DALLAS -- Indresco Inc. said its board authorized the buy back of as many as two million common shares .
Indresco , a supplier of equipment for the mining and construction industries , said it will make the purchases from time to time in the open market .
The company was authorized in 1993 to repurchase as many as 4.1 million shares , of which about 275,000 shares remain to be purchased .
NEW YORK -- Woolworth Corp. reported a $ 42 million loss in its fiscal second quarter , widening more than four times over its loss of $ 10 million in the same period last year .
Sales totaled $ 1.88 billion in the quarter ended July 30 , down 18 % from $ 2.29 billion a year earlier .
Per-share losses were 32 cents in the latest second quarter , compared with eight cents a year earlier .
Woolworth took an after-tax charge of $ 30 million related to the sale of 122 Canadian Woolco stores to Wal-Mart Inc. and the closing of 20 more .
The charge is the second one Woolworth has taken for the disposal of the Woolco operations .
Woolworth took a pretax charge of $ 168 million in the fourth quarter last year related to the Canadian transaction , surprising analysts who had expected a far smaller charge .
The latest charge surprised some of them again .
`` I do n't think many of us have ever seen anything like that , '' said Janet Mangano , an analyst with Burnham Securities Inc. , New York .
A Woolworth spokeswoman said the $ 30 million charge related partly to the valuation of assets and leases sold to Wal-Mart , adding that the company does n't anticipate further charges related to the Woolco sale and closings at this point .
Excluding the $ 30 million charge , North American operating income was $ 41 million , compared with $ 5 million in the year-ago quarter , Woolworth said .
The company also reported an $ 8 million gain on the sale of securities in Germany in the latest quarter ; including the gain , the company had an operating loss of $ 17 million in Germany .
The company said the revenue decline was largely attributable to the closing of about 970 stores in the U.S. and Canada and the disposal of the Canadian Woolco operations .
Excluding sales from the discontinued stores , revenues increased 4.1 % in the quarter , the company said .
Selling , general and administrative expenses declined 17 % , the company said , while interest expenses increased 42 % .
Quarterly figures for 1993 were restated , as previously reported , to correct gross margins and certain selling , general and administrative expenses .
SPRINGDALE , Ark. -- Chicken processor Tyson Foods Inc. acquired a 50 % interest in Cobb-Vantress Inc. from Upjohn Co. , bringing its stake to 100 % .

WASHINGTON -- As the National Rifle Association was losing its fight against the anticrime legislation passed by the House last night , it also lost one of its most influential board members .
During debate on the crime bill , which contains an NRA-opposed ban on semiautomatic assault weapons , Rep. John Dingell released a letter announcing his resignation from the NRA board .
The Michigan Democrat was first elected to the House in 1955 and , as the chairman of the far-reaching Energy and Commerce Committee for 13 years , is one of the most powerful members of Congress .
`` After a great deal of thought , I deeply regret that I find that the conflict between my responsibilities as a member of Congress and my duties as a board member of the National Rifle Association is irreconcilable , '' the letter said .
President Clinton and other Democrats have angrily blamed NRA lobbying for blocking an earlier anticrime measure .
Generally an opponent of gun-control measures , Mr. Dingell voted in favor of the wide-ranging crime bill .
VIENNA , Va. -- America Online Inc. said it concluded its acquisition of Redgate Communications Corp. .
America Online said the acquisition was approved by federal regulators and Redgate shareholders .
Under the terms of the deal , Redgate , a multimedia marketing firm , becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of the on-line computer service .
In May , America Online offered 548,000 shares , valued at $ 35 million , to Redgate shareholders .
Redgate , based in Vero Beach , Fla. , produces interactive retail catalogues on CD-ROM and will help America Online create advertisements online .
It will also help the service move from a simple interface that uses icons to one which involves more pictures and sound .
The Pentagon will reconsider the future of several huge military-aircraft contracts and other programs , an unexpected shift that could hurt Boeing Co. , Lockheed Corp. and some other contractors .
The Defense Department , which until now has stood firmly behind funding for programs such as the Air Force 's $ 71.6 billion F-22 fighter and the Army 's $ 2.1 billion Comanche helicopter , will actively consider delaying or canceling a number of the contracts beginning in September , according to a memorandum issued late last week by John M. Deutch , deputy defense secretary and the Pentagon 's acquisition chief .
Many in Congress have urged the Pentagon to reconsider its needs in light of defense-budget shortfalls that could top $ 80 billion over the next five years .
Still , Mr. Deutch 's new determination to explore the potential cuts surprised some officials at the affected companies and their congressional representatives .
In the memorandum to members of the Defense Resources Board policy council , Mr. Deutch instructed the Air Force to immediately drum up an alternative `` that delays the initial procurement of F-22 fighters by up to four years .
'' Lockheed holds two-thirds of the contracts for the next-generation F-22 air-superiority fighter , while Boeing holds the other one-third .
The F-22 , the largest planned U.S. procurement for a single weapons system , has been assailed by critics who doubt the need for the plane given the reduced threat from the former Soviet Union .
In advance of the policy board 's September session , the Army has been ordered to produce an option that would allow `` termination '' of the Comanche , or RAH-66 , a light scout\/attack helicopter being developed jointly by Boeing and the Sikorsky unit of United Technologies Corp. .
Mr. Deutch 's memorandum also calls for the Navy and Marines to offer `` the most promising alternative that cancels '' the $ 2.6 billion contract for the V-22 Osprey , a two-engine aircraft that can fly like a plane but land like helicopter , which is being developed jointly by Boeing and the Bell helicopters unit of Textron Inc. .
Other options to be considered include cuts or cancellation in development of advanced training jets , ships and submarines , and the advanced Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile being developed by Northrop Grumman Corp. .
A spokesman for Mr. Deutch would n't confirm the existence of the memorandum .
But he said such a missive would aim `` to set the agenda '' for each item to be discussed at a board meeting and `` that does n't mean it is going to happen .
'' `` Obviously , we 're concerned , but we 're not alarmed , '' said a spokesman for Lockheed , based in Calabasas , Calif. .
The spokesman said officials at the company 's Georgia military-aircraft operations are aware of reports that Mr. Deutch now wants to examine an F-22 delay .
He said the move is `` just part of the normal budget process , '' although `` it 's certainly something we 're going to pay attention to .
'' A spokesman for Seattle-based Boeing acknowleged that executives there are aware of the memorandum , but said they `` do n't know what it means '' and are studying the implications .
The new openness to sharp cuts in procurement fits with Defense Secretary William Perry 's emerging priorities , which tend to put a premium on readiness and research over other budgetary demands .
Some in Congress nonetheless were worried by the broad range of cuts to be examined .
`` These are some big programs , '' said one congressional staffer close to defense matters , and there could be a severe potential impact on future employment among companies in some districts .
Industry and congressional onlookers speculated that only selected cuts ultimately will be enacted .
Of all the possible cuts , a stretch in F-22 production would be among the most controversial .
The fighter 's critics , including those in the General Accounting Office , have suggested a seven-year delay is acceptable in production of a now-planned 442 of the jets by the year 2011 .
For now , development of the jet is proceeding under contracts that call for $ 2.46 billion in fiscal 1995 funding .
Production is scheduled to begin with an award in 1998 for the first four jets .
The program employs 2,200 Lockheed workers in Texas and Georgia , plus about 2,200 employees of Boeing and the Pratt & Whitney engine unit of United Technologies .

CARACAS , Venezuela -- Representatives of the state-owned oil company , Petroleos de Venezuela , outlined their plan to open up the nation 's high-quality oil fields to joint ventures with foreign investors .
Until now , foreign consortiums have had limited access to the nationalized Venezuelan oil industry , with investments restricted to joint ventures in marginal fields , natural gas and extra-heavy crude .
But Pdvsa , as the oil company is known , announced at a news conference Friday that it has put together a plan on a profit-sharing basis that could see the first contracts awarded as early as March of next year .
Contracts will be awarded to foreign companies or consortiums that are willing to give the largest percentage of their profits to the state through a state Profits Participation Tax , known by its Spanish acronym PEG .
Once a company earns a contract , it will be allowed to begin exploration .
The foreign company will assume all risk and all possible losses if no oil is found .
Once a discovery is made , a Pdvsa subsidiary will have an option to enter the joint venture with as much as a 35 % stake in the company .
Initial profits will be used to pay off the foreign company 's initial investment .
After the investment is returned , however , the profits will be subject to a host of steep taxes that will in some cases amount to more than 90 % of total profits .
First , whatever percentage of profits the company agreed to give the state through its PEG bid will immediately be deducted from its gross profits .
The state will also take out a 16.7 % royalties tax .
Then , the company 's remaining profits will be subject to the same 67.7 % tax that Pdvsa is currently taxed at .
Of the remainder , the Pdvsa affiliate is entitled to its percentage , up to 35 % .
The remaining profits are the company 's .
To understand how the scheme works , consider a company that makes a $ 100 million profit after recouping its initial investment -- a PEG of 50 % , the maximum allowed .
First the state would take out its $ 50 million PEG fee , plus $ 16.7 million in royalties taxes , leaving the company with $ 33.3 million .
The state would then take out 67.7 % of the remaining profits , leaving the company with $ 11.1 million .
However , depending on the quality of the field , a Pdvsa subsidiary could have joined the project with as much as a 35 % stake , in which case the subsidiary is entitled to take out 35 % of the final profits , leaving the foreign company with just $ 7.2 million for every $ 100 million in profits .
If no PEG was charged to the company , the state would still retain $ 84.4 million of the $ 100 million in profits .
The Pdvsa affiliate could then take up to 35 % of the remainder .
Pdvsa presidential adviser Ronald Pantin said the company hopes to get congressional approval of the plan by the end of September , and receive formal requests from companies to be considered sometime in October .
Mr. Pantin said in an interview with local financial daily Economia Hoy that some companies have already expressed interest in pursuing the high-quality field contracts , such as Shell Oil , Exxon Corp. , Chevron Corp. , Atlantic Richfield Co. , Amoco Corp. , Mobil Corp. , Texaco Inc. , Occidental , Home Oil International , Hung , Recope , Repsol , Itochu , Ranger Oil Ltd. and Pennzoil .
Interested companies must pay Pdvsa a fee of $ 50,000 per site for a Pdvsa data package on a field , then an additional $ 100,000 fee to enter bids .
Although Mr. Pantin acknowledged that the costs , including the 85 % or greater tax outlays , were large , he argued that Pdvsa 's research showed that the risk of investment in the Venezuelan fields compared favorably to investment opportunities in the United Kingdom , Ecuador , Colombia and Indonesia , and the comparison becomes particularly favorable to Venezuela the larger the field .
Under pressure from the financial industry , Russian officials appear to be reconsidering proposals for heavy-handed government regulation of securities trading in favor of letting brokers do more self-policing .
Anxious to calm public fears after the collapse of the giant MMM investment fund last month , the Finance Ministry has been considering a new law that would give Russian tax authorities broad powers to intervene in the financial markets .
Originally , the ministry was planning to announce details of that law as early as this week .
But the top financial houses joined forces and apparently have convinced the authorities to delay any action until the needs of law-abiding market participants can be more carefully considered .
According to people close to negotiations that were under way Friday in Moscow , a new group called the Professional Association of Participants in the Securities Market was proposing a code of conduct that would be largely self-enforced .
The code would set rules for how security dealers could market their services and advertise new investments .
The code also would require warnings about potential risks and establish other standards of `` good practice .
'' Self-regulation could eliminate the need for more draconian measures by the government , market participants argued .
The Russian Securities and Exchange Commission , as well as some progressive Russian government officials , also argued that intervention that is too heavy-handed could be devastating for the budding financial and privatization business here .
The Finance Ministry had been considering creating a special branch of tax police with broad powers to intervene in the markets .
The law would have mandated other changes in the securities business , such as forcing all trades to take place inside stock exchanges .
Currently , most trades are handled among brokers by phone , but a computerized over-the-counter trading system is being set up that could also help prevent abuses .
Several securities dealers predicted that some sort of law still would come into force later this year , but they were hopeful that some of the measures harmful to their business could be avoided .
`` I do n't think it 's a mistake to have a more regulated market , '' says Ruben Vardanian , executive director of Troika Dialogue , an investment banking and financial consulting firm in Moscow .
`` In fact , I think it 's needed .
'' The government promised to take action after the MMM investment fund was unable to repay investors who tried to sell their shares .
Russian authorities think the fund , which promised huge returns to investors , owned no assets but simply repaid sellers with the cash provided by new investors .
MMM 's president , Sergei Mavrodi , is in jail on charges of tax evasion and obstructing an official investigation .
On Friday , he ordered MMM sales offices across the country to reopen and resume share sales .
Some Russians made a fortune trading in MMM shares , and many of the country 's citizens blame the government for the fund 's problems .
Despite Russia 's failure so far to rein in MMM 's activities , investment professionals said it would be a mistake to write laws for the whole financial industry based on the MMM episode .
While MMM claimed to have five million investors , one investment banker said the fund 's impact was tiny compared to the business now being handled by serious , professional brokers .
`` The legitimate industry is experiencing turnover of $ 500 million or $ 600 million a month , '' he said .
`` It would be a big mistake to ruin such a promising industry .
'' RIO DE JANEIRO -- The continued success of Brazil 's latest anti-inflation program depends heavily on whether working people such as Jose Geraldo Ribeiro can resist the temptation to splurge with the country 's new currency , the real .
On a recent afternoon , Mr. Ribeiro stood outside a store window pondering the purchase of a radio he 'd wanted for some time .
`` I 'm thinking of buying now because you seem to get more with this money , '' he says , holding up a newly minted one-real coin .
Indeed , the breathtaking decline in inflation following the July introduction of the real has effectively put an extra $ 2 billion each month in the pockets of Brazilian laborers , who had grown used to seeing inflation devour their earnings .
Even though a tiny portion of that windfall found its way to Mr. Ribeiro , he resisted the temptation to buy the radio .
Brazil 's government is hoping that many others emulate his restraint .
A sudden explosion in consumer demand could put pressure on wages and prices , throwing the carefully designed anti-inflation program out of kilter .
Such consumption binges contributed heavily to the failure of a half-dozen previous Brazilian anti-inflation programs that started just as promisingly as this one .
For that reason , Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero has been appearing almost daily on radio and television exhorting Brazilians to spend frugally .
`` Only buy the essentials , '' he said recently .
`` Prices can fall even further .
'' In the near term , the risk of a consumption boom looms large over a plan whose early success has surprised even the government economists who designed it .
Inflation is expected to be about 2 % this month compared with 50 % in June .
Along with benefiting workers , the anti-inflation offensive has aided Fernando Henrique Cardoso , the centrist presidential candidate who crafted the strategy in his previous post as finance minister .
A national poll released over the weekend gave Mr. Cardoso a 13 percentage point lead over his leftist rival , Luis Inacio Lula da Silva .
It was the first poll to show Mr. Cardoso with a sufficient advantage to win the election outright in October 's first round of voting .
Only a couple of months ago , before the start-up of the plan , Mr. da Silva enjoyed a lead of 20 percentage points .
Critics have had little ammunition to use against the new program .
There has been no flight of investors away from the real to the safety of the dollar .
On the contrary , an inflow of foreign capital to the local stock market has boosted Brazil 's hard currency reserves to $ 35 billion and sent the dollar tumbling to its weakest level against a Brazilian currency in nearly 30 years .
In an even bigger boon to the real , the erratic President Itamar Franco has reined in his populist tendencies .
After criticizing his economic team for being too stingy in wage negotiations with the military , Mr. Franco this month finally acceded to an increase that fell within the budget guidelines .
`` Up to now Mr. Franco has done no irreparable harm , '' Mr. Cardoso said , in a moment of candor .
In past economic plans , Brazilians had no confidence that early reductions in inflation could be sustained .
So they spent their money as fast as they could , hoping to obtain some tangible benefit before inflation returned .
It inevitably did , if only as a self-fulfilling prophecy .
It 's clear that introduction of the real has also triggered a pickup in consumption , fueled in part by an increase in consumer credit .
Auto dealers enjoyed the best July in their history .
The number of calls by merchants to the Credit Protection Service , a key indicator of retail activity , was 35 % higher in the first week of August than in the same period last year , according to the Sao Paulo Merchants Association .
Consumer-electronics makers report double-digit sales gains since the introduction of the real .
`` In Sao Paulo today , it 's difficult to find a television to buy or to sell , '' says Aldo Astolfi , director of marketing for Makro Atacadista , a wholesale supermarket chain whose August sales are running 15 % ahead of projections .
Still Mr. Astolfi thinks the sales surge is controlled enough to be healthy .
`` What we 're seeing with the real is a significant but sustainable increase in the purchasing power of working Brazilians , '' he says .
`` What happened with the earlier plans was a rush of people running to stores to buy anything they could .
A panic .
'' For now , economists see signs that consumption wo n't stoke inflation .
Industry is running at only about 75 % of capacity , an indication that factories still have room to increase production before pressure on wages and prices tightens .
`` It 's important to take into account that both producers and consumers have been enduring pain for more than a decade now , '' says Daniel Coradi , president of Financial Engineers & Consultants , an economic consulting firm .
`` I 'm actually on the side of having the government lower interest rates and allow consumption to grow at a somewhat faster pace .
'' Mr. Ricupero wo n't hear of that .
Besides keeping interest rates high , the finance minister continues what he calls `` an almost religious cry '' in favor of thrift .
Last week , he even told Brazilians to cut back on purchases for Brazilian Father 's Day .
The best gift for dad would be lower inflation , he said .
ST. LOUIS -- Trans World Airlines said it reached a tentative agreement with its largest labor union over new work-rule and productivity changes , the first step in a plan to revive the airline .
TWA and the Machinists union 's Lodge 142 agreed to `` soft-dollar '' concessions to enhance productivity , ending three weeks of negotiations .
The airline would n't disclose specifics of the agreements , which cover mechanics and dining and passenger service employees .
But it did say the plan does n't call for wage reductions of any kind .
The agreements are subject to ratification by Machinists union members at their meeting set to begin on Thursday .
`` These agreements provide for the necessary productivity changes to ensure the long-term survival of TWA , '' said William O'Driscoll , union president and general chairman .
The Machinists union represents about 13,800 of TWA 's 24,500 employees .
TWA , the nation 's seventh-largest airline , has been unable to regain its financial footing since it emerged from bankruptcy court last November .
As a result , lowering labor costs has become a priority .
The airline is still in negotiations with its two other unions over productivity improvements .
A company spokesman said he expects agreements to surface from those talks by the end of the month .
The airline estimates its revenue is running short of its 1994 plan , and it has been experimenting with various cost-cutting measures to make up for the shortfall .
Last month , TWA announced plans to lay off 3,000 of its employees .
It is currently working on a `` re-engineering '' effort that includes a change of management , workrule agreements and a financial restructuring of the airline .
WASHINGTON -- The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to exempt retail-sales personnel from a rule aimed at preventing bond dealers from making political contributions to state and local officials in return for business .
The proposed change seeks to alleviate confusion in the dealer community , and should n't open a loophole in the rule , board officials said .
MSRB Chairman David Clapp , of Goldman , Sachs & Co. , said in a recent interview that registered sales representatives never were part of the so-called `` pay-to-play '' problem .
He said any attempt by dealers to use these people to funnel money to politicans to win business would be covered by the part of the rule barring dealers from doing indirectly what they ca n't do directly .
The board promised to reconsider the matter if it learns of retail-sales people making contributions to influence the awarding of muni business .
The basic rule bars muni dealers from doing business with a jurisdiction within two years of making a political contribution to an official of the jurisdiction .
It took effect April 25 , and Mr. Clapp said `` a huge monster percentage of the money has dried up .
'' The MSRB , a self-regulatory body subject to SEC oversight , also asked the commission to amend the rule to require muni dealers to record and disclose `` all payments '' made to political parties , with payment defined as `` any gift , subscription , loan , advance or deposit of money or anything of value .
'' This proposed change would expand a prior reporting standard from covering just `` contributions '' to political parties to covering all payments .
Christopher Taylor , MSRB executive director , cited reports that some state political parties were soliciting funds for things other than political contributions , such as administrative expenses .
He said the proposed rule change is designed to assure that people do n't try to use semantics to avoid record-keeping and disclosure requirements .
It 's true that `` My So-Called Life , '' the season 's new hour-long drama beginning Thursday -LRB- ABC , 8 p.m. EDT -RRB- comes trailing heavy advance publicity and news of critical acclaim .
Still , this should n't discourage anyone from tuning in .
The new show , by producers Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz , deals with the lives and tribulations of 15 - and 16-year-olds -- and it promises to be easier on the nerves than the team 's earlier hit , `` thirtysomething , '' which was concerned with characters in a far more advanced state of adolescence .
Further , and contrary to the publicity about the new show 's alleged disturbing and dark quality , its portrait of teen America is so innocent it may conceivably jar a public that has come to believe -- along with Surgeon General Elders and all the progressive educators hawking condoms in school cafeterias -- in a young America busy , from age 12 on , copulating round the clock .
In , for instance , the tough high-school world of `` My So-Called Life '' -- complete with a tormented resident bisexual -- sex is still such a huge deal that the mere rumor that a student has had , as someone puts it , `` the complete act '' is enough to throw the entire school population into a frenzy of excitement .
This is the new '90s generation ?
-LRB- Not exactly perhaps , but this picture of it may be closer to the truth than the aforementioned one .
-RRB- A gun brought into school by somebody 's relative accidentally goes off , sending a bullet through somebody 's locker .
The gun incident , which results in the destruction of a bottle of soda , sets off a scandal of such magnitude in this school population of knowing young punks that no one talks about anything else .
In turn it also consumes the attention of administrators , detectives and police for weeks on end .
This could be -- with some costume changes -- an American high school in the '50s .
Except , that is , for the psychological counselor , that up-to-date presence nowadays rushed into schools when untoward events take place to lead grief assemblies .
It is a nice scene here that captures the flavor of this earnest enterprise , wherein the counselor listens with bottomless compassion as students -- enjoying this reprieve from the humdrum of classrooms -- obligingly squeeze out symptoms of trauma .
There is , of course , plenty in the show to bring home the fact that this is television of the '90s and not the '50s -- notably the character of the father , Graham -LRB- Tom Irwin -RRB- , a self-satisfied twit reeking of a very contemporary sort of glibness .
Whether Mr. Irwin or the producers intended it , this is a father and husband who makes the blood run cold in a fresh sort of way .
Watching him is certainly better , anyway , than watching his counterparts in the current run of prime-time dramas , most of whose creators ca n't seem to imagine a way to portray fathers other than as predators or oafs .
Everyone knew that Fox 's `` Melrose Place '' had run out of steam , not to say pride , when its writers were reduced to inventing a scenario revealing that the show 's lovely and good heroine , Alison , had been molested sexually as a child by her very own successful -LRB- what else ?
-RRB- and charming father -- a fact that she had -LRB- what else ?
-RRB- completely repressed for 25 years or so .
Both the father and the mother of the young heroine here -LRB- ably played by Claire Danes -RRB- run a household bearing small resemblance to the flinty blue-collar sort now everywhere on the screen .
These parents , including the mother , portrayed by the disarming Bess Armstrong , have gone to college .
There are , in short , no Roseannes here , but the show does have a way of homing in on matters like social class every now and then .
The mother here is the kind of woman who can be horrified at the loudmouthed tramp her daughter has taken to running with and be at the same time smitten by the style of the tramp 's no less loudmouthed mother -- the sort of scene Ms. Armstrong carries off admirably .
One way and another all of this hangs together , with writing that runs from adequate to smart .
One of the better conversations takes place in the school bathroom -- setting for a considerable number of crisis scenes -- where girls ponder such questions as , `` What 's the difference between fat-free and nonfat ?
'' Would that anyone could tell them .
A more dramatic encounter in the girls ' bathroom has the heroine , Angela , in turmoil over her ruptured relationship with her longtime friend , Sharon -LRB- Devon Odessa -RRB- , whom Angela has dropped in favor of a new pal .
This scene 's effectiveness in capturing the awful bitterness of girlfriend jealousies owes a lot to Ms. Odessa , already a master hand at projecting pain in the grand manner .
This is clear not only in the bathroom scene but the ones in the cafeteria , the music room and everywhere else Sharon ponders her other plight -- if such it is -- namely that of a girl who is owner of the biggest breasts in the sophomore class .
A core of sugariness lies not very far beneath the surface jangle and rages of the lives here , one that Messrs. Zwick and Herskovitz & Co. manage to keep under control .
What is not under control is the first overstuffed and overobvious episode , which does n't deliver nearly as strong a sense of the show 's real poise as the subsequent ones .
On the other hand , it does provide the introduction to characters like Brian , played by Devon -LRB- another one -RRB- Gummersall , who has a presence -- and face -- that is a pleasure to behold .
Moreover , the producers have done everyone a favor with the creation of Brian , one of the rare scholarly achievers among students on prime time who is n't a spindly eccentric with allergies .
On the other hand , happy he is not , though he is clearly cheerier than the muscularly handsome idiot years behind in class assignments , trying to fathom Kafka -- and who wants to know if this case of the man turned into a cockroach is a made-up story .
It 's nice to watch the way Mr. Gummersall 's face goes coldly blank at the question -- and nicer yet to imagine that they are still teaching Kafka in the schools .
Iced-tea makers may have conquered America , but they 're finding tea-loving Britain a tough sell .
`` It was bloody awful , '' says London construction worker Eddie Cass , after sampling a new canned iced tea he had seen advertised .
Adds co-worker Mick Berry : `` It tasted like stewed tea that had been left in the pot .
'' Such are the challenges faced by iced-tea makers in Britain -- a culture where tea , served hot , is the national drink and cold tea borders on the sacrilegious .
Iced tea , after all , is a quintessentially American beverage , and U.S. consumers last year downed more than 332.7 million gallons of the stuff , not including homebrewed .
Europeans , meanwhile , drank about half that amount and most of it was consumed in Italy and Switzerland , where hot tea is n't as popular .
The rest of Europe has proved much harder to convince .
`` I ca n't yet see it being an everyday shopping item at the supermarket , '' says Tim Potter , a food analyst with Smith New Court PLC. `` Given the generally conservative taste of the average British consumer , it may be a bit difficult to convince them to drink something in iced form that they 've been drinking for centuries in hot form .
'' Nevertheless , companies that have made a splash with iced teas in the U.S. , Unilever Group and Snapple Beverage Corp. , believe they can eventually convince the British that iced tea is n't just hot tea that 's gotten cold , but a plausible alternative to soft drinks .
Earlier this year , a partnership of Unilever 's Brooke Bond Foods Ltd. and PepsiCo Inc. , introduced Liptonice in the United Kingdom with a $ 9 million advertising campaign that features iced-tea drinkers amid lemon groves and splashing waves .
Striking at the heart of British tradition , the company brazenly passed out free samples at the Wimbledon tennis championships this summer and has hired British comedy actor Angus Deayton to tout the drink .
The slogan : `` Made with tea , surprisingly .
'' Because the goal is to distinguish iced tea from cold dregs left in the pot , the makers of Liptonice have gone a step further , in a move that might make American iced-tea fans cringe : Liptonice is carbonated .
The company says the fizzy tea fared better than traditional versions in consumer taste tests it has been conducting in the U.K. since 1989 .
`` We ` ve tried to bring people around to the idea of looking at tea in a different way , '' says Brooke Bond spokeswoman Helen Park .
`` This is a product you love and enjoy as a hot drink , but it 's also excellent in a different way .
'' Plenty of consumers disagree .
The barrage of Liptonice commercials made 26-year-old Winston Hurd curious enough to try the drink ... once .
`` Let 's say it was -- unusual , '' says Mr. Hurd , a delivery driver .
`` I 've never quite tasted anything like it actually .
I 'll stick with Coke .
'' Although Brooke Bond wo n't release sales data , the company says it will sell 4.3 million gallons of Liptonice and Liptonice Light in Britain by year 's end .
However , according to market researcher AGB Impulse , volume sales of Liptonice reached only 118,000 gallons for the four weeks ended June 5 .
At that pace , Liptonice sales would total only 1.2 million gallons by the end of the year .
Liptonice actually marks the second time Unilever has gambled on the British iced-tea market .
In 1989 , the company test-marketed an iced tea called Coolbrew , in both carbonated and traditional versions , but never launched it nationally .
`` It flopped , '' says Patrick Fisher , a research analyst with Zenith International Ltd. , a U.K.-based market-research firm .
The company says it simply made a `` commercial choice '' to spend its money on other products rather than a national launch of Coolbrew .
The product itself , was n't the problem , the company says ; it was just ahead of its time .
Now , hopeful marketers point to the growth of such beverages as carbonated flavored water as an indication that consumers in the U.K. are increasingly receptive to new types of beverages .
`` There is a need for a product for adults , '' says Brooke Bonds ' Ms. Park .
`` And tea is very very important .
It 's a very big drink in this country .
'' Meanwhile , Snapple , which leads the U.S. ready-to-drink tea market , is hoping to ease Bristish consumers into drinking iced tea by enticing them to sample other Snapple products .
The company has been selling noncarbonated fruit drinks in Britain , including lemonade , as well as iced teas flavored with raspberry , peach and orange , for about one year .
In addition to Britain , Ireland and Norway , Snapple has just launched its product line in Sweden and Denmark , and is test marketing in France and Spain .
`` They may try the fruit drinks first , '' says Mario Soussou , Snapple vice president of international sales .
`` Once they 've established it 's a good-tasting product , they may get more adventurous with the other flavors .
'' Snapple 's advertising campaign in Britain is similar to the way the product is promoted in the U.S. -- folksy television spots featuring real people , not actors , from news agents and fish-and-chips shops that sell Snapple .
But the gentle humor of the Snapple ads is lost on some Britons .
When 27-year-old office manager Mari Jude first saw the ads , she thought they were a hoax .
And the campaign has yet to persuade her to even try iced tea .
`` It just does n't appeal to me , '' says Ms. Jude .
`` For a while I did n't quite believe the advert .
I thought it was somebody 's home video .
'' But the third member of the big iced-tea triumverate in the U.S. , a joint venture between Coca-Cola Co. and Nestle SA that markets the Nestea brand , is noticeably absent in Britain .
The company has recently launched its product in nine European countries but is still mulling the U.K. market .
`` Unlike the U.S. , there has n't been a history of consumption of iced tea in Europe , '' says European general manager Tom Trimble .
`` The big problem is changing consumer perceptions .
It 's going to be a long job .
'' NEW YORK -- May Department Stores Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. reached a $ 28 million settlement with bondholders over a controversial bond-refinancing tactic .
Known as the `` simultaneous tender offer and cash call , '' or Stac , the tactic was used by the two companies to call away roughly $ 250 million in high-yielding May bonds from investors when interest rates were still falling in 1992 .
The bonds were nonrefundable , meaning they could n't be refinanced with a new issue of lower-yielding bonds .
But they were cash-callable , meaning they could be repaid early out of funds generated by profits or the sale of assets or stock .
The lawsuit alleged that May improperly used the threat of a cash call to induce bondholders to sell their bonds back to the company at only a modest premium , in a refinancing funded by the proceeds of a new bond issue .
Officials at St. Louis-based May and its investment banker Morgan Stanley , a unit of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. , confirmed that the lawsuit was settled , but would n't confirm the $ 28 million payout amount , which was provided by two representatives of the bondholders .
The settlement came just before the bondholder civil lawsuit against May and Morgan Stanley was scheduled to go to trial today in the state circuit court in Montgomery , Ala. .
It originally was filed in December 1992 .
The settlement could encourage investors in the bonds of other companies to take legal action .
The Stac method has been used to call away up to $ 2 billion of other bonds , estimates Michael Rediker , an attorney for the bondholders in the suit .
Other firms , notably Goldman , Sachs & Co. and Merrill Lynch & Co. have underwritten Stac-type deals .
Among the borrowers involved were Mercantile Stores Co. , Houston Industries Inc. and James River Corp. .
The lawsuit `` sent the message to Wall Street that bondholders are willing to oppose tactics like this , '' said Thomas G. Milne , director of fixed income at Alabama 's retirement system .
Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Tracy Gordon said , `` We settled because there is always uncertainty in a jury trial , particularly one dealing with complicated financial issues .
We still feel that the transaction was a fair and legitimate means of retiring high-cost callable debt .
'' Jim Abrams , vice president of corporate communications at May , said the company was `` glad all the parties were able to agree on a compromise to avoid further cost and litigation risk .
'' He said that May is still using Morgan Stanley as an investment banker .
The suit alleged that Morgan Stanley and May committed a `` breach of indenture '' that was `` improper and coercive '' when they used a $ 200 million bond issue in the fall of 1992 , as interest rates were falling , to pay off some nonrefundable but cash-callable high-interest bonds , causing the bondholders to lose $ 24 million in potential 1988-to-1992 earnings .
Most of the other bondholders in the suit were institutional investors , including the California Public Employees Retirement System , John Hancock Sovereign Bond Fund , the Washington State Investments Board , the State of Montana Board of Investments and Erie Family Life Insurance Co. .
The suit sought $ 24 million of compensatory and $ 100 million of punitive damages .
According to Mr. Rediker , the settlement allows each bondholder to receive part of the $ 28 million cash payment , or special issues of noncallable notes , which would mature in 2000 and yield either 10 3\/4 % or 10 7\/8 % depending on what each bondholder originally owned .
TEL AVIV -- The Tel Aviv stock exchange plummeted nearly 10 % after reopening yesterday , as the Israeli government , in an apparent effort to stem the plunge , announced it would modify a new capital-gains tax .
The market had been closed since Tuesday , when the government unveiled a package of economic reforms designed to fight inflation , including a 10 % capital-gains tax scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 1 if approved by the Israeli Parliament .
The new tax surprised Israeli investors because it came only a few months after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin pledged he would n't support taxing stockmarket profits .
In trading yesterday , the General Share Index , which opened the day at 183.39 , fell almost 10 % , closing at 165.25 .
Public pressure surrounding the new tax caused the government to backpedal over the weekend from its initial proposal , which did n't provide for market losses to be offset against any gains .
Economists had criticized the plan , saying an investor with a varied portfolio could suffer overall losses but still be required to pay the tax on individual stocks that gained .
The new amendment allows investors the option of choosing an alternative system that would tax only net gains , but at a higher rate , estimated at between 15-20 % .
Though yesterday 's steep fall was unprecedented and the mood at the exchange was generally gloomy , the conclusion by many Israeli analysts was that things could have been worse .
`` Some predictions were for a 30 % drop , '' said David Rosenberg , an analyst at Pacific Mediterranean Investments in Herzelia Pituach .
`` People seem to be acting fairly rationally .
The cooling-off period definitely helped .
'' The opposition Likud Party organized a demonstration outside the exchange , arguing the change will hit the middle class hardest because someone who invests 2,000 shekels and someone who invests two million both pay the same tax rate .
The exchange , which had allowed unlimited price drops in yesterday 's trading , returns today to the normal 10 % limit on rises or declines .
One of RailTex Inc. 's directors is Heather Gradison , who , as chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1985-90 , led the drive to let nonrailroad companies buy short lines without costly labor-contract buyouts .
Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont calls her position outrageous .
`` That the woman most responsible for the growth of RailTex should leave government and collect money from RailTex is why tens of millions of Americans are disgusted with government , '' he says .
Mrs. Gradison says that for her first three years as a director , she was paid less than $ 2,000 a year .
That will rise to $ 15,000 now that RailTex has gone public , she adds .
`` It 's not as though I 'm being paid off , '' she says .
`` To the contrary , there are many more remunerative things I could do in rail transportation , '' she says .
NEWARK , N.J. -- First Fidelity Bancorp. said it completed acquisition of First Inter-Bancorp Inc. , Fishkill , N.Y. , and its subsidiary Mid-Hudson Savings Bank for $ 56 million .
LONDON -- Britain 's merchandise trade deficit with countries outside the European Union widened to a seasonally adjusted # 418 million -LRB- $ 647.8 million -RRB- in July from a revised # 392 million in June , the Central Statistical Office said .
The shortfall is narrower than the consensus among economists for a gap of # 600 million .
Adam Opel AG said in Frankfurt that it wants to add 12 Saturday shifts to its production schedule for the remainder of this year to increase output of the company 's revamped line of Omega luxury cars .
Opel , the big German operating arm of General Motors Corp. , is also in talks with its employee works council over the introduction of `` temporary limited night shifts '' to help meet buoyant demand .
WASHINGTON -- Health-care reform hangs by a thread in Congress , as President Clinton is now reduced to trying to salvage a bill that at best lays the foundation for some day achieving his goal of medical coverage for all Americans .
These efforts now turn on a plan put forward by a bipartisan bloc of Senate moderates , who propose a progressive set of insurance-market reforms with a much-scaled-back subsidy program for poor and working-class families .
Proponents say the so-called `` mainstream coalition '' plan is the last , best chance for health-care reform this year .
But by putting more emphasis on deficit reduction than universal coverage , the plan would leave more than 20 million people without insurance at the turn of the century .
`` We 've tried to do the doable and leave the rest for next year , '' said Sen. David Durenberger -LRB- R. , Minn. -RRB- , a member of the coalition .
Even this progress is fragile , Mr. Durenberger warned , if the Senate recesses for the summer without agreeing on what to do .
`` You go home and health-care reform is dead , '' he said .
The health-care-reform debate has always come down to an ideological dual over whether market forces can cure the ills of high medical costs and inadequate coverage , or whether extensive government involvement is necessary to finance and deliver care equitably .
Virtually every other industrialized country has given up on the free market for medical care .
But despite a Democratic president and congressional leadership pushing for a greater government role , business-backed market advocates are prevailing .
Sen. John Chafee -LRB- R. , R.I. -RRB- , a leader of the moderate bloc and persistent optimist , is slated to meet today with Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine and other Senate Democrats .
But in trying to reach a compromise , he and Mr. Mitchell risk being undercut by competing camps on the left and right .
The elderly are protesting the proposed savings from Medicare in the moderates ' plan .
Labor unions and conservative antitax Republicans are working against a provision that would limit corporate deductions for higher-cost health plans .
The White House wants to give Mr. Mitchell wide leeway but still hopes for a deal that preserves a backup provision to require employers to help pay for their workers ' insurance if voluntary measures do n't sufficiently expand coverage .
The renewed emphasis on deficit reduction poses problems , too , for the House Democratic leadership after the emphasis on spending in the bloody crime-bill debate .
Preliminary estimates by the Congressional Budget Office indicate that revisions must be made in the House leadership 's ambitious health-care bill just to stay within the budget .
And without tougher controls to contain rising medical costs -- controls that are opposed by many of the same moderates who want deficit reduction -- Democrats would have to scuttle ancillary benefits they had promised supporters .
By their own admission , the Senate moderates ' $ 100 billion , 10-year deficit-reduction target is a seat-of-the-pants figure advanced in the final days by Democratic Sens. David Boren of Oklahoma and Robert Kerrey of Nebraska .
Achieving that reduction may have little to do with health reform itself .
Among the moderates , there was concern it would have an adverse impact on subsidies for higher-income states such as California , represented in the group by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein .
In fact , the new taxes in the plan -- about $ 120 billion to $ 130 billion over 10 years -- will be all but exhausted just meeting the deficit goal rather than paying subsidies .
Part of the revenues would pay for nearly $ 30 billion in expanded deductions for the self-employed and individuals buying health insurance .
But any subsidies to expand coverage for poor and working-class families must depend on savings from federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid .
Payments under Medicaid to hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of uninsured poor families would be cut , yielding a savings of between $ 110 billion to $ 120 billion .
And the plan assumes increased savings from Medicare of $ 260 billion -- or about $ 60 billion more than the net reductions proposed in a health-care plan approved by the Senate Finance Committee or a version put forward by Sen. Mitchell .
If market reforms turned out to yield more savings , the moderates would find it easier to meet their schedule of expanded subsidies .
But the tight budget leaves little room for such programs as a new prescription-drug benefit for the elderly or aid for academic-research centers .
`` I do n't know where the give is , '' Sen. Boren said .
`` There 's not much give .
That 's the answer .
'' The plan most resembles the bill approved by the Senate Finance panel last month .
That proposal , as calculated by the Congressional Budget Office , would offer $ 130 billion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years but would raise taxes much higher and reap savings by bringing Medicaid more fully into its subsidy scheme .
Precise numbers are n't available , but by their own calculations the moderates may have $ 100 billion less for subsidies than the Finance Committee bill , which would achieve only 92 % coverage by the turn of the century .
The same mainstream group in June had proposed to fully implement the subsidies by the year 2001 , phasing them out for families earning 240 % of the poverty level .
The revised plan would phase them out at double the poverty level and would n't be fully in place until 2004 .
For working-class families , the chief exception is a program aimed at providing insurance for children and pregnant women in families earning up to 240 % of the poverty level .
Moderates may yet decide to raise taxes more to fund this subsidy , which is both an important political symbol and an easy means to boost coverage , because children are cheaper to insure than adults .
The politics in the Senate may be best understood through two old warhorses , Minority Leader Robert Dole and Sen. Edward Kennedy , both of whom were in the chamber when Richard Nixon tried to enact health reform more than two decades ago .
Many of the GOP moderates are longstanding Dole allies , and Sen. Nancy Kassebaum , his fellow Kansan , joined the group in the final days last week .
Friends argue that the situation gives him an opportunity to show his power to get things done and be a dealmaker on historic legislation , as he has in the past on civil rights and the deficit .
But this hope is undercut by the tensions between Mr. Dole 's staff and that of the mainstream group and a sense that the Republican leader has retreated into an argument that it is already too late to act this year .
In a floor speech Friday evening , he disparaged the new plan as `` entry No. 8 .
'' And this 71-year-old would-be presidential candidate has taken to using health reform as a chance to cast himself as a champion of the younger Generation X , whose insurance costs would go up under the share-the-risk reforms in the moderate plan .
`` You had better tune in on health care , '' Mr. Dole said , `` because you are going to get stuck big time .
'' Kahler Corp. , Rochester , Minn. , said it plans to convert to a real estate investment trust and spin off a hotel management company to shareholders .
The company plans to merge into Kahler Realty , which has filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an offering of about seven million common shares .
Proceeds will be used to pay debt .
Kahler said the restructuring is subject to approval by a special meeting of shareholders , which it plans to hold later this year .
Through a series of steps , one share of Kahler common stock would be converted into one share of Kahler Realty stock and one-tenth of a share of Kahler Management Corp. , which is being formed to handle the hotel management , commercial-laundry and formal-wear business .
WASHINGTON -- When President Clinton renewed China 's trade privileges with the U.S. last May , he vowed to work with American companies to develop a code of business principles to promote human rights there .
But three months later the effort is languishing .
And for Beijing , it 's business as usual .
U.S. business representatives who have met recently with the administration have shown scant interest in a rigorous code that could be used to prod China to improve human rights .
Labor and human-rights groups , meanwhile , are pressing for standards that are tougher than American companies would ever accept .
As a result , the administration is increasingly unlikely to produce the kind of credible code that would be part of the `` new and vigorous '' human-rights program Mr. Clinton promised when he renewed China 's so-called most-favored-nation status .
`` There obviously has been a lot of resistance , '' concedes a senior administration official .
`` But we have n't pressed people in a serious way yet .
'' The administration is n't showing the same kind of half-heartedness when it comes to promoting U.S. commercial interests or strengthening official ties with Beijing .
Despite continued human-rights abuses in China , Commerce Secretary Ron Brown this week leads a delegation of U.S. corporate chiefs to China ; last week , Defense Secretary William Perry met in Washington with a top Chinese general to pave the way for a visit to Beijing by Mr. Perry in the fall .
U.S. officials insist that human rights will be on the agenda during these high-level contacts with China , but they certainly are n't the focal point of either Mr. Brown 's or Mr. Perry 's visit .
The signal received by Beijing may be the same one sent last spring , that human rights take a back seat to U.S. commercial interests .
While China 's political system wo n't be altered by a voluntary set of business principles for U.S. companies operating within its borders , the effort could be a potent symbol of U.S. concern , particularly now that Mr. Clinton has severed the link between China 's trade status and its human-rights performance .
So far , Mr. Clinton appears to be using the notion of business principles more as a figleaf than as a lever to effect change .
In a letter this month urging lawmakers not to reimpose human-rights conditions on China 's trade privileges , Mr. Clinton insisted that promoting human rights remains `` a cornerstone in our relations with China .
'' He listed the development of voluntary principles for businesses operating in China as part of the program .
`` Is this whole effort purely public relations or a serious attempt to get businesses engaged on human rights in China ?
'' asks Mike Jendrzeiczyk , Washington director of Human Rights Watch\/Asia , a private group .
`` We wo n't know until we see the results and how energetically the president remains involved in making sure that companies follow through .
'' Robert Kapp , president of the U.S.-China Business Council , which represents 260 companies engaged in China business , does n't want much follow-through at all .
`` I do have a problem with the notion that Americans are responsible for what we perceive to be the moral failings of any other society , '' says Mr. Kapp , who attended a recent meeting with U.S. officials to discuss a code of business conduct .
Many U.S. companies , of course , do take seriously codes of behavior they have set for themselves abroad .
Reebok International forced one of its contractors in China to move workers out of unsafe dormitories by threatening to cancel orders .
And Levi Strauss stopped doing business in China because it felt it could n't maintain its standards .
Meanwhile , Human Rights Watch\/Asia says China 's abuses continue .
On June 4 , only days after Mr. Clinton 's decision to continue its trade privileges , China criminalized many forms of civil protest , the group reports .
Among other things , new laws ban cooperation with nongovernment organizations outside China and make illegal the receipt of assistance from any group that Beijing deems to be a `` hostile organization , '' it said .
Human Rights Watch\/Asia concludes that Mr. Clinton 's decision `` to delink human rights and MFN has left the Chinese authorities with the impression that their repression of dissent will have no negative consequences .
'' To correct that impression , it adds , pressure from the international community -- government and business -- is essential .
Jimmy Carter fell in with the 1970s `` Limits to Growth '' crowd and soon was boring voters with his spiel that dwindling resources were responsible for double-digit inflation and gasoline lines .
The voters chose to blame Mr. Carter instead and sent him back to Georgia .
Now , Bill Clinton is consorting with neo-Malthusians , cousins of the Limits-to-Growthers .
Like the two-centuries-old lament of their patron saint , Thomas Robert Malthus , their cry is that the planet is nearing its `` load-bearing '' capacity .
A wiser president would have ignored these folks , but it 's too late now .
Neo-Malthusianism will be the driving force behind the U.N. 's Third International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo two weeks from now .
Leading the Clinton delegation will be -- who else ?
-- Vice President Al Gore .
Opinion polls show that Mr. Clinton 's support for this gabfest is losing him one of his strongest constituencies , Roman Catholic voters .
Cairo will bear a certain resemblance to the 1992 `` Earth Summit '' in Rio de Janeiro , where the U.N. marshalled Third World leaders to try to extract $ 140 billion from First World taxpayers .
But there is one big difference : At Rio , the goal was to save the planet from pollution ; at Cairo , it will be to save the planet from people .
Rio , while expensive , was relatively benign .
No one likes pollution .
But not everyone favors eliminating people , or more specifically , artificially controlling human reproduction .
Mr. Clinton thus invited a firestorm by supporting the U.N. 's main Cairo objective -- a 20-year program to curb world population growth .
The president has come under bitter attack from Pope John Paul II .
Clinton denials notwithstanding , the pope believes that Cairo will promote contraception , abortion , single-parent families and a whole pathology of casualness towards sex .
Rome has messaged all participants that the Cairo agenda invites `` moral decline .
'' Ads are appearing in American newspapers denouncing the Cairo gathering .
Other religious leaders are joining the outcry .
Cairo 's Al Azhar University , a center of Islamic thought , has just issued a statement saying that the U.N. document for the conference condones not only abortion , but also homosexuality , extramarital sex and possibly prostitution .
How did the president walk into this buzz saw ?
For one thing he seems to have a boundless appetite for U.N. guff .
Further , his surgeon general , Joycelyn Elders , is a loose cannon who goes out of her way to offend right-to-lifers .
Then there is former U.S. Sen. Timothy Wirth , a man who has achieved minor celebrity by keeping a supply of condoms in a silver bowl in his outer office .
Mr. Clinton early on appointed Mr. Wirth to a new State Department office which might be appropriately titled Undersecretary for the Export of Political Correctness .
Mr. Wirth can match the president in glib pieties about `` women 's issues '' and the like , and seems to be equipped with just as large a tin ear when critics of his hip gospel of permissiveness offer him their views .
Not all women think that women benefit from population control , at least not the way it is practiced in some parts of the world .
Coercive birth control programs in China and parts of India create a distinct bias against women , or more to the point , female babies .
Female infanticide is not unknown .
A Washington Post article last year reported a tilt of the normal male-female population balance heavily in favor of men in China , India , Bangladesh , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
They have a total combined deficit of 77 million women , the article said .
There also are hints of racism in the population control movement .
The fastest population growth is among people who have black , brown or yellow skins .
The idea that if white folks do n't do something they will be overwhelmed by the masses of a different color is not far below the surface in these deliberations , although it certainly is not politically correct to say that openly .
It is of course true that non-whites populate some of the world 's poorest regions and that these regions have high birth rates on the whole .
But some of the most intelligent studies suggest that neo-Malthusians get cause and effect reversed .
These places are n't poor because they have large populations .
They have large populations because they are poor .
Both India and China now are demonstrating that as families gain greater financial security , they emulate richer societies and have fewer babies .
Children are no longer seen as extra breadwinners or a bulwark against poverty in old age .
Skin color has little or nothing to do with it .
Many religious groups see population control as an interference with the natural order , a sentiment not unlike the one that motivates environmentalists to defend wilderness areas .
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Wirth both deny that they favor abortion for population control , but they have not been able to convince those significant numbers of people , in the U.S. and elsewhere , who find abortion abhorrent .
The U.S. already has a serious social problem reflected in picketing and attacks at abortion clinics .
Why on earth would a president want to invite the same thing on a global scale ?
Why indeed ?
Perhaps Mr. Clinton does n't find sufficient challenge in merely running a government .
As with Mr. Carter , he seems to feel a strong , even messianic , urge to tackle deep-seated social issues .
This kind of politics may win some support from those voters who think that politicians are good at moral crusades .
But when politicians venture into areas that many people think of as personal and intimate -- such as family planning and childbirth -- they are apt to quickly encounter diminishing returns .
This is particularly true if the crusade is built on doubtful premises .
The planet is not even close to the limits of its load-bearing capacity .
One of my friends is fond of pointing out , figuratively , that you could put all the people of the planet in the state of Texas with each family having enough land for a house and garden .
The 1960s predictions of a `` population explosion , '' based like today 's on a straight-line projection of the existing trend , have proved to be a gross exaggeration .
Thomas Malthus predicted that the world would soon be unable to feed its growing population .
He was dead wrong .
There is starvation in the world , but invariably because of wars and political bloody-mindedness .

Steve Morris admits his marriage lasted longer than he thought it would -- because of Jolson .
He just could n't bear to leave the little guy .
After all , Jolson had been with him on his wedding night nine years ago at the Pierre Hotel in New York .
But Mr. Morris did n't think he would get custody of Jolson , either -- let alone persuade a judge to hear his case .
Jolson is a dog .
When Mr. Morris and his wife divorced five years ago , they agreed to joint custody , with Mr. Morris getting Jolson on weekdays .
`` It 's really easy to ridicule the situation .
But if you love a dog , it becomes a member of your family , '' says Mr. Morris , a 40-year-old screenwriter in Santa Monica , Calif. .
He is now writing a romantic comedy focusing on the fluffy white `` bichon frise .
'' `` It 's bad enough with kids .
But someday kids will grow up and understand what happened to them .
Dogs will just feel the pain .
'' Such attitudes are n't unusual these days , as animal enthusiasts become more willing to admit -- and act on -- feelings about their pets .
Some pet owners now hire lawyers to fight for animal custody .
Dogs often trigger the most ferocious custody disputes , in part because they are more demonstrative and seemingly more emotionally dependent than other animals .
But people wage battles all over the animal kingdom , fighting for cats , parrots , even snakes , sometimes spending $ 10,000 or more to win custody .
While judges remain reluctant to hear such cases , some are starting to regard pets as more than chattel and will consider the animals ' best interests .
In one Florida case , a Dade County judge made a house call to see whether a Doberman pinscher had enough shade in the yard and easy access to the house , says Roger Galvin , a Rockville , Md. , criminal attorney who now devotes nearly a third of his practice to disputes over animals .
Most warring animal lovers negotiate out-of-court settlements establishing not just custody arrangements but visitation rights and pet support .
Jane Stern , executive director of Chicago 's Anti-Cruelty Society for animals , volunteered to pay her former husband about $ 135 a month in dog support in exchange for visitation and dog-sitting privileges .
`` This is my way of still being a part of his life , '' Ms. Stern says of Rowdy , her collie .
She and her ex-husband agreed that whoever remained in the couple 's condominium would keep Rowdy , so as to give him as much stability as possible .
`` I see enough dogs come into the Anti-Cruelty Society through divorce , and they do n't know what 's going on , '' she says , conceding that giving up the dog was the hardest part of a collapsing marriage .
Dogs may suffer depression after divorce , even as couples do , says Michael Fox , a vice president of the Humane Society of the U.S. .
They may refuse to eat , mutilate themselves , wreak havoc on the house and become extremely possessive .
Carrying around their old master 's sweater is one symptom .
In divorces , couples often use animals to win other concessions , with one spouse threatening to keep the pet unless he or she gets the apartment or more child support .
Animals are potent weapons , since they are sometimes the closest friend a person has after a painful breakup .
`` The one thing that 's not abandoning you is your pet , '' says Susan Cohen , director of counseling at the Animal Medical Center in New York .
`` To have someone interfere with that relationship is really a terrible thing .
'' Disputes between strangers can be just as agonizing , as is demonstrated by one recent New Jersey case involving a dog adoption gone bad .
In this saga , Joshua Marcus and his family decided to give away their dog after learning that Mrs. Marcus was pregnant with a third child .
To comfort his son and daughter , Mr. Marcus says he promised to find someone who would let the children visit their apricot poodle , Simintov , which means `` Good Sign '' in Hebrew .
The Marcus 's pet groomer , Bonnie Riso , found a home for the well-bred dog , and the new owner , Margaret Perry , allowed the children to see her pet once .
Nearly nine months later , Mr. Marcus says , he requested a second visit , but Mrs. Perry refused .
She says the Marcuses did n't say anything about visitation until after she had taken the dog .
Six-year-old Abigail Marcus was distraught .
`` I got him when he was a puppy , '' she says .
`` I was like his mother .
'' After it became clear that the visits were off , Mr. Marcus decided to sue for breach of an oral contract .
He consulted a retired judge to determine whether the matter would be deemed too frivolous for a lawsuit , and then proceeded .
`` We did this only because we loved our kids , '' he says .
`` We did n't want them to think they did n't have any rights .
'' The Perrys , who contend the Marcuses were harassing them , say they decided to fight back as a matter of principle and because they had developed an emotional attachment to the dog .
`` It became apparent to me these people lied to their children to ease the separation , '' says Joseph Perry , who spent $ 6,000 on legal fees in opposing the visitation .
One year of legal negotiations later , Ms. Riso offered a solution : Let the Marcuses visit the poodle during its regular grooming sessions at her shop , Canine Designs .
The Perrys agreed to six 10-minute reunions , supervised by Ms. Riso .
Abigail had her first 10-minute visit one recent Saturday .
`` I was really , really , really , really , really , really glad , '' says Abigail , who now has another poodle , Mitch , named after her attorney , Mitchell Liebowitz .
Dog capers ca n't always be negotiated to pet lovers ' satisfaction .
Harrison Miller , of Rockville , Md. , fled with a little black mutt named Buttons that he co-owned with his neighbor , Rockville City Councilman James Marrinan , after the two got into an argument about politics .
`` I was on the lam till I could figure out what I could do to get possession of this little animal , '' says Mr. Miller , who spent six months driving to Florida , up through the Midwest , and then back to Florida before private investigators tracked him down and made off with Buttons .
-LRB- At that point , Mr. Miller had yet to locate the check proving that he had paid for half a dog .
-RRB- He has n't seen Buttons since and misses the friend he used to take for rides on airplanes , motorcycles and boats .
All of which makes Mr. Morris 's arrangement with his ex-wife in California seem extremely civilized .
Better Friends Now Mr. Morris , known around town as `` the man with 2 1\/2 dogs , '' now lets his wife keep Jolson most of the time since he has remarried and has two other dogs and a two-year-old child .
He hired an animal behaviorist to help Jolson adjust to his step-siblings .
And he and his ex-wife , Beth Kotler , both say the dog has strengthened their relationship as divorced people .
When Jolson developed cataracts , Mr. Morris and Ms. Kotler spent a lot of time together in doctors ' offices talking about their lives .
Both anxiously waited through the surgery and went into the recovery room to help ease Jolson out of the anesthesia .
`` It made me love Steve for the daddy he was to his dog , '' she says .
`` I started caring for him as a friend .
'' Of course , not all dog stories have such happy endings .
One New York couple undergoing a bitter divorce ended up taking their argument over their dachshund to a local animal hospital , says Maureen Fredrickson , who was a pet counselor there at the time .
Neither husband nor wife trusted the other to take care of the dog , she said , so they had it destroyed .
`` I was very glad they did n't have children , '' she says .
Brokerage firms will find it more difficult to delay or prevent customers from arbitrating limited-partnership disputes and other claims , as a result of a recent ruling .
In a decision favorable to investors , a New York trial court judge found that New York courts do n't have jurisdiction to dismiss claims that certain out-of-state customers -- in this case investors in soured limited partnerships -- sought to have arbitrated in their home states .
In the past two years , brokerage firms increasingly have asked the New York courts to halt arbitrations , especially in limited-partnership cases , by invoking a controversial industry rule that bars claims based on investments made more than six years ago .
New York state courts have been more willing than those in other states to enforce the rule , which has been criticized as unfair to claimants .
And until the recent ruling the brokerage firms had argued successfully in a majority of cases that the New York courts were the proper place for the issue to be heard , even for out-of-state customers .
The latest ruling , by Judge Jane S. Solomon , is expected to settle the issue , however .
That is because Judge Solomon has been assigned to oversee all such requests to halt arbitrations filed by brokerage houses in state court in Manhattan , where most of the firms are based .
The practice has proved particularly controversial because if the brokerage firm wins on the eligibility-rule issue , the customer generally is left with no recourse : Arbitration is out because of the six-year limit , and complaints ca n't be brought in court because the customer has signed an arbitration agreement .
Critics have described it as a Catch 22 for investors , who at least in the limited-partnership cases argue that the securities firms prevented them from realizing that there was a problem until after the six years had elapsed .
In the case at issue in Judge Solomon 's ruling , Merrill Lynch & Co. argued that the customers consented to have the case heard in New York when they signed the standard arbitration agreement that is required of most customers .
That same argument has been espoused by several other major brokerage firms .
But Judge Solomon rejected that position , stating that the agreements do n't specify that the arbitrations must be held in New York .
`` If Merrill Lynch , a financial corporation that does business in every state of the union , wants to force its customers , no matter how far away , to litigate their claims only in New York , let it insert an express provision to such effect in the contracts it has its customers sign , '' she wrote .
She said the practical difficulties and expense of requiring customers to arbitrate in New York highlighted the `` fundamental unfairness '' of the practice , which critics have said has been used by brokerage houses only to deter claims by making them more costly and time consuming .
The brokerage firms deny the charges and say they are weeding out claims that eventually would be dismissed by arbitrators .
Judge Solomon also had an unkind word for plaintiff attorneys who she criticized for `` overreaching '' in some cases in attempting to bring claims that the industry rules bar .
The ruling is expected to apply to several other types of cases , including disputes with former employees and equity investors , in which brokerage firms also have sought to avoid arbitration .
It does n't apply to claims by New York residents , over whom the New York courts have jurisdiction .
Seth E. Lipner , a Garden City , N.Y. , attorney who has handled more than 100 such cases in New York for investors nationwide , said the decision allows customers to proceed with the claims before arbitrators in their home states , where the local law and local arbitrators are likely to be more receptive to their claims than the New York courts .
Lawrence E. Fenster , who represents several brokerage firms , including Merrill Lynch in the case before Judge Solomon , said the decision was wrong .
Mr. Fenster , an attorney with Orrick , Herrington & Sutcliffe in New York , said his client had n't decided whether to appeal .
-LRB- In re Merrill Lynch et al. vs. Barnum , Supreme Court of New York , No. .
An investor who exposed five brokerage houses to $ 2.9 million in potential losses in a `` free-riding '' scheme was sentenced to 27 months in prison and ordered to pay nearly $ 550,000 in restitution .
Peter S. Adler , 50 years old , of New York and Miami , previously pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud committed between 1987 and 1990 and another count of bank fraud in a 1992 scheme .
Mr. Adler , incarcerated for the past 16 months , is expected to serve only 11 more months to complete the sentence .
Mr. Adler 's lawyer , Bobbi Sternheim , had sought a lighter sentence , arguing that Mr. Adler suffered from diminished mental capacity as a result of psychological problems and addictions to cocaine and medication .
But U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in federal court in Manhattan said a harsher sentence was appropriate .
`` He knew what he was doing basically , '' the judge said .
`` He had the wit and the ability to calculate these fraudulent transactions .
'' Mr. Adler was accused of using shell corporations and fraudulent cash transfers to mislead the brokerage firms about the amount of money he had available to cover stock purchases .
In a free-riding scheme , an investor buys stock with little or no money down .
If the stock price goes up , the investor sells it , reimburses the brokerage firm that put up the purchase price , and pockets the difference .
If the stock drops in value , the brokerage firms are n't reimbursed .
Mr. Adler will make restitution of $ 278,296 to PaineWebber Group Inc. , First Fidelity Brokers Inc. , Datek Securities Corp. , GKN Securities Corp. , and KW Brown Investments .
He also was ordered to make restitution of $ 270,000 to Valley Bank of Nevada for the bank fraud .
Mr. Adler previously paid $ 230,164 to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission suit .
A Texas court judge awarded $ 123.6 million to a Dallas investor who accused Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. and its former vice chairman , Scott A. Beck , of breach of fiduciary duty .
The judge ordered Blockbuster ; Video Superstores Master L.P. , which was acquired by Blockbuster ; and Mr. Beck each to pay the plaintiff $ 36.3 million in punitive damages .
The three defendants also were ordered to pay a total of $ 14.7 million in actual damages and interest .
Mr. Beck is currently chairman and chief executive officer of Boston Chicken Inc. , which is n't a party to this lawsuit .
The case stems from a 1991 lawsuit filed by Charles D. Howell , who was an investor in a limited partnership formed in 1986 by Mr. Beck to own and operate video rental stores in the then-fledgling Blockbuster chain .
Three years later , Mr. Beck sold his interest in the partnerships to Blockbuster in a transaction valued at more than $ 110 million , according to the lawsuit , which alleged that the limited partnership investors did n't approve that transaction .
Further , Mr. Howell 's suit alleged that the limited partnership interests were n't acquired by Blockbuster until two years later .
G. Michael Gruber , the attorney for Mr. Howell , said he is pleased with the judge 's decision .
A Blockbuster spokesman said the video rental and music retailer based in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , will appeal the verdict .
He also said he does n't know how or when Blockbuster will account for the judgment in its financial results .
Mr. Beck could n't be reached for comment .
BankAmerica Corp. said a California judge upheld its system for resolving disputes with customers through arbitration .
The bank , based in San Francisco , was sued in August 1992 by the California Trial Lawyers Association , Consumer Action and others .
They argue that arbitration robs consumers of protections available in conventional lawsuits , such as the ability to compel release of company documents and join with other plaintiffs in classaction suits .
BankAmerica said its `` alternative dispute resolution system '' for deposit and credit-card accounts was upheld in a verbal ruling by Superior Court Judge Thomas Mellon .

Ayala Corp. of the Philippines said its unaudited consolidated net income for the first half surged 65 % to 1.61 billion pesos -LRB- $ 62.8 million -RRB- due to the strong earnings of its subsidiaries and a one-time gain from a unit 's sale of Ayala Land Inc. shares .
Net income totaled 976 million pesos a year earlier .
In a report to stockholders , Ayala Chairman and President Jaime Zobel de Ayala said , `` Business across Ayala 's various operations was strong , reflective of a much improved economic climate .
'' Alexander Pomento , an analyst of Baring Securities -LRB- Philippines -RRB- , Inc. , said the company posted 36 % growth in recurrent earnings to 1.34 billion pesos , excluding the one-time gain of 277 million pesos .
The company did n't disclose the amount of the gain in its report .
First-half results are in line with projections for the year of 2.6 billion pesos , up about 30 % from 1993 .
Ayala 's net is expected to be boosted from the strong showing of its real-estate arm , Ayala Land , and its food subsidiary , Purefoods Corp. .
Swedish industrial gas group AGA AB said its pretax profit increased 11 % in the first half , with second-half pretax profit forecast to increase at least at the same rate .

WASHINGTON -- Asia 's fast-developing countries are finding themselves at the heart of the current angst over global warming .
The latest studies warn that coastlines in Asia could be seriously threatened if nothing is done to stanch the flow of greenhouse gases piling up in the atmosphere .
Countries in the region are also likely to come under increasing pressure to become more efficient energy consumers at a meeting this week in Geneva that will address pledges to reduce these emissions .
The bad news comes in a set of massive studies that the Climate Institute , a Washington-based advocacy group , is releasing to eight developing nations in Asia .
By the year 2070 , according to the institute 's worst-case scenarios , much of the metropolitan area in Manila , Philippines , could be under a meter of water .
Waterline creep also could force the relocation of 3.3 million residents from portions of greater Jakarta in Indonesia , and imperil rice production in Vietnam 's Mekong and Red river deltas .
To be sure , climate science is still uncertain about the timing and magnitude of such natural events .
Some authorities remain unconvinced that the creation of so-called greenhouse gases -- particularly carbon dioxide , methane and nitrous oxide -- causes rising temperatures , more melting snow and thus higher sea levels .
They argue that the phenomena associated with global warming are simply normal variations in climate patterns .
The Climate Institute 's project , however , comes with respected credentials .
Experts from Australia 's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization provided the methodology for the project , and the individual country studies that resulted from it were conducted by the countries ' own scientists and researchers .
And these scenarios are n't totally implausible .
Crippling seasonal floods already are part of life in Manila , and sections of Jakarta have started to sink as a result of excessive pumping of ground water .
Ata Qureshi , the institute 's director for global environmental programs and the organizer of these studies , is now on the road trying to persuade Asian countries to do their part to spare the global environment from further abuse .
`` In the future , the Asian-Pacific region , with 75 % of the world 's population , will be the world 's largest source of greenhouse emissions , larger even than North America , '' he predicts .
He worries most about China and India , which have the world 's most ambitious energy-generation programs .
Most of the actions the studies recommend can pay back in other ways , the institute says , even if climatic change does n't prove to be as severe as anticipated .
For instance , the institute touts policy reforms that could make energy prices reflect their `` environmental costs .
'' Such an accounting would make `` natural gas preferable to coal , hydroelectric power even better , and geothermal and solar power the best '' sources for energy in Asia , says Mr. Qureshi .
Even if the predicted climatic disasters do n't occur , countries using cleaner fuel would still be rewarded with clearer air and lower health costs , the institute says .
It is also urging Asian countries to emulate the West by adopting energy-efficient fluorescent lamps , refrigerators and industrial motors .
Such actions would add billions of dollars to Asia 's development budgets .
But the institute warns that economic losses caused by rising sea levels could be far greater .
By 2010 , the cost of replacing Indonesian homes destroyed by floods could reach $ 8 billion at current prices , its studies say .
And for India , the losses from floods and coastline erosion could be as high as 0.18 % of its gross national product every year for 40 years .
In addition to the studies on Indonesia , India , the Philippines and Vietnam , the institute also completed country studies on Pakistan , Sri Lanka , Bangladesh and Malaysia .
A ninth study on China is still in preparation .
The studies were financed by the Asian Development Bank and the governments of Australia , Japan and Norway .
The U.S. and the European Union have already pledged to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 as part of their obligations under the 1992 convention on climate change in Rio de Janeiro .
Many energy-hungry Asian countries are also Rio signatories , and will be asked to make a comparable contribution .
The pressure for them to do so will start to build up at a Geneva meeting of Rio convention negotiators this week .
This meeting will set the stage for the higher-level Conference of the Parties next March , when each Rio signatory will announce what further actions it intends to take to reduce its emissions .
All this fuss has had one positive result for Asian countries : They are among the earliest recipients of Western aid designed specifically to alleviate global warming .
So far the region has attracted international support for $ 2.13 billion in various projects , according to a report by the Global Environment Facility , a World Bank-managed fund created by the Rio convention .
The GEF itself has a kitty of only $ 2 billion , but about $ 130 million of that has already been set aside for China , India , Thailand and the Philippines .
This assistance is different from other environment-related funding in that it is intended not only for the recipients ' specific benefit but also to help reduce or sequester global emissions .
Among the region 's aid recipients , the Philippines has captured the largest single share .
Its $ 1.3 billion program to expand geothermal-power generation will be financed by the World Bank , the Japan Export Import Bank , the GEF , the Swedish government and private contractors .
The Philippines also is drawing $ 173 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development for energy-conservation projects .
This is one global issue , too , in which Asian countries are likely to find the Clinton administration more helpful than obstructive .
President Clinton and Vice President Gore have taken the U.S. much further in support of the Rio convention than the Bush administration had been willing to go .
The U.S. is the largest national contributor to the Global Environment Facility , with $ 120 million already appropriated and an additional $ 210 million pledged .
The U.S. and China are at odds in other respects , but they are quietly cooperating on the global-warming front .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , for instance , is helping the Chinese design energy-saving refrigerators for mass distribution .
And the U.S. State Department says Washington is prepared to hand over enough new power-generation technology to the Chinese to enable them to reduce their dependence on conventional coal-burning plants .
ST. ALBANS , Vt. -- For over a century , the Central Vermont Railway has been a source of pride and jobs in this old railroad town near the Canadian border .
So when a brash Texan began walking around St. Albans criticizing the line , a lot of people were very unhappy .
And some were fearful .
The object of their ire is Bruce Flohr , chairman of RailTex Inc. , a growing San Antonio company that is trying to add the Central Vermont to its stable of 23 shortline railroads .
Workers are furious that the interloper seeks to scrap union contracts , cut 55 % of the employees and pay the rest 15 % less .
They vow to stop him .
Mr. Flohr is just as disdainful of the way the Central Vermont is run .
`` It is a relic of a bygone day , '' he says .
`` We are trying to make it a business , and they want to make this a personal vendetta .
'' The confrontation has meaning beyond the fate of this 325-mile railroad , important as that is to those involved .
Also at stake is the continued vibrancy of a revival going on among short-line railroads .
Resuscitated short lines are `` showing how nonproductive rail assets can be turned into cost-effective , service-sensitive and profitable railroads , '' says F. Colin Pease , an executive of railroad operator Guilford Transportation Industries Inc. in North Billerica , Mass. .
The outcome in Vermont could determine whether major railroads will continue to sell their weaker operations to entrepreneurs rather than seek to abandon them .
By cutting costs and improving service , companies such as RailTex have preserved hundreds of broken-down light-density freight lines and retained rail service to small shippers and rural communities .
In Vermont , some firms say they will expand and hire more workers if the Central Vermont is sold to RailTex and offers lower shipping rates .
But railroad unions assail the price in lost railroad jobs , lower rail wages and discarded work rules .
At the heart of the fight is an Interstate Commerce Commission policy of encouraging outsiders to invest in lightly used freight lines that big railroad companies might find not worth saving .
As an incentive , the ICC in such cases declines to require that the labor contract be bought out -- as it does when one railroad acquires another .
Proponents say the decade-old policy has preserved lines that would have died .
Short lines -- many of them carved out under the policy -- operate 26 % of the nation 's track today , up from 6 % in 1970 , according to the Association of American Railroads .
But rail unions say the rule exempting nonrailroad companies from honoring labor agreements is just a loophole .
Often the seller retains control of freight traffic and rates , they say .
`` The whole short-line trend is essentially a subcontracting of railroad operations to get out of union contracts , '' contends James Brunkenhoefer , an official of the United Transportation Union , which is trying to organize RailTex 's new short lines .
-LRB- It has succeeded in two cases in Texas .
-RRB- Vermont 's Rep. Bernard Sanders , an Independent who is an avowed socialist , has proposed federal legislation to slow or stop the trend .
His bill , which has considerable Democratic support , would require that all workers displaced by the sale of a rail line be paid as much as six years of wages and benefits .
Rail unions say the bill sends a strong message to the ICC , which has said lately that it will scrutinize short-line sales more closely for fairness to rail labor .
Should it decide the RailTex purchase of the Central Vermont is n't exempt from labor-buyout provisions , the agency could be signaling a broad policy change .
Investors see a grave threat to the boom in short lines .
`` Once organized labor puts a stake through Mr. Flohr 's heart , they strike back at all regional railroads , '' says Anthony Kruglinski , president of Railroad Financial Corp. , a Chicago investment bank .
Mr. Flohr has become a visible target .
Before short lines began proliferating as big roads sold off pieces , railroading was almost totally unionized , inflexible and high-cost .
Mr. Flohr 's RailTex hired nonunion workers , asked them to handle various tasks instead of being restricted to a single one , and became the nation 's largest and fastest-growing operator of small railroads .
Last year , aided by acquisitions of three more lines , RailTex boosted its net income 34 % to $ 3.6 million on a 52 % revenue increase to $ 59.8 million .
It went public last fall .
A former Southern Pacific executive who briefly headed the Federal Railroad Administration , Mr. Flohr , 54 , is a tireless promoter of rail transport .
To it , he applies management methods learned from studying cafeteria and supermarket chains .
A `` Go Team '' is dispatched to the scene to assist with restarting the stretch of track as a RailTex short line .
Later , RailTex officials hold a `` grand opening '' with a Texas-style barbecue and a locomotive breaking a banner .
Mr. Flohr also sends employees , customers and securities analysts Thanksgiving gift boxes with samples of cereal , light bulbs , lubricants , candy bars , plastic toys and other consumer products whose ingredients ride on RailTex short lines .
But a RailTex takeover can be painful .
After the company bought and leased a 525-mile line from Union Pacific Corp. in December 1992 , its Go Team ran a train into a collision with a Burlington Northern freight , causing some injuries .
The first general manager was removed .
The new Missouri & Northern Arkansas Railroad , based in Carthage , Mo. , started out with less than half the employees , paid less .
`` I do the same work I 've been doing 20 years , for half the money , '' says Jim Cavener , a conductor , who now earns $ 26,000 on the Missouri & Northern Arkansas .
`` It hurts me every time I get on this engine .
'' Grant Moore took a similar pay cut when he went to work for the new outfit .
Still , he says his $ 26,000-a-year position `` is one of the better-paying jobs in the area .
'' To make up for his lost wages , Mr. Moore , who also runs a small farm , has increased the number of calves he raises .
The takeover has meant other changes .
`` Here , I 'm an engineer one day and a car repairman the next , '' says Tracy Ferguson , who also spikes track and takes calls from customers -- all jobs performed by separate crafts on a unionized railroad .
He likes it this way .
`` It never makes for a boring day , '' he says , adding that he feels more of a sense of pride by being able to contribute in so many different ways .
The new railroad has used the savings to hire salesmen , double train service and restore sidings to small shippers deemed too expensive to serve by Union Pacific .
On one occasion , the Missouri & Northern Arkansas ran an unscheduled train from Batesville , Ark. , to a local Tyson Foods Inc. feed mill that was in danger of running out of grain .
Satisfied with its rail service , Tyson , based in Springdale , Ark. , now plans to build a second mill along the Missouri & Northern Arkansas .
Carmar Group , a Carthage company that operates a warehouse in an old limestone mine , says the new railroad recently brought it a new customer , a paper producer looking for a Midwest warehouse .
`` I do n't remember Union Pacific bringing us a customer in 23 years , '' says Roy Mayes , Carmar 's chairman .
`` To a big railroad , we 're a bump on a pickle , but with them we 're treated like a big customer .
'' The payoff : Carloadings , which had been declining under Union Pacific management , have grown 22 % since RailTex took over the line .
Employment , which at first plunged to 51 workers from around 120 under the former owner , has climbed back to 95 .
The new rail company cultivated local support with free passenger rides and food at Carthage 's Maple Leaf Festival .
RailTex `` may not be a candidate for a ticker-tape parade , '' says Neil Campbell , a columnist for the Carthage Press , `` but they 're not villains in town .
'' Mr. Flohr hoped for a similar reaction in St. Albans .
The Central Vermont runs from the Canadian border to New London , Conn. , traversing scenic mountain passes and pretty New England villages .
Twice a year , a helicopter patrols it , looking for beaver ponds that might burst and flood out track .
But the scenic region has fewer manufacturers than it once did , and parent company Canadian National Railway Co. found the marginally profitable line no longer fit its plans .
RailTex won the road with a $ 40 million bid in April , and now awaits only a favorable ICC ruling .
The backlash that followed dismayed RailTex officials .
Employees , infuriated by RailTex plans to cut the payroll to 78 workers from 178 , fought back with pickets , rallies , petitions and meetings with politicians .
`` We are fighting it now and will continue to fight it to the end , '' says Anna Lambert , a clerk .
Central Vermont workers have enjoyed generations of secure employment .
`` Anyone who worked for the railroad in St. Albans , Vt. , was as good as working for the federal government , '' says Norm Gosselin , a mechanic and second-generation railroader .
`` Once you started with the railroad , you had a job for life .
Now , it 's very shaky .
'' For those who will lose these jobs , most other work they can get in the area would pay considerably less .
Rep. Sanders vows to make St. Albans the `` Waterloo for RailTex .
'' He says derailing RailTex `` will be a victory for all workers in America who are seeing their standard of living lowered , jobs sent to Third World countries or unions broken .
'' What may distress rail workers in St. Albans , of course , could help many other New Englanders .
Several shippers along the line are holding off on expansion plans , waiting to see if the rail deal goes through .
With lower wages and fewer employees , RailTex could `` afford to price a little more competitively , '' says Roger Desrosier , owner of a warehouse in Monson , Mass. `` If the Central Vermont is sold to RailTex , we 'll expand and add jobs , '' he says .
In St. Albans itself , QST Inc. , a producer of raw materials for plastic lawn furniture , is considering a plant enlargement that would create another 10 or 12 jobs , depending on the Central Vermont 's rates and service .
`` Anything that improves rail service in Vermont allows us to serve more customers , '' says Lawrence Monty , QST 's president .
A RailTex takeover `` might cost rail jobs here but gain manufacturing jobs , '' he says .
Rep. Sanders bristles nevertheless at the audacity of RailTex , which creates a new , initially nonrailroad subsidiary each time it plans to buy a rail line , thereby skirting labor protection required by the ICC when one railroad buys another .
`` How in God 's name , when you have a company that owns 23 railroads , can you say you 're not a railroad ?
'' demanded Mr. Sanders , pointing his finger at Mr. Flohr during a U.S. Senate hearing here last month .
`` At least in the state of Vermont , you are not going to get away with what you have gotten away with in the rest of the country .
'' Such opposition mystifies Mr. Flohr .
`` We 're not buying it to tear it up but to build it up , '' he says .
`` We have to get lean and mean before we can do that .
'' He says displaced workers would be the first to be hired for RailTex openings here or elsewhere , and the company would pay moving costs .
Undeterred , Mr. Flohr drives through St. Albans the morning after the hearing , noting to a subordinate the things likely to change after a RailTex takeover .
After a general manager is appointed , the staff of 29 clerks could be cut to six , he says .
Surplus track in sprawling Italy yard north of town could be redeployed .
Mr. Flohr says the Central Vermont 's ornate 1866 headquarters building , with its fireplace and outdoor fountain , should be sold or donated .
Cost-cutting opportunities abound .
While most lines now operate freight trains with two-member crews , Central Vermont trains have as many as four or five crew members .
`` We 're the last of the Mohicans , '' says flagman Randy Heald as he climbs aboard a bright orange caboose .
Most railroads have retired their cabooses , but union contracts still require them on 25 % of Central Vermont trains .
In the line 's old brick roundhouse , quiet except for the hum of wall fans , four mechanics emerge from the shadows .
They and other mechanics have job guarantees , won in exchange for a wage freeze , but little work to do since Canadian National began to operate Central Vermont trains with locomotives serviced in Montreal .
`` We get insulted when people say we do n't have anything to do , '' says shop foreman Allen Lehmann , adding that mechanics have kept busy fixing broken windows , maintaining the turntable or inspecting the shop 's overhead crane .
The workers see the RailTex plan to disturb this tranquility as `` a test case .
'' Says Mr. Gosselin , the Central Vermont mechanic , `` If it happens here , it will snowball .
'' U S WEST Inc. -LRB- Englewood , Colo. -RRB- -- Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group affirmed its ratings on this telecommunications company and lowered its ratings on the commercial paper of its U S West Capital Funding Inc. unit to single-A-1 from single-A-1-plus .
U S West has about $ 3.4 billion of rated debt outstanding .
Ratings of the U S West Communications Inc. subsidiary were n't on CreditWatch and were n't affected .
U S West 's ratings had been placed on CreditWatch following announcement of the planned $ 1.2 billion acquisition of two cable-television operators serving the Atlanta area .
S&P said the ratings actions reflect the company 's `` increased tolerance for financial risk and the weaker interest coverage measures that will result '' from the acquisitions and related necessary capital spending .
Despite the strength of its local telephone subsidiary , U S West increasingly is being affected by its cable-TV and cellular-telephone businesses , as well as expansion of its wireless business , S&P said .
A U S West spokeswoman said the company is n't surprised by S&P 's action on the commercial paper because the earlier rating had been higher than that of Moody 's Investors Service Inc. .
She said U S West does n't agree with S&P 's concern that future investments by the company will have `` negative consequences , '' and said the company will `` work with the rating agency to calm any fears they have .
'' Pioneer Electronic Corp. , a Japanese electronic products maker , said its first-quarter pretax , or recurring profit on a consolidated basis , of 2.25 billion yen -LRB- $ 22.8 million -RRB- fell 44 % from 4.03 billion yen a year earlier .
Pioneer said the sharp drop in its earnings to 257 million yen from 6.86 billion yen the previous year was due partly to an operating loss of 432 million yen that resulted from the yen 's appreciation and increased competition world-wide .
However , the main reason for the decline was the company 's high net profit the previous year , when it gained 4.88 billion yen as the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting standard .
The company does n't disclose the forecast for its consolidated earnings .
In Tokyo Stock Exchange trading , Pioneer shares closed at 2,720 yen , down 80 yen .
Mexican glass maker Vitro SA said Thursday it has formed an alliance with Pechiney SA of France to invest $ 70 million in a venture to produce and sell aluminum cans in Mexico and Central America .
Each company will control half of the new venture , Vitro said .
After construction of a plant here , the venture hopes to begin operation in the second quarter of 1995 .
Vitro , based in the northern city of Monterrey , will provide services and administrative support to the venture and Pechiney will provide technical assistance through its American National Can unit .
The venture is a first for both companies .
Vitro , a leader in flat glass , plastics and bottle production , does n't currently produce aluminum cans .
The venture will represent Pechiney 's first investment in Mexico .
The deal is subject to the approval of both companies ' boards and requires the signature of a definitive agreement .
STORM KING MOUNTAIN , Colo. -- Acres of forest here smoldered for days , the surrounding air too still and bereft of oxygen for flames to thrive .
On the afternoon of July 6 , however , a cold front arrived , its winds bearing fresh air and peril .
Among the 52 firefighters on the mountain that afternoon , few realized how deadly conditions had become .
Even after their commander ordered them to retreat , many walked when they should have run .
Brad Haugh did neither .
He stood in the shade of a scraggly juniper tree on a steep hill here , waiting for a crew of firefighters to clear the ridge below him .
They were from out of state , and as a local , he felt obligated to make sure they found their way out .
Then he saw something that few human beings have ever seen , and fewer still have lived to describe .
As the cool wind blowing up the canyon struck the overheated , oxygen-starved fire , a tremendous roar rose from below , and a red-black fireball began racing up the mountain at amazing speed .
Turning , Mr. Haugh ran for his life .
Today , investigators from the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service will release their analysis of what went wrong here , and how 14 people died in the worst firefighting disaster in U.S. history .
The report is expected to address the adequacy of leadership , training , equipment , communication and support the crews got that day .
It will ask whether they received sufficient briefing on escape routes and whether their commanders acted quickly enough .
The report will also advise how to avoid such disasters , and thus it could change the way wildfires are fought in the West .
All along , some survivors have insisted that the so-called blowup that day -- strikingly similar to the 1949 Mann Gulch fire in Montana that killed 13 -- was so bizarre and sudden that all blame belongs with nature .
`` It happened fast enough that none of us knew we were in danger , '' says Michelle Ryerson , who survived the fire .
`` It happened in a matter of seconds .
'' Of the 3,000 men and women who fought forest and grassland fires in Colorado that deadly week in July , 38 will stand out for having survived the South Canyon fire near Glenwood Springs .
This is the story of two of them , Mr. Haugh , 32 , and Ms. Ryerson , 28 .
Started by a lightning strike on Storm King Mountain , the South Canyon fire for several days lapped lazily at the forest around it without spreading beyond 20 acres .
Ms. Ryerson and Mr. Haugh , who both live nearby , were part of the first crew to reach the fire , on July 5 .
The crew hiked up the mountain , cleared a helicopter landing spot and then cut a fire line .
As they climbed down the mountain that evening , they stopped to watch eight smoke jumpers parachute in and land on top of the ridge .
Moments later , the jumpers called on the radio to report that the fire had jumped the line the local crew had spent all day constructing .
Early the next morning , Mr. Haugh , Ms. Ryerson and nine other Colorado-based firefighters set out to return to the fire , armed with four chain saws and dressed in standard firefighter attire : green wool trousers , long-sleeved yellow shirts and hard hats .
There was no trail .
From an exit along Interstate 70 , the crew scrambled up a deep gulch clogged with brush and low rock cliffs .
The gulch branched into several smaller ravines separated by ridges that ran up the slope steeply toward the top ridge , which was their destination .
Mr. Haugh , a 5-foot-10-inch runner and weight lifter , picked his way along the crest of one of the ascending ridges .
With five gallons of water on his back , he would walk a few yards until his temples started pounding , then stop and rest .
Ms. Ryerson and the others carried tools , saws and gasoline .
They reached the crest of the ridge at 9:30 .
To the north , the ridge rose to Storm King Mountain , 2,000 feet above them .
To the west , in plain view , lay a subdivision called Canyon Creek , and far below them was the highway .
On the ridge , the incident commander , Butch Blanco , who was in charge of the crews on the ground , and the smokejumper boss , Don Mackey , planned the day 's work while the local firefighters caught their breath and met the smoke jumpers .
Like the many other firefighters who would arrive that day , the jumpers came from faraway places like Idaho and Montana .
Many of the firefighters who would flee for their lives that afternoon belonged to crews that had never met .
The jumpers had worked most of the night cutting a fire line along the top of the ridge .
They planned to extend that line while the local crew widened it by 10 feet on either side .
They decided to cut a new helicopter pad on the ridge , lower than the one the local crew had cleared the day before and easier to reach .
As is standard procedure at forest fires , they also agreed on escape routes and safe zones .
The weather report had predicted that a cold front would move in later in the afternoon , and the crews talked about it .
The firefighters were optimistic that the colder air would provide some relief , maybe even rain .
It was 10 a.m. when the firefighters got started building another fire line -- the hot , hard work of cutting down shrubs and trees and scraping the earth clean .
It was already about 90 degrees , and gusty winds blew down the mountain .
Mr. Haugh , an Ohio native who divorced a year ago and lives with a Chesapeake Bay retriever named Mesa , started his chain saw and began cutting pinyon trees , junipers and scrub oaks .
Derek Brixey , a Canon City , Colo. , firefighter , worked as his `` swamper , '' pulling the cuttings away and throwing them into the woods .
Another sawyer and swamper worked the other side of the line .
Behind them , others , including Ms. Ryerson , scraped the ground with their Pulaskis , which are heavy tools with a two-part head : one part hoe , one part ax .
While they worked , a plane flew over .
Mr. Haugh rested a moment to watch it .
`` More jumpers , '' he said happily .
He watched the jumpers land along the ridge closer to Storm King Mountain and saw the plane circle back and dump some cargo .
Erratic winds were picking up , sometimes coming up the east side of the ridge , sometimes up the west , and the fire made a sudden run toward the original helicopter site .
The crew moved ahead to cut and burn the brush between the fire line and the advancing fire , enforcing the hand-cut line with `` black , '' as firefighters call a burned area .
The fire 's advance was stopped for the time being .
They cut down a tree that had caught fire across the line and smashed the limbs till it went out .
Some of the crew stayed with Ms. Ryerson near the helicopter pad , but Mr. Haugh and his swamper split off to work on a new line that headed down off the ridge to the west .
They widened the steep new line , attacking the dense brush .
About noon , a crew of hot shots -- elite Forest Service firefighters -- from Prineville , Ore. , arrived by helicopter , and eight to 10 of them marched past Mr. Haugh .
They walked in usual firefighter fashion : in a straight line , five feet apart , holding their tools on the downhill side .
Now there were 52 firefighters on the mountain .
About 2 p.m. , Mr. Haugh and his swamper broke for lunch .
Sitting next to a tree , Mr. Haugh ate a cold can of peas .
As he opened a can of Beanie Weenies , the ring on the pull-off lid broke .
Cursing , he pulled out his knife and cut the lid off , a procedure that delayed by about five minutes his return to work .
Later , he would conclude that those five minutes might have saved his life .
An hour later , about 3:00 , up on the ridge-top , Ms. Ryerson was walking up and down the fire line .
A former flight attendant who had traversed Europe and the Middle East , she had returned to her native state , and this morning her parttime career as a firefighter had reached a new height : The incident commander had named her squad boss , in charge of the crew she had hiked in with .
Now , the commander had asked her to walk up the line and check the fire 's progress .
It was a needed break ; a tall but slender woman , she was beginning to tire from the second full day of climbing and building fire line .
And now , some of the hot shots were working with her squad , and the fire line was in good shape .
They could spare her for a few minutes .
She walked up along the ridge toward the first day 's helicopter pad and turned around .
The fire had jumped the line below her .
She called Mr. Blanco and asked for a couple of buckets of water to be dropped by helicopter .
The first bucket missed ; the second doused the fire .
Ms. Ryerson walked back to her squad .
She heard Mr. Mackey on the radio , calling from somewhere down the line that dropped west off the ridge .
`` It 's getting pretty hot .
Let 's bump everybody out of here , '' he said .
He said it again , urgently .
`` Get everybody out of here .
'' Then the voice of Mr. Blanco , the incident commander , squawked from the radio : `` Retreat to the original helispot , '' he ordered .
The helispot had been chosen as a safe spot in the morning meeting on the ridge .
The command scared her , and she called back as if to assure herself that everything was fine .
`` Are you sure you want us to go ?
'' she asked .
After lunch , Mr. Haugh sharpened his saw and he and his swamper went back to work .
The wind was gusting harder , blowing up one section of the mountain and down another in a circle .
After awhile , Mr. Haugh paused to let the chain saw cool .
`` What time do you think it is ?
'' Mr. Brixey asked , playing a guessing game they had played all day .
`` About 2:30 , '' Mr. Haugh guessed .
The swamper pulled out his watch and laughed .
For the first time that day , Mr. Haugh was wrong .
`` It 's 3:27 .
'' The two men sat on their haunches and drank some water .
Mr. Haugh had kept two gallons on his back as he worked , and he finished off his first gallon .
As they rested , a firefighter he did n't know walked up from below and told them to pick up their tools and head back to the ridge .
`` The crews are coming out , bump up , '' he said .
Mr. Brixey headed to the top of the ridge , only about 50 yards up the steep incline , with the saw .
Mr. Haugh waited on the spot where they had quit working to make sure the hot shots who had traveled down the trail were coming back up .
From somewhere on the mountain , the incident commander came on the radio .
`` Retreat to a safe zone , '' he ordered .
From that moment , things on the mountain started falling apart .
Waiting under his juniper tree for the hot-shot crew to clear the ridge below him , and listening to the chaos spreading across the mountain , Mr. Haugh started to worry .
It was an unfamiliar feeling .
Like others on the line that day , Mr. Haugh had fought dozens of forest fires and had grown complacent about the danger .
He never checked his portable fire shelter -- it was supposed to be taken out and examined every two weeks .
He knew a fellow firefighter -LRB- not on this crew -RRB- who left his shelter behind and used its pouch to carry food and water .
As he waited for the crew below , he calmed himself .
`` It 's an orderly retreat ; it 'll be OK , '' he thought .
A strong wind had started to blow up the valley below him from the river , feeding oxygen to the fire .
Flames jumped from the ground into the trees .
From where he stood , Mr. Haugh could n't yet see the blaze , but he could see the spot fires it was throwing ahead of itself .
One ignited the slope across the deep valley to the west , and he radioed the incident commander to tell him about it .
`` I see it !
Get out of there and do n't tie up the radio , '' the commander ordered .
`` I 'll be out as soon as I have the crew in sight , '' he yelled back .
Finally , he saw two smoke jumpers climb over the small ridge about 200 yards below him and head up the line .
Then , a few yards behind them , the crew appeared , still in perfect formation , trudging up the steep incline with their tools .
The sawyer was leading , carrying his saw on his shoulder .
Kevin Erickson , a smoke jumper from Missoula , Mont. , reached Mr. Haugh first , and they watched the crew approach .
No one was panicking or running , and Mr. Erickson had time to snap a couple of photographs of the advancing crew .
Then a tremendous roar rose up from below the ridge behind the crew .
It sounded like the tornadoes Mr. Haugh had witnessed back on the family farm in Ohio , and it raised the hair on the back of his neck .
`` Drop your gear and run !
Get the hell out of here !
'' Mr. Haugh yelled down to the slowly approaching crew .
He looked up the ridge .
His swamper was gone .
He had flown over the ridge and down a ravine to safety .
James Thrash , a smoke jumper from Idaho , ran up the trail ahead of the crew .
`` Do you think we should deploy ?
'' he shouted at Mr. Haugh above the roar , asking if they should pull out their shelters and cover themselves on the ground .
`` No , '' yelled Mr. Haugh , surveying the high brush around them .
It was n't a good place to deploy .
`` We 've got to run .
We 've got to get out of here .
'' He looked back at the crew and saw the fire explode behind the ridge below them .
A solid wall of roiling orange , red and black rolled over the ridge , blasting through trees and shrubs , racing up the hill .
Mr. Haugh ran .
He scrambled for the ridge , seeing nothing but the ground ahead .
His mind raced crazily .
The ground had turned an eerie shade of red .
`` This must be what Mars looks like , '' he thought , recalling his childhood fascination with `` The Martian Chronicles .
'' Then he thought , `` Gee , you 're running for your life , and you 're thinking about Mars ?
'' Then he realized he actually was running for his life .
His temples pounded , but he kept running .
He was nearly at the ridge top when the intense heat of the fire behind him pushed against his back .
It burned through one of his sleeves and seared his elbow .
He was breathing like a racehorse and feared the heat would scorch his lungs .
He watched his feet move up the steep slope , surprised that he could run this fast .
Scrambling through brush , he reached the ridge top and the fire line he had helped widen early that day .
A Dolmar -- a can of oil and gas for the chain saw -- sat on the ridge top , swollen to twice its normal size .
For a split second he considered moving it out of the way of the crew behind him , but decided it would explode if he touched it .
He started to turn around to look back at the fire , but remembered how Lot 's wife had turned to look at Sodom and Gomorrah and turned to salt .
`` Too much Sunday school , '' he mused .
Cresting the ridge , he crashed down the other side .
Behind him , the fire roared up the slope , sending flaming missiles up over the top , lighting spot fires in the forest around him .
He heard the Dolmar explode .
He slid on rocks and sand and fell over bushes and spun around trees .
After about a hundred yards , he looked back .
The wall of fire was crossing the ridge above him .
The fire line was n't holding .
He turned and ran and slid again , crashing into a tree 100 yards farther down .
His hard hat flew off and skidded down the hill and out of sight .
Pain shot up his leg .
`` I broke it , '' he thought , panicking .
He pulled himself up .
The leg was pounding with pain , but it was n't broken .
`` Wuss , '' he swore at himself .
`` It 's not hurt .
Cowboy-up and get out of here .
'' Before he got to his feet , Mr. Erickson suddenly ran toward him .
`` How do I get out of here ?
'' he screamed .
Eric Hipke , a smoke jumper from Seattle , ran out of the trees toward them , holding his hands in front of him .
He had lost his helmet and had used his hands to protect his ears from the heat .
The tactic saved his ears , but burning flesh was hanging from his hands and arms .
Without a word , the three crashed down the slope .
As the fire crested the ridge , it slowed-fire burns faster uphill than down .
That gave the men time to stop at a clearing , where they wrapped makeshift cloth bandages around Mr. Hipke 's hands .
They poured Mr. Haugh 's last gallon of water over the bandages and then took off again , sliding down a ravine .
They ran into Mr. Blanco and some others .
Crashing down the slope with other firefighters behind him , Mr. Haugh watched for fire -- he knew the way , but the others feared they would run headlong into another fireball that could be racing up the ravine toward them .
Finally -- it seemed like hours , although it had taken only 20 minutes to escapethey reached the highway , where vehicles were already waiting for them .
An ambulance took away Mr. Hipke and Mr. Erickson , who also had been burned .
Up on the ridge , Ms. Ryerson had confirmed the order to retreat and shouted to her crew and the hot shots working with them to follow her to the original helispot .
They started scrambling up the steep incline , but she quickly realized it was too far and she was too tired .
`` I ca n't make it , '' she gasped to the hot-shot boss running with her .
`` We ca n't make it .
'' The hot shot agreed .
`` GO !
GO !
GO !
'' he yelled at the advancing crew , waving to turn them around to head the other way .
They ran for the other safe zone they had picked that morning -- the new helispot on the lower part of the ridge line to the north .
Smoke filled the air and blotted out the sun .
A small flame had slopped over the line again , and they ran through it .
By the time Ms. Ryerson reached the second helispot with the crew , the red-orange firestorm was racing up the mountain toward them .
Embers flew and hit the sides of their faces and their arms .
The smoke burned their lungs .
They threw down their tools and spread out in confusion .
Ms. Ryerson ran along the ridge with a sawyer she knew and some of the hot shots , trying to stay ahead of the fire , which was now chasing them north as it climbed .
Then a leg of the fire outran them , crossing the ridge in front of them .
She stopped .
`` I do n't think we can make it -- let 's deploy , '' she shouted .
She did n't believe they were going to survive .
`` We can if you want , but let 's see how far we can make it , '' her sawyer said .
A smoke jumper ran by them .
`` Which way do we go ?
'' he yelled .
`` I do n't know , '' she yelled back .
`` I do n't know , '' echoed the hot shots ' boss .
As she pulled out her shelter and tucked it under her arm , the incident commander yelled over the radio from somewhere on the mountain `` Run down the ravine , '' and she and the others plunged down .
Having hiked in that morning , she and others in her crew knew the way ; that probably saved her life .
She could n't run fast enough .
She felt as if she were in a nightmare , running in slow motion .
She slipped and fell , over and over , trying to follow three hot shots plunging down the steep ravine in front of her .
Over and over , her sawyer helped her up and urged caution .
`` It 'll be harder to get out of here with a broken leg , '' he told her .
When they finally saw the highway below them , she panicked .
`` I 'm the squad boss and I do n't know where my squad is , '' she realized .
-LRB- When Ms. Ryerson reached the ambulances waiting at the bottom of the hill , she saw that her entire crew had escaped .
-RRB- Telling her story later , Ms. Ryerson says she has had recurring nightmares about the fire .
But she is ready to return to firefighting .
In fact , she hopes to move up the Bureau of Land Management 's firefighting ladder to a job at the headquarters in Boise , Idaho .
Mr. Haugh , standing next to the charred remains of the juniper tree where he had waited for the crew , watches the hot wind tearing apart 12 baskets of flowers , each marking the spot where a firefighter perished .
-LRB- Two others died farther up Storm King Mountain to the north .
-RRB- As he looks around the high ridge , he finds no answer to the question that has haunted him since that day : why he lived and others did n't .
`` A lot of those guys had wives and kids or they had their whole lives ahead of them , '' says Mr. Haugh .
`` I 've already had a pretty good life .
I keep trying to figure out why I survived .
'' Later , having surveyed the scene , Mr. Haugh says that `` fast feet and strong legs were the key .
'' But luck played a role , too .
The five minutes he spent opening the can of Beanie Weenies with a knife kept him from working farther down the fire line .
If he had been a little lower when he stopped and waited for the crew , he might not have beaten the fire to the top .
The night of the fire , as dozens of relatives of the firefighters called the Bureau of Land Management to see whether their loved ones had lived or died , Mr. Haugh 's girlfriend came with his dog and spent the night .
A firefighter herself , she understands the decision he has made since July 6 : Up to now a seasonal firefighter , he wants to make it a full-time job .
Advertisers , struggling to win the hearts of cynical young consumers , are using a new medium to attract this value-conscious generation : free postcards .
This summer , sleek black postcard racks have been popping up in New York bars , restaurants and even health clubs catering to the fashionable crowd .
The advertisers , which include fashion designer Donna Karan , Absolut vodka , Tanqueray gin and clothing retailer Oaktree , say the postcards get them onto the hippest real estate and communicate their message subtly , without irritating even the most media-numbed consumer .
`` This is a different way to reach people without them necessarily realizing it , '' says Patrick Morley-Fletcher , advertising manager for Hennessy cognac .
`` You could almost imagine buying this postcard from a rack in a poster store .
'' Richard Lewis , senior vice president at Omnicom Group 's TBWA Advertising , proudly cites reports that Absolut Warhol postcards are flying off the racks .
`` It 's a commercial message , '' he says , `` but it 's subtle enough to be something of value .
'' For its second round of postcards , Dewar 's Scotch replaced its first design -- which reproduced its print-ad campaign -- with a simple black and white close-up of a bulldog .
Only after turning over the card does the reader see the Dewar 's name and a slogan : `` A man 's dog and his drink should never have cutesy names .
'' Indeed , because the advertiser 's name and slogan are often placed on the back of the card , many customers do n't realize the postcards are ads at all .
At Casa La Femme late Thursday night , two young patrons admired the array of cards -- depicting everything from a couple toasting each other at the beach to an art-deco rendering of a Hennessy martini .
`` These are pretty cool , '' says Maurice Caple , his sunglasses pushed up on his shaved head .
`` I like this one , '' says his friend , pointing to the couple at the beach .
Did she know the postcard is an advertisement for Club Med ?
`` Is it really ?
'' she says .
Two postcard advertising companies have already popped up to serve the new medium .
Both Five Finger and Gitter\/Anapol Communications started postcard operations in June and say they have no room on their racks for new advertisers until October .
While Five Finger declares no immediate ambition to expand out of New York , Gitter\/Anapol plans to introduce the postcards in Los Angeles in September and Chicago by the end of the year .
`` We consider restaurants our editorial environments , '' says Sylvie Anapol , president of Gitter\/Anapol , which also publishes a late-night guide to New York .
`` We choose restaurants carefully in terms of clientele and ambiance .
'' She says the company is circulating 400,000 cards a month and charges $ 1,500 a month for every 20,000 cards .
Five Finger charges $ 1,200 for every 20,000 .
The fees cover printing and distribution ; art is provided by the advertiser .
While the two companies say they have n't had any trouble attracting advertisers , their success rides on their ability to put their racks in the hot spots of the moment .
And already , the two start-ups are butting heads in their quest for new `` editorial environments .
'' A few weeks ago , Vincent Boitier found himself caught in the crossfire .
The manager of Provence , a French restaurant in New York 's trendy Soho district , says he did n't realize he had accepted racks from two different companies , both of which approached him within days of each other .
When the representative from Gitter\/Anapol saw the Five Finger rack , he scolded Mr. Boitier and promptly removed it from the premises .
The Five Finger representative returned to see his rack missing , and asked Mr. Boitier to put another one up .
Now the dueling racks are facing each other in a little hallway leading to Provence 's restrooms .
Mr. Boitier says Gitter\/Anapol , which had promised to include an ad for his restaurant in its guide in exchange for the rack , is now threatening to pull Provence from its pages .
`` They got mad because they wanted an exclusive thing , '' he says .
`` I said fine , do n't put me in the guide .
'' Gitter\/Anapol declined to comment .
Mr. Boitier says he does n't understand what all the fuss is about anyway .
`` People do n't really use '' the postcards , he says .
`` They leave them on the table .

WASHINGTON -- Reversing a stinging defeat for President Clinton , the House approved the most comprehensive anticrime legislation in the nation 's history .
The $ 30.2 billion measure , sent to the Senate by a 235-195 vote , provides for a variety of crime-prevention programs , more police , tougher sentences and more prison cells .
Ten days earlier , the House voted 225-210 against considering a measure with a 10 % higher price tag .
This time , more moderate Republicans joined a majority of Democrats to defeat procedural attempts to stymie it and then voted for the bill itself .
But the victory did n't come easily , as the White House marched steadily to the right to gain votes among conservatives .
Initially , the Clinton administration adopted a fight , fight , fight posture that focused on securing the eight votes it needed to win consideration of the measure .
That strategy never included offering substantive changes to the Democrats ' liberal wing ; instead , Mr. Clinton appealed to their party loyalty and managed to win over just three vote changes from members of the Congressional Black Caucus .
In the final vote , 188 Democrats favored the bill , along with 46 Republicans and one independent .
Opposed were 64 Democrats and 131 Republicans .
The procedural motion allowing debate on the bill passed with nearly the same Democratic total as before except for the three Black Caucus members .
But 42 Republicans voted with the president , up from 11 last time , demonstrating the success of the administration 's move to the right .
The House also rejected a second procedural motion designed to pave the way for a crime measure more conservative than the one that passed .
Now the legislation moves to the Senate , where a vote is likely this week .
Passage is expected , but Senate Republicans , as do many of their colleagues in the House , object to even the reduced crime-prevention expenditures .
They have threatened to use Senate procedural moves to again block consideration .
Despite President Clinton 's moves to make the bill more acceptable to conservatives , he did n't get much respect from some Republicans .
Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner -LRB- R. , Wis. -RRB- said the bill passed because Mr. Clinton is `` the cave-in kid .
'' Mr. Clinton certainly saw it differently .
At a news conference immediately following the House vote , he praised his administration for not succumbing to GOP pressure to remove an assault-weapons ban from the bill .
`` We held firm though the opposition was intense , '' he said , `` and the outcome was uncertain .
'' Rep. John Lewis -LRB- D. , Ga. -RRB- , one of the three Democrats who switched positions on the vote to consider the bill , said the president had no real choice but to seek conservative support .
`` When you move to the left , '' he said , `` you only have a small pool to deal with .
'' A key figure in the effort to secure greater GOP support was Rep. Michael Castle , a first-term Republican from Delaware .
While it 's unusual for a freshman member to take such a leading role in high-profile legislation , his prominence was indicative of the perplexing nature of the crime-bill debate .
Mr. Castle , who worked closely with Mr. Clinton on welfare reform when they both were governors , was an architect of the plan to cut the ill-fated legislation by 10 % .
The new crime bill cuts $ 3.3 billion from the measure that was blocked by an unusual coalition of Republicans , gun-control and death-penalty opponents 10 days earlier with a 225-210 vote .
Within the new $ 30.2 billion bill , $ 23.3 billion is allocated for law enforcement and prisons and $ 6.9 billion is for prevention .
Entire funding for the bill would come from a Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund , financed by the previously planned elimination of 270,000 federal jobs .
The size of the trust fund did n't change ; the $ 3.3 billion reduction was the amount that would have been funded by general Treasury funds .
As with the earlier version , the crime bill now provides partial funding for 100,000 police officers , adds more than 60 federal crimes subject to capital punishment and mandates life sentences for those convicted of three violent felonies -- the so-called `` three strikes and you 're out '' provision -- and allows for juveniles as young as 13 years old to be tried as adults for certain violent federal offenses .
Indicative of the conservative thrust the measure took since it was blocked , two-thirds of the cuts come from crime-prevention programs strongly favored by the Congressional Black Caucus and other Democratic liberals .
As before , however , just how much is authorized for prevention depends on who is counting .
The $ 6.9 billion figure includes , for example , $ 1 billion to apprehend and prosecute attackers of women and $ 1.3 billion for drug courts , which would offer a variety of services for first-time , nonviolent drug offenders , but only after they committed a drug crime .
The prevention program was enough to draw support from strong opponents of the expanded list of crimes qualifying for the death penalty , such as Rep. Don Edwards -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- .
`` For the first time we have a preventive program , and my colleagues , they will work , '' Mr. Edwards said .
Changes in the Bill Included in the new bill are changes that would : -- Require notification when a convicted `` sexual predator '' is released into a community ; sex offenders would have to report their address for life rather than for 10 years , and verify their addresses quarterly rather than annually .
-- Permit evidence of prior sexual and child-molestation offenses to be used against defendants in federal criminal trials , unless Congress acted to reverse this provision within 10 months .
-- Narrow the retroactivity of a provision allowing the early release of nonviolent drug convicts serving a mandatory minimum sentence .
-- Eliminate a $ 10 million authorization for a criminal-justice research center at the hometown alma mater of Rep. Jack Brooks , the Texas Democrat who heads the House Judiciary Committee .
The compromise was reached after exhaustive , sometimes around-the-clock negotiations involving the Clinton administration , House Democratic leaders and various groups of House Republicans .
After it became clear during a White House meeting Thursday night that President Clinton would accept a 10 % cut in the measure , the final stage of negotiations began Friday afternoon and continued until dawn Saturday .
Weary , but determined , members resumed talking Saturday afternoon and kept at it until almost 3 a.m. Sunday , when agreement finally was reached in the House-Senate conference committee that must resolve differences between the crime legislation passed by both chambers .
Despite all the storm over the crime bill , the legislation is only an authorization bill , and much of the spending is subject in the future to annual appropriations bills .
Ironically enough , Congress has already gone ahead and appropriated monies for many of the programs for the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 without waiting for the crime legislation .
Armstrong World Industries Inc. said a federal court jury in New Jersey rejected antitrust claims against the company in a lengthy second trial of a suit brought by Industry Network Systems Inc. .
Armstrong said the decision brings to a close a dispute first filed in 1984 by Industry Network Systems , a now-defunct Paramus , N.J. , publisher of video magazines , and Industry Network founder , Elliot Fineman .
The suit had alleged that Armstrong , a floor-covering and home-furnishings maker based in Lancaster , Pa. , interfered with Industry Network 's attempts to sell independent distributors videos about the floor-covering industry .
Armstrong has denied the charges .
In 1991 , a federal judge threw out a $ 238 million jury award to Industry Network and called for a second trial , declaring that the verdict was n't supported by the weight of the evidence .
The second trial began in April this year .
The company said the decision `` clearly vindicates '' it and its employees .
Attorneys for the plaintiffs could n't be reached for comment .
Ford-Werke AG , the German division of Ford Motor Co. , said first-half pretax earnings more than doubled , and said it will swing to a profit for the full year , following losses in 1992 and 1993 .
Ford-Werke 's six-month pretax profit surged to 250 million marks -LRB- $ 162.1 million -RRB- from a year-earlier 97 million marks .
`` With the concentrated , continued improvement in the cost structure , Ford-Werke AG is confident it will reach a profit for the full year , '' the division 's chairman , Albert Caspers , said at the annual shareholders ' meeting Friday .
That would follow a 132-million-mark loss in 1993 and a 469-million-mark loss in 1992 .
First-half sales jumped 11 % , to 12.76 billion marks -LRB- $ 8.27 billion -RRB- from a year-earlier 11.48 billion marks .
Output at the company 's plants rose 15 % , to 526,000 vehicles from 458,000 a year earlier .
The share price of Dutch aerospace group Fokker NV dropped 7.14 % in the first hour of trading on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange Friday after the company announced bigger-than-expected first-half losses Thursday after the market closed .
At 0815 GMT , Fokker shares had dropped 1.60 guilders -LRB- 92.368 cents -RRB- to stand at 15.20 guilders after closing flat Thursday .
By 0825 GMT , however , the share price stood at 15.60 guilders , down 1.20 guilders from the previous close .
The shares closed at 15.90 guilders .
Fokker , 51 % - controlled by Deutsche Aerospace AG , reported first-half losses widened to 196 million guilders -LRB- $ 113.2 million -RRB- from 127 million guilders .
LONDON -- The chief executive of Vickers PLC said he expects the United Kingdom engineering and motor group to meet market expectations for 1994 pretax profit of # 42.5 million -LRB- $ 65.9 million -RRB- and predicted sales for the year would increase about 8 % .
In an interview , Sir Colin Chandler also said the group , which owns Rolls Royce Motor Cars , has been in `` tentative discussions '' with `` would-be partners , '' principally over engines for future Rolls Royce and Bentley motor cars .
He said talks were being held with Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler-Benz AG 's Mercedes-Benz of Germany as well as Ford Motor Co. and , to a lesser extent , General Motors Corp. of the U.S. He said the company `` ca n't go on forever without a new model '' of Rolls Royce and Bentley but ca n't develop it alone .
If Vickers decided to use engines from another company , it would adapt the engineering for use in the cars .
`` We must be very careful not to dilute the image of our motor cars among our customers , '' said Sir Colin .
The company already uses GM gearboxes , BMW airbags and a Japanese air-conditioning system .
Sir Colin said the company 's markets this year so far had been `` patchy '' with most of the projected gain for the year coming from measures such as rationalization , restructuring and cost-cutting , rather than improved sales volumes .
In 1993 , Vickers had a pretax profit of # 32.3 million , compared with a # 36.6 million loss the year before .
Turnover in 1993 was # 689.6 million , down from sales of # 718.5 million in 1992 .
For 1994 , Sir Colin said `` we will meet market expectations '' for profit for the year , which call for an increase of 31 % , but `` it will be mainly self-help .
'' He added : `` We wo n't see a great increase in turnover , but we will see some -- about 8 % .
'' He did n't estimate half-year figures , which will be announced Sept. 1 .
Sir Colin said the company 's target is for a 10 % profit return on sales , or pretax profit , by the end of 1996 .
He said , `` I think we 're on course for that .
'' Petrolite Corp. said it will record a fiscal fourth-quarter charge of $ 12 million and fire 200 workers .
Petrolite , which supplies chemicals to the oil field industry , said $ 5 million of the charge slated for the quarter ending Oct. 31 will cover severance costs at its U.S. and Canadian operations .
John M. Casper , Petrolite chief financial officer , would n't disclose how many workers it employs in the affected businesses .
The rest of the charge is for the sale of some assets and the closing of facilities , which the company did n't identify .
The company said the charge will result in a loss of undetermined size during the fourth quarter .
In the 1993 fiscal fourth quarter , Petrolite had net income of $ 5.3 million , or 47 cents a share , on revenue of $ 93.1 million .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading , Petrolite closed at $ 31 a share , unchanged .
DALLAS -- CompUSA Inc. , the struggling computer-superstore chain , ousted its chief financial officer , one day after reporting a fiscal fourth-quarter loss .
Mervyn Benjet , who had been executive vice president and chief financial officer since 1991 , also resigned from the board of the Dallas-based retailer .
Both Mr. Benjet and James Halpin , CompUSA 's chief executive and president , declined to comment on the reasons for the move .
Mr. Benjet was asked to resign on Thursday , the day after CompUSA stock fell 17 % on the disappointing earnings .
His departure was announced Friday .
CompUSA closed Friday at $ 7 , unchanged , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Analysts said the move was n't a total surprise since CompUSA has struggled with expense controls .
`` Let 's face it , if the company continues to have problems , one could judge that maybe there needs to be some personnel changes , '' said Dennis Telzrow , research director at Principal Financial Securities Inc. in Dallas .
Mr. Halpin has been engineering an overhaul of senior management and moving to cut costs since taking the reins of the company in December from Nathan Morton , the company 's former chairman and chief executive , who was ousted by the board amid dissatisfaction with the company 's profitability .
Mr. Benjet had been hired by Mr. Morton .
CompUSA has been struggling with high internal costs , a result of past inefficiencies , aggressive expansion and hefty interest payments on $ 110 million in debt .
In addition , heightened competition in the computer-retailing industry has shrunk profit margins , and CompUSA has said its sales have been disappointing as well .
CompUSA named James Skinner , senior vice president-finance and planning , as interim chief financial officer and said a search would be conducted for a successor to Mr. Benjet .
A new board member has n't been named , Mr. Halpin said .
Key Tronic Corp. reported a loss for its fourth quarter , but predicted that it will be profitable for the current fiscal year .
The Spokane , Wash. , maker of computer keyboards said it had a loss of $ 1 million , or 13 cents a share , in the fiscal fourth period ended July 2 , compared with a loss of $ 145,000 , or two cents a share , in the year-earlier period .
Revenue rose to $ 42.7 million from $ 26.9 million .
The company said it has completed a restructuring , and as a result of lower costs and a projected $ 70 million in revenue from new products , it expects to be operating profitably in the fiscal year ending next July .
On the Nasdaq Stock Market Friday , Key Tronic 's shares closed at $ 7.375 , down 37.5 cents .
CEL Communications Inc. , New York , suffering from major losses at its television production division as well as pending litigation , said it filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code .
The diversified media concern said it anticipates filing a plan of reorganization within 90 days and `` hopes to emerge from Chapter 11 before the end of 1994 .
'' The petition was filed in New York on Thursday .
The company had losses of $ 4.9 million , including losses of $ 3.9 million from its television production division , for the year ended March 31 .
The results include writeoffs of $ 1.5 million for its `` Class of the Century '' series and $ 2 million related to the A&E `` Biography '' series .
The company said it reached a preliminary agreement with one of its lenders to provide CEL with post-petition financing .
An application to approve the financing is pending in bankruptcy court , the company said .

KUALA LUMPUR , Malaysia -- United Merchant Group Bhd. may intend to become one of Malaysia 's fastest growing financial concerns , but it forevermore might be noted as the first company targeted for a takeover only one day after its shares were listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange .
On Friday evening , Advance Synergy Bhd. , the corporate flagship of politically well-connected businessman Datuk Ahmad Sebi Bakar , announced a number of complicated cross-transactions that would give the company a controlling stake in United Merchant .
Trading in the shares of Advance Synergy , United Merchant and Hong Leong Credit Bhd. , another company involved in the proposed transactions , was suspended early Friday , soon after news reports outlining the impending takeover maneuvers surfaced .
Heavy trading and sharp price gains on Thursday in United Merchant and Advance Synergy shares triggered speculation about a takeover .
Still , few Malaysian securities analysts anticipated that United Merchant would be up for grabs just after its debut on the Malaysian exchange on Thursday .
Indeed , several analysts questioned whether the company 's controlling shareholders have complied with the exchange 's listing requirements about full disclosure of relevant corporate information prior to the listing .
They also questioned whether the interests of the concern 's minority shareholders were being protected .
`` If all these moves had been in the works before the listing -- as they certainly seem to have been -- should n't the market and all of United Merchant 's shareholders have been informed , '' said a Kuala Lumpur-based analyst .
`` This has got to be the fastest new listing and takeover the exchange has ever seen .
'' -LRB- Indeed , the exchange 's records indicate that it is .
-RRB- A typical requirement for a newly listed company is that its controlling shareholders are obliged to retain their stakes for a specified period of time before they are allowed to divest their shares .
The aim is to protect investors who acquired shares based on the information provided in the listing prospectus , as well as to ensure management continuity and no immediate revamp in a company 's core business .
It was n't immediately clear over the weekend whether United Merchant 's major shareholders had been obligated to adhere to such a requirement or had been given government permission to circumvent customary procedures .
The company 's executives were n't immediately available to comment .
In any event , Malaysia 's Securities Commission and other government regulatory bodies may be under some pressure to closely scrutinize the proposals to determine whether the procedures were followed , said the analysts .
They also noted that the authorities should look into the share-trading activity of the companies involved to determine whether investors were acting on so-called inside information about the impending deals .
Among the announcements released Friday to the Malaysian exchange , Advance Synergy said that its four-stage acquisition of United Merchant began Thursday with the cash purchase of 25 million shares in United Merchant through an undisclosed stockbroking concern for 80 million ringgit -LRB- $ 31.3 million -RRB- , or 3.20 ringgit a share .
That stake , financed through bank borrowings , represents nearly 14 % of United Merchant 's paid-up shares .
The seller was n't identified .
United Merchant was the most heavily traded stock on the Malaysian exchange on Thursday when its shares rocketed from an initial-listing price of 2.75 ringgit to close at 6.85 ringgit .
But the exchange reported on that day that only 21.3 million United Merchant shares had traded hands , far short of the 25 million Advance Synergy said it had acquired .
In addition , Advance Synergy said it signed an agreement to acquire 60 million new United Merchant shares for 192 million ringgit , or 3.20 ringgit a share , from Hong Leong Credit in exchange for 48 million new Advance Synergy shares , valued at four ringgit a share .
The Hong Leong Group , a Malaysian conglomerate , had initially been the sole owner of United Merchant and stands to garner the richest financial windfall from its intricate disposal .
Under its plan , at the end of a complex series of transactions , Advance Synergy would hold a 39 % stake in United Merchant , which obliges the company under the Malaysian exchange 's rules to make a general offer for the remaining United Merchant shares .
But at 3.20 a share -- the price at which Thursday 's purchase and follow-up proposals are based and therefore the price Advance Synergy would be required to offer for each remaining United Merchant share under exchange regulations -- the company is n't likely to get many takers if United Merchant 's share price remains at or goes above its presuspension price of 6.85 ringgit .
During the weekend , several analysts questioned why a United Merchant shareholder or shareholders were willing to divest their stock on Thursday at 3.20 ringgit each when the company 's shares quickly rose above that level to a high of 7.15 ringgit for the day before falling back to 6.85 ringgit .
`` Something does n't look right here , '' said one analyst .
SANTIAGO , Chile -- On the southern tip of the Western Hemisphere , far from the world 's great money centers , a daring experiment in financial reform is coming to fruition .
Fed up with the inefficiency and high cost of the state pension system , Chile took the novel step of privatizing social security .
The World Bank expects at least 30 countries to undertake pension reform over the next few years ; not surprisingly , officials from developing and developed nations are trekking to Chile to see how it was done .
Under the Chilean system , 10 % of every worker 's paycheck is deposited into an individual savings account managed by a private fund of the worker 's choosing .
Today , more than a decade after the program started , the system manages assets of $ 19.22 billion , enough to give Chile a savings rate approaching that of some Asian nations .
At the same time , Chile has all but eliminated the possibility that free-spending politicians will dip into the social-security pool -- a problem not unique to the developing world .
Privatized social security is just one of the innovative economic programs that has emerged out of Latin America in recent years .
`` People all over the world are studying what 's going on here , '' notes Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo .
Policy makers from as far away as Albania have journeyed to Buenos Aires to learn how Argentina tamed hyperinflation , in part by making the local currency fully convertible to the dollar .
Officials from New Delhi to Warsaw have traveled to Mexico City to find out how an official with the unlikely name of Jacques Rogozinski found buyers for $ 23 billion of state-owned companies .
In a year when once-soaring stock markets in Latin America have shown great volatility , the growing influence of the region 's policy makers puts recent setbacks in perspective .
`` What 's been happening in Latin America is more profound than whether emerging markets suffer a bad quarter or two , '' says William Cline , senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics .
Chile 's pension-fund reform is the product of University of Chicago-trained economists who worked for a military government that was privatizing state companies back in the 1970s , before even Margaret Thatcher was doing it .
Jose Pinera , who oversaw the social-security shift in 1981 , knew that drastic action was needed .
Pension and health costs consumed about one-fifth of the federal budget .
With a declining birthrate , fewer contributors were supporting ever more retirees .
`` The only solution was giving the system back to the workers , '' Mr. Pinera says .
Chilean workers ' initial hesitancy to enter the new system was gradually overcome as the private funds churned out returns averaging 14 % a year .
`` I feel much more in control of my future than I did with the state pension system , '' says Ana Vera , a secretary who keeps her statement of account in her purse .
The government 's only role is to regulate the funds and ensure a minimum pension in case that from the privatized fund falls below a subsistence level .
The amount of this liability wo n't be clear for 20 years or so , when contributors to the private funds begin reaching retirement age .
The pool of contributions , now representing about 35 % of Chile 's gross domestic product , has served as the foundation for a vibrant capital market consisting of stocks , bonds and other financial instruments .
Alone among Latin American countries , Chile has avoided a dependence upon the volatile flows of foreign capital that have proved a mixed blessing elsewhere .
Recently , several Latin American nations , including Mexico , Peru , Colombia and Argentina , have adopted variations of the Chilean pension system .
Privatized pensions have their drawbacks , however .
`` I think one should worry about whether other countries would have the same degree of success '' as Chile , says Peter Diamond , a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist .
The authoritarian clout of Chile 's former military government played a key role in building the large budget surplus needed to launch the plan , as well as in enforcing the mandatory worker participation .
Perhaps the biggest problem of private pension funds is their operating cost , which actually exceeds that of state-run social-security systems .
A key reason : the expensive marketing campaigns that the private companies use to attract depositors .
To deal with that problem , Colombia , which allowed creation of private pension funds this year , is keeping one fund in government hands .
It hopes a penny-pinching government manager can prod the competing private funds to control costs .
Despite its flaws , Chile 's system continues to draw interest .
One of the first economic-policy statements from Italy 's new government focused on the need to adopt a social-security system like Chile 's .
Your July 25 editorial , `` Turning Trade Inside Out , '' is rife with misinformation .
First , you should know that the American textile industry , as represented by the American Textile Manufacturers Institute , has not opposed the Uruguay Round on the General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade -LRB- GATT -RRB- .
Moreover , we have been preparing for the 10-year phase out of quotas and significant reduction of tariffs by spending nearly $ 2.5 billion a year for modern machinery that will enable us to be competitive in the global marketplace .
Beyond that , we are now able to focus on exports as a result of the market openings achieved in the Uruguay Round -- markets which had previously been closed to us .
As the implementing legislation of the Uruguay Round relates to rules of origin , it is simple and clear that if goods are assembled in a country then they should bear the label of that country .
To do otherwise would be dishonest to the consumer and would promote mislabeling and illegal transshipment .
With regard to the allegation that requiring accurate rules of origin enforcement would incur additional costs to the consumer : If rules of origin require goods to actually be made in Hong Kong , and if Hong Kong can not produce these goods competitively , then importers can turn to Nafta : U.S. and Canadian textile products can be cost-efficiently sewn in Mexico for sale in the U.S. The short interest ratio is the number of days it would take to cover the short interest if trading continued at the average daily volume for the month .
STUTTGART , Germany -- Mercedes-Benz AG said Friday it is conducting a preliminary feasibility study on vehicle production in Russia .

The purchase prices are subject to potential adjustment , Arch said .
The Westborough , Mass. , company declined to disclose details of the separate pacts .
Becker is based in Chicago and Abraham is based in Tampa , Fla. .
The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close this fall .
There are 7.1 million Arch shares outstanding .
Arch had 367,000 paging units in service as of May 31 .
Gambro AB , a Swedish medical-technology group , said pretax profit rose 18 % , to 582 million kronor -LRB- $ 75 million -RRB- , in the first half from a year-earlier 495 million kronor .
Sales rose 13 % , to 4.89 billion kronor from 4.33 billion kronor in the year-earlier six months .
Gambro benefited from strong sales in renal care , its largest single business area .
Renal care contributed 3.17 billion kronor to group sales in the first half , up from a year-earlier 2.91 billion kronor .
Stronger sales were also noted in the group 's cardiovascular-surgery business , and in blood components .
Sales in anesthesia were lower .
The company did n't specify a full-year forecast but said `` earnings are expected to continue to develop favorably during the remainder of 1994 .
'' The Journal 's Aug. 3 editorial opposing the confirmation of Third Circuit appointee H. Lee Sarokin -LRB- `` One Man 's Ambrosia '' -RRB- is just as misguided as the liberal and Democratic opposition to the confirmation of Robert H. Bork was seven years ago .
Both focus nearly exclusively on a few rhetorical flourishes that may appear extreme but ignore the vast corpus of actual decisions and opinions which show a far more moderate and centrist judge .
The opposition has given central attention to rhetoric in a small set of Judge Sarokin 's opinions ignoring both the narrow and careful rulings in those cited opinions , as well as the broader corpus of decisions of Judge Sarokin 's 15-year career that show him to be impartial , moderate and easily within the range that the American public could expect from its 1992 election of Bill Clinton .
For example , your editorial criticized Judge Sarokin 's dictim in the Kreimer case -LRB- a ruling on a homeless person barred from entering the Morristown , N.J. , library -RRB- that `` we should revoke their -LCB- the homeless -RCB- condition and not their library cards .
'' This is effective rhetoric , but it had nothing to do with the decision in the case , whose narrow issue was whether the library 's prohibition against persons whose bodily hygiene was offensive was excessively vague .
The criticism of Judge Sarokin in the Haines cigarette litigation is similarly misplaced .
After reviewing in camera scores of secret cigarette company files , Judge Sarokin used strong language about the underlying morality of the cigarette company 's concealment .
The narrow issue in the case , however , involved the application of the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege .
The more important point is that the rhetoric , whether celebrated or criticized , is misdescriptive of the narrow grounds of the decision .
As with Judge Bork , the focus on the rhetoric in these few cases neglects the corpus of Judge Sarokin 's opinions .
For example , there has been little attention to Judge Sarokin 's 1989 opinion in Juzwin v. Amtorg Trading Corp. in which Judge Sarokin bravely ruled that multiple awards of punitive damages against manufacturers engaged in a single course of conduct were counterproductive , harmed , rather than helped , consumers and the society , and violated the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment .
Conservatives -LRB- and the Journal -RRB- have been struggling to convince the Supreme Court of this general point for many years .
Like Robert Bork , Lee Sarokin is a brilliant writer and a stylist .
But also like Robert Bork , Lee Sarokin 's record as a judge shows basic fairness , impartiality and great wisdom .
Lee Sarokin will prove an excellent addition to the Third Circuit , and the Senate should confirm him .
Already a favorite of the investment community , Lufthansa helped prospects for its coming share issue by announcing it swung back to profit in the first half for the first time in five years and expected to resume paying a dividend .
The German airline confirmed its chairman 's previous forecast by reporting a pretax profit for the first half of 105 million marks -LRB- $ 68.1 million -RRB- .
That compares with a pretax loss of 221 million marks in the year-earlier period .
It was the first time the airline reported a first-half profit since 1989 .
Although expected , the airline 's results come as good news to an investment community awaiting Lufthansa 's share issue .
The airline is planning to raise about $ 1.2 billion through a rights issue that will result in the state 's ownership dropping below the 51 % level .
By the end of next year , the government expects to sell off its remaining shares and leave Lufthansa entirely in the ownership of private shareholders .
The results are also welcome in an industry battered by several years of recession .
Lufthansa 's positive results confirmed a recent trend among what analysts call Europe 's market-oriented airlines .
British Airways , KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines system have all recently reported positive earnings results .
Other airlines , however , still are struggling to return to profit even if a European recovery is expected to boost their fortunes .
For example , Air France , which takes Lufthansa as its model for reorganization , is n't expected to return to profit for at least another year .
In recent months , Lufthansa has gained the favor of nearly every analyst following the company .
Their enthusiasm for an airline once derided as being ignorant of the word `` cost '' is based on several things : The company 's cost-cutting efforts , its partnership with powerful United Airlines of the U.S. , the recovery of business traffic in Europe and the privatization plans .
`` They 've made great strides forward in the last year and a half , and I expect that to continue , '' said Eve Poluha of DB Research in Frankfurt .
In fact , the wellspring of enthusiasm among analysts is so strong that it prompted Klaus Roepke of James Capel Europe to comment : `` That may be the only weakness '' for the stock .
Lufthansa 's results were particularly strong in the second quarter , when it posted a pretax profit of 187 million marks compared with a pretax profit of 24 million marks in the year-earlier period .
The airline reported its overall traffic rose 10.9 % while its capacity rose only 8.6 % .
That helped fill the airline 's cabins and cargo bays , allowing them to fly with 68.8 % of their capacity used .
On the cost side , Lufthansa said its labor costs fell 4 % compared with a year earlier .
At the end of June , the airline 's employment stood at 44,978 , down 7.8 % from a year earlier .
This helped the airline report a 17.8 % rise in productivity .
Lufthansa also noted that its fuel costs fell despite a 7.5 % rise in the number of flights during the period .
Fees for air traffic control , airport landing slots and handling rose 6.7 % .
NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve still has n't raised short-term interest rates enough to snuff out inflationary pressures , say money managers and economists .
Since February the Fed has put through increases totaling 1.75 percentage points in the federal-funds rate , which banks charge among themselves for overnight loans .
But the same market participants believe the rate , currently 4.75 % , eventually will have to go up another percentage point .
The good news is that many analysts believe that after Tuesday 's aggressive , half-percentage-point boost , chances are the Fed wo n't move again for as long as three months , depending on how quickly the nation 's economy grows .
The Fed raised by the same amount its discount rate , at which it lends to banks , to 4 % .
Though inflation remains relatively low in the U.S. , there are some signs that inflationary pressures are growing .
On Thursday the bond market plunged on news of a sharp increase in price indexes in a regional economic report from the Philadelphia Fed .
And industrial commodity prices have also been on the rise this year .
What 's more , as Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has pointed out in recent public statements , it 's just as important to reduce investors ' expectations of higher inflation as it is to reduce actual inflation .
So as long as many investors worry that inflation is an imminent threat , the Fed still has work to do to convince them otherwise by raising short-term interest rates .
-LRB- Investors fear rising prices because they reduce the value of investments which provide a fixed rate of return , like bonds .
-RRB- John Lipksy , chief economist at Salomon Brothers , says that the fed-funds rate could rise as much as a full percentage point , to 5.75 % , before June 1995 .
`` We 've got a significant ways to go yet before the tightening move is ended , '' Mr. Lipsky says .
`` The fed-funds rate is near its historical average , which is only about two percentage points higher than inflation , '' he adds .
More increases `` will be needed before economic growth will decelerate to a sustainable level '' with low inflation .
It appears that many investors agree with that assessment , both in the U.S. and abroad .
On Friday , for example , the three-month Eurodollar currency futures contract , a popular measure of foreigners ' sentiment , showed that non-U.S. investors were expecting a fed-funds rate of about 5.25 % by December and about 5.5 % by March 1995 .
A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a set time in the future at an agreed-upon price .
The contract tends to be a bit exaggerated , analysts say , but it is considered a good measure of the direction of interest rates .
Such a high implied fed-funds rate , just three days after a very aggressive move by the Fed to push up rates , shows how worried foreign investors are about the U. SS bond markets .
A measure of U.S. investor expectations for short-term interest rates is the 30-day fed-funds futures contract traded on the Chicago Board of Trade .
On Friday the fed-funds contract , which is less traded than the Eurodollar contract , indicated a rate of just over 5.25 % by December and just over 5.6 % by March 1995 .
But a rising fed-funds rate does n't necessarily mean similarly large increases in long-term interest rates , analysts say .
Mr. Lipsky at Salomon says that he expects 30-year bond yields `` significantly above 7.5 % '' before the end of this year , but not above 8 % .
On Friday the 30-year bond yielded 7.49 % , very close to where it started the week before the Fed raised interest rates .
Since May the yield of the 30-year bond has oscillated between roughly 7.25 % and 7.75 % .
Still , he says , there are n't as yet any `` broad-based signs '' of a major slowdown in the economy .
Income and consumption continue to be robust , he explains ; `` That is why the early warning signs of inflation need to be taken seriously .
'' John Lonski , senior economist at Moody 's Investors Service , says that the last time the Fed ended a tightening cycle , in February 1989 , was at the point where there was a `` peaking of capacity utilization and a bottoming of the unemployment rate .
'' According to Mr. Lonski `` there is nothing on the horizon '' that indicates the same thing is going to happen anytime soon .
The two indicators `` are still moving in directions that portend a greater danger of higher inflation rather than a smaller one .
'' In July , capacity utilization stood at 83.9 % , compared with a peak of 84.8 % in March 1989 , at the end of the last interest rate cycle , Mr. Lonski says .
At the same time , the unemployment rate bottomed at 5 % , compared with a rate of 6.1 % for July , he says .
The same month , the monthly average of the fed-funds rate peaked at 9.8 % , he says .
Comparisons between the unemployment rate now and in 1989 may be a bit difficult , due to changes in the way the government measures the work force .
But the size of the gap between the low in 1989 and today 's levels is large enough for Mr. Lonski to remain convinced that the Fed is far from ending its current tightening cycle .
There are other worries for bond investors , like growing economic strength in Europe and the need for central banks there to raise rates to stifle the resulting inflationary pressures .
Terence Prideaux , a director at Kemper Investment Management in London , believes a move by the German Bundesbank to raise rates sharply could hurt the value of the U.S. dollar and , in turn , the attractiveness of U.S. Treasurys .
`` There has been a change in people 's attitudes about what the Bundesbank might do next , '' Mr. Prideaux says .
`` They might not lower rates ; the next move may be up .
'' Weakness in the dollar against the Japanese yen and the German mark was another factor helping send bond prices more than a point lower last Thursday .
A weak dollar reduces demand by foreign investors for dollar-denominated securities .
There is one sign that some investors are growing more bearish on long-term interest rates : Last week there were reports that many money managers were starting to make a bet on what is called a yield-curve steepening .
In this case , many of these managers , including hedge funds , are shorting 30-year Treasury bonds and snapping up two-year notes .
An investor sets up a short position by borrowing bonds and selling them with hopes of buying them back at a lower price and pocketing the difference .
This bet pays big if long-term rates rise more quickly , as their prices fall , than short-term rates , thus widening the yield gap -- or steepening the yield curve -- between two-year notes and 30-year bonds .
If the size of the yield gap between the two maturities remains unchanged , even as rates rise or fall , this type of position can still be profitable .
James Somers , a hedge-fund manager in Radnor , Pa. , says that the fact that more managers are making curve-steepening trades may not necessarily be a bearish sign , since the trade also pays well if long-term rates rise or fall at the same speed as short-term rates .
But he conceded that a shift toward trades that anticipate a steepening of the curve -- and away from curve-flattening trades -LRB- where investors bet on falling long-term rates and rising short-term rates -RRB- -- indicates a growing bearish outlook toward long-term interest rates .
After a tumultuous week , the bond market coasted into the weekend .
Prices of U.S. Treasury securities finished a seesaw session little changed .
The battered dollar was the chief influence on trading early in the day .
But the dollar stabilized , and Treasury prices were able to finish barely changed .
The price of the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond dropped 1\/32 to 100 3\/32 .
The yield finished at 7.49 % .
The bond market 's attention is now fixed on the next round of new issuance from the government .
The Treasury Department will be selling $ 17.25 billion in two-year notes tomorrow and $ 11.0 billion in five-year notes Wednesday .
Meanwhile , ratings downgrades put the junk bonds of Revlon Consumer Products , Revlon Worldwide and Belle Casinos under pressure Friday .
The prices of bonds issued by Revlon Consumer Products and Revlon Worldwide dropped Friday morning after Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group revised its outlook on the companies to negative from stable .
S&P affirmed Revlon Consumer Products ' senior unsecured debt at single-B , as well as Revlon Worldwide 's senior secured debt at single-B-minus .
Revlon Consumer Products 9 3\/8 % coupon debt due 2001 dropped two points , or $ 20 for a bond with $ 1,000 face value , to 83 during the session .
Some of Revlon Worldwide 's bonds dropped even more .
`` Revlon 's outlook change reflects disappointing operating performance since the 1993 refinancings and substantially slower-than-anticipated improvement from their restructuring , '' S&P said in a statement .
Revlon Worldwide is owned by MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings and owns 100 % of the equity of Revlon Consumer Products .
MacAndrews is owned by New York investor Ronald Perelman .
Moody 's Investors Service said it downgraded Belle Casinos ' $ 75 million issue of first mortgage notes maturing in 2006 to single-B-3 from single-B-2 and kept them under review for possible further downgrade .
`` The downgrade reflects its concerns about the issuer 's future ability to meet its interest payments even if it is able to complete the financial restructure it is currently seeking to negotiate , '' Moody 's said .
If a financial restructure agreement is n't achieved , it is highly likely that Belle will default on its Oct. 15 interest payment , Moody 's added .
Belle Casinos is a Mississippi riverboat gambling operator .
Traders said they did n't see activity in the illiquid issue , which was sold October 1993 .
But all agreed the bonds would eventually be quoted down significantly .

PepsiCo Inc. formed a joint venture Friday to produce soft drink products in Changchun , in China 's Jilin province , with an initial investment of $ 20 million .
The venture , Changchun Pepsi-Cola Beverage Co. , is jointly owned by Pepsi , Changchun No. 2 Food Factory and Beijing Chong Yin Industry & Trade Co. .
It will target Changchun and northern China , producing Pepsi-Cola , 7-Up , Mirinda and other soft drinks with annual capacity expected at 10 million cases within one to two years .
`` We are dedicated to assisting the development of the country 's beverage industry and have , to date , committed over $ 450 million to China , '' said Miguel Ko , president of Pepsi-Cola Asia Pacific .
Currently , PepsiCo , of Purchase , N.Y. , has 13 joint-venture operations in the mainland .
It plans to build another nine plants over the next five years .
The wireless-communications sector is sending mixed signals to investors .
While some companies that operate cellular telephone and paging networks are basking in the glow of stock prices at 52-week highs , others are struggling with plunging prices .
The problem , say analysts , is that reality has finally set in for what had been a badly overheated group of stocks .
`` There was a mania last fall , '' says Charles Pluckhahn , a portfolio manager specializing in small-cap growth stocks at State Street Research , in Boston .
Mr. Pluckhahn says low interest rates made the long-term cash flow projections of the wireless industry look especially attractive .
Couple that with a flurry of mergers and investors were falling all over themselves pushing money at the stocks .
But today merger activity in wireless companies is down while interest rates are up .
What 's more , a few companies have n't met their cash flow expectations .
As a result , `` the mania has ended and a lot of these stocks have fallen back , '' says Mr. Pluckhahn .
The cheap prices of some wireless stocks could be alluring .
But analysts warn investors to be wary .
If a company 's prospects sound too good to be true , they probably are .
`` In the wireless-telecommunications industry , there is an enormous amount of hyperbole centering on magical technologies which can never be developed in the time frame suggested , '' cautions Herschel Shosteck , an independent telecommunications consultant in Silver Spring , Md. .
Mr. Shosteck is reluctant to even suggest names of possible investments .
Other experts are less hesitant .
Frederick W. Moran , a wireless analyst with Salomon Brothers , likes Centennial Cellular and U.S. Cellular , both of which operate networks in rural areas .
Some analysts wo n't endorse rural cellular operators , because those companies depend on high `` roaming '' fees for calls placed from outside their immediate areas .
But Mr. Moran calls such concerns `` overblown .
'' While he acknowledges that prices for roaming calls will eventually drop , he is confident an increase in call volume will more than make up the difference .
Both Centennial Cellular and U.S. Cellular have suffered lower-than-expected cash flow as a result of the development of rural networks .
Centennial 's stock has fallen to $ 16 a share from a high of near $ 24 and U.S. Cellular has fallen to just under $ 29 from a high of near $ 40 .
If , as Mr. Moran expects , cash flow at both companies improves markedly in the coming year , the stock prices will show sharp gains .
He 's looking for Centennial to regain its $ 24-a-share high and says U.S. Cellular has a shot at breaking the $ 40-a-share mark .
While U.S. Cellular has a market capitalization of $ 2.4 billion , Mr. Moran says it trades like a small-cap stock because it is 80 % - owned by Telephone & Data Systems .
On the paging side , Mr. Moran advocates American Paging , which went public in January at $ 14 a share .
Since then , weak cash flow has halved the stock 's price .
But if paging contract subscriptions continue to post 40 % annual gains , the stock could easily regain its issue price , he says .
It is `` clearly the cheapest play '' among wireless firms , Mr. Moran adds .
Whatever happens to companies that operate cellular and paging networks , some experts think firms that manufacture wireless equipment will benefit from a growing market .
Jeffrey L. Hines , a senior wireless analyst at PaineWebber , likes Teknekron Communications Systems and Allen Group .
Teknekron is working with AT&T , Texas Instruments and Oki to develop new methods of encoding voices for digital wireless transmission .
Mr. Hines estimates that the company 's earnings will hit 40 cents a share this year , and 50 cents in 1995 .
He thinks its stock , which closed Friday at $ 6.625 , down 37.5 cents , in Nasdaq Stock Market trading , could move into the low double-digits .
Mr. Hines believes Allen will see earnings of $ 1 a share this year and $ 1.50 or more in 1995 .
The company makes antennas and other components for wireless telephone and radio communications .
He looks for its stock , which was unchanged Friday at $ 17 on the New York Stock Exchange , to hit $ 25 or $ 30 in a year .
Smaller stocks edged higher with price movement restrained in a monthly options expirations session .
Technology stocks seesawed Friday morning as profit-takers descended on the group .
By midday , prices in the sector were about flat , but some software stocks surged on individual company news .
Advancing Nasdaq issues outran decliners 1,650-1 ,461 , on Nasdaq total volume of 282,980,000 , compared with a total of 335,285,000 the previous day .
For the week , the Russell 2000 gained 2.58 points , or 1.04 % and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.81 points , or 1.48 % .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 13.6 points , or 0.36 % .

In defending Christina Hoff Sommers ' baseless criticisms of research commissioned by the American Association of University Women , Melanie Kirkpatrick is not taking feminism back , but rather setting it back -LRB- `` Taking Feminism Back , '' Bookshelf , July 14 -RRB- .
Despite all the overheated rhetoric about a gender war in Ms. Sommers ' book and Ms. Kirkpatrick 's column , the only battle going on is in their imaginations .
Had Ms. Kirkpatrick bothered to check the facts , she would have found that Ms. Sommers ' criticisms of the self-esteem poll and `` The AAUW Report : How Schools Shortchange Girls '' were unfounded and reveal shoddy scholarship and an ignorance of basic polling methodology .
Contrary to what Ms. Sommers would have her readers believe , no conclusions in the self-esteem poll were drawn simply from one or two questions .
Rather , the analysis was complex and relied on a variety of methodologies which examined multiple patterns across multiple indicators for repeated conclusions .
The data holds up and all conclusions were approved by a team of academic advisers .
As for the absurd charge that AAUW 's research disparages analytical thinking and civics classes , if Ms. Kirkpatrick had been a little less blindly accepting of Ms. Sommers ' book , she would have discovered that claim to be a gross mischaracterization .
One study out of the 1,331 studies reviewed in the AAUW Report calls for a more diverse and inclusive curriculum that allows students to use BOTH their vertical and lateral thinking skills .
AAUW sponsors math camps , mentoring programs and science fairs .
We award $ 2.75 million in grants and fellowships to women completing their dissertations and conducting thesis research .
And the majority of the AAUW fellowships are given to women employing `` vertical '' thinking to do so-called `` boy 's work , '' such as engineering , astronomy and mathematics .
So while Ms. Sommers spins her tales to sell her book , AAUW will continue to focus on solutions to remedy subtle yet pervasive gender bias in America 's schools .
The evidence is in and the picture is clear : Shortchanging girls -- the women of tomorrow -- shortchanges America .
And that 's a fact .
In his Aug. 5 column , `` On Whitewater : Clinton Team Does n't Inhale , '' Paul Gigot left the impression that Ricki Tigert , the Clinton administration 's nominee to chair the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -LRB- FDIC -RRB- , has not agreed to recuse herself from Whitewater matters if she were confirmed by the Senate .
In his column Mr. Gigot wrote : `` On Feb. 1 Ms. Tigert told the Senate she would n't recuse herself from Whitewater matters ; we now know that was the same week the White House leaned on Mr. Altman not to recuse .
'' This is a clever juxtaposition of unrelated events , but it leaves the false impression that Ms. Tigert 's position and Mr. Altman 's were somehow connected .
In reality , a few days after her confirmation hearing and prior to the Senate Banking Committee 's vote , Ms. Tigert advised the Senate Banking Committee in writing that she would recuse herself from any investigation , inquiry , or determination concerning President or Mrs. Clinton .
The committee then approved her nomination , 18 to 1 .
We know from our discussions with Ms. Tigert during the confirmation process that she never sought or received advice from any White House official on the decision to recuse herself .
Instead , she followed her own counsel and advised the Deputy White House Counsel that this was her decision .
There was no effort to dissuade her .
And she was unaware at the time of any controversy within the White House concerning Roger Altman .
Further , we strongly disagree with the suggestion in your editorial , `` The Meese Test , '' of July 20 , that Ms. Tigert would be a `` bank regulator\/crony .
'' We have all known Ms. Tigert for at least a decade , and have worked with her closely in her government service and private law practice .
Two of us worked with her in the Reagan administration .
She has had a distinguished career and is held in high esteem as an internationally recognized expert in banking law and regulation .
She is committed to the complete independence and integrity of the bank regulatory process , as she testified in her confirmation hearing .
The notion that she is a Clinton `` crony '' is a canard .
She has met the Clintons , but only in public .
She has never spent time alone with either of them .
We believe the Senate and House should diligently pursue Whitewater , but Ms. Tigert 's nomination to chair the FDIC is a completely unrelated matter .
Continuing to hold up a vote on her nomination does nobody any good -- least of all the banking industry .
She deserves to have her nomination considered by the full Senate , and she deserves to be confirmed .
Fuji Photo Film Co. and the U.S. Commerce Department signed final agreements requiring the Japanese company to raise U.S. prices on its color photographic paper in return for the Commerce Department 's not demanding import duties .
The agreements , which were expected , already are benefiting Fuji competitors , as many paper customers now are scrambling to find lower-priced alternatives .
Among them are Eastman Kodak Co. , Konica Corp. and Bayer AG 's Agfa unit .
Kodak triggered the price boost by charging Fuji last year with illegal dumping -- selling color photographic paper in the U.S. for less than it does in Japan and the Netherlands .
During the past decade Tokyo-based Fuji has won about 20 % of the U.S. color-paper market , threatening Kodak , which once supplied paper to nearly all U.S. photofinishers .
Under the agreement , the Commerce Department will determine the `` foreign market value '' of the paper -- a price at or above which Fuji must sell its paper .
That price will be determined quarterly by cost-of-production figures from Japan and the Netherlands , although only the Netherlands matters for Fuji because that is where it makes all its U.S. paper .
People close to the agreement said that this foreign-market-value price will be about 30 cents per square foot , roughly 10 cents higher than giant retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. pay and at least several cents more than midlevel customers such Moto Photo Inc. pay .
It 's unclear what deals Kodak and competitors can offer , but they are free to sell at prices below Fuji .
Kodak says Fuji has used profits in Japan to `` underwrite the costs of dumping these products in the U.S. at artificially low prices .
'' Already Fuji 's biggest mail order customer Nashua Corp. , an estimated $ 14 million account , has switched its U.S. business to Kodak .
Wal-Mart said Friday it is `` waiting for bids from other paper suppliers .
'' Other big Fuji customers such as Moto Foto and Genovese Drug Stores Inc. said last week they too are `` looking at other options .
'' What 's more , Fuji 's own wholesale photofinishing labs , TruColor Inc. , probably will switch to another supplier 's paper because of cost , people close to the company say .
Wholesale labs service big retailers such as Kmart Corp. .
Fuji said the agreements were n't an admission of dumping , adding that it signed them to resolve the case , which had `` required considerable manpower and financial resources .
'' Industry observers said Fuji 's best strategy now is to recapture lost customers after it finishes building a $ 250 million paper plant in Greenwood , S.C. , which will make Fuji a domestic producer and not subject to U.S. pricing rules .
Some photofinishers worried that Friday 's agreement stilted competition .
`` Kodak simply has not had a serious competitor until Fuji , '' said Wayne Haub , president of Raytown , Mo.-based H&H Color Lab , which switched to Fuji paper from Kodak in 1991 .
`` We have no intention of switching back , even with the price increase .
'' The five-year agreements cover color paper and chemical components from Japan and the Netherlands .
Konica is also affected because it ships chemical components from Japan to make paper in the U.S. Fuji or Kodak can still decide to ask the U.S. International Trade Commission for a final ruling on whether there was material injury or threat of material injury to Kodak .
If the ITC were to find in Fuji 's favor , the suspension agreements would become moot and Fuji could continue selling its paper at whatever price .
HONG KONG -- Macao 's merchandise trade deficit narrowed 8.5 % to 1.5 billion patacas -LRB- $ 188.3 million -RRB- in the first half of 1994 from 1.64 billion patacas in the yearearlier period , the government said .
According to Portugal 's LUSA News Agency , the enclave 's export value between January and June rose 5.5 % to 6.5 billion patacas .
Import value during the same period increased by 2.9 % to eight billion patacas .
Textile and garment exports accounted for 70 % of Macao 's total export value , but grew only 0.7 % in the first half of 1994 when compared with the same period last year .
Macao , a Portuguese enclave 37 miles west of Hong Kong , reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1999 .
The future looks bright through a pair of Kopin Corp. 's virtual-reality goggles .
But getting from prototype to volume production is proving tougher than expected .
Westborough , Mass.-based Kopin has demonstrated leading-edge technology in flat-panel computer displays , a fast-growing $ 5 billion-a-year market now dominated by Japan .
It has won $ 20 million in contracts from the Pentagon , and its research in solid-state imaging devices also has potential uses in the consumer electronics , medical and entertainment industries .
`` It 's a concept stock that 's captured people 's imagination , '' says Byron Walker , an analyst at Needham & Co. , one of Kopin 's two underwriters , which has a `` buy '' rating on the stock .
But Mr. Walker is surprisingly critical of Kopin 's progress in crossing over from research start-up to commercial manufacturer , a chasm that swallows many promising companies .
`` Kopin has gotten way ahead of itself , '' he says .
`` They ` ve grossly underestimated the difficulty of largescale commercial production .
'' Kopin 's stock price got pummeled between October and June , as the market for small high-tech stocks turned sour and analysts slashed earnings estimates for Kopin .
But the stock has bounced back by 57 % from its July low of 11 , and its market value now tops $ 160 million .
It closed at 17 1\/4 , up 1\/4 , Friday on the Nasdaq Stock Market .
Kopin 's visionary founder and chief executive officer , John C.C. Fan , told analysts earlier this year the company could have $ 30 million in 1994 product revenue , mostly from sales of its Pocket Pro portable display device .
Connected to a standard slide projector , the Pocket Pro can display graphics , text or other output from a laptop personal computer .
It 's supposed to be the first of many products , from virtual-reality headsets to high-definition-television monitors .
`` The technical hurdles have been overcome , '' Dr. Fan says .
`` We have surpassed Japan with the world 's highest-resolution miniature display .
'' Maybe .
But volume Pocket Pro shipments are likely to take longer than Kopin has been telling investors .
The company has retreated from Dr. Fan 's $ 30 million projection .
And color displays -- crucial for the commercial market -- are even further off .
Paul Mitchell , Kopin 's chief financial officer , concedes : `` It 's fair to say this is a difficult manufacturing process , and that the yields -LCB- of usable silicon chips -RCB- so far are not as high as we 'd like them to be .
As we perfect the process , those yields will start to rise significantly .
'' An analyst for Kopin 's other underwriter , Herbert Maher of Hancock Institutional Equity Services , recently cut his 1994 earnings estimate for the fifth time in 14 months , to `` break-even or a modest loss .
'' But he kept a `` buy '' on the stock , predicting that profit will climb to $ 1 a share in 1995 , based on a more-than-fourfold jump in sales to $ 80 million .
On Friday he allowed that $ 1 a share `` may be a little aggressive .
'' Some analysts question whether buyers will want Kopin 's monochrome display .
`` Users are n't going to want to see video or experience virtual reality in black and white , '' says Brian Kritzer of Fechtor Detwiler in Boston .
`` It wo n't sell .
'' Kopin has demonstrated a color model , but volume production is at least a year off , he says .
Kopin has already landed one big order .
Rockwell International , which owns 4 % of Kopin stock , wants 1,200 headset displays , valued at $ 1.4 million , which it will use in a three-pound , speech-activated PC to be worn on the belt .
And the Pentagon remains a supporter .
`` Kopin has some unique technology and has done a fantastic job pulling together a team and delivering product , '' says Dick Urban of the Pentagon 's Advanced Research Projects Agency .
But Kopin has a long way to go in the commercial market .
David Mentley , of market researcher Stanford Resources , notes that giants Texas Instruments and Sharp , plus three smaller firms all have rival display designs .
`` The market is brutally competitive , '' he says .
Some skeptics doubt that Kopin can make the promised leap to commercial sales , and may instead remain a research boutique , supplying exotic technology to the Pentagon and selling the rights to its designs to big companies with proven manufacturing skills .
Investors have bid up the stock in recent days , partly on rumors that Kopin is close to a deal with Philips Electronics , the Dutch electronics giant .
They say Philips is considering building Kopin 's miniature displays into a big-screen-projection TV .
Mr. Mitchell , the chief financial officer , declined to comment on Philips , but did say Kopin `` has been in discussions related to technology and manufacturing collaborations with several potential partners .
'' Year ended Dec. 31 , 1993 : WASHINGTON -- President Clinton said the economy is growing faster than both the Federal Reserve and the administration anticipated and suggested that recent interest-rate increases were necessary to fight inflation .
`` We 've got rapid growth in the economy , dramatic new investments in the private sector , '' Mr. Clinton said at a news conference Friday .
`` We are doing even better than we thought we would .
'' Mr. Clinton also said that his policy of `` letting the Fed do its job ... has worked out very well .
'' However , he added that `` when it is apparent to me that the drag on the economy will be more about slowing the economy down than stopping inflation , I will do what I can to influence '' Fed policy .
The Fed 's policy-making Open Market Committee met last week and voted unanimously to boost short-term interest rates by one-half percentage point , indicating it had more reason to believe pricing pressures were imminent and sending out a message that it intends to aggressively fight inflation .
Mr. Clinton made his comments as the Fed disclosed that its decision to hold interest rates steady in early July was nearly unanimous , but that it was leaning toward higher interest rates because `` the risk of inflationary momentum in the expansion remained high .
'' The Fed released a summary of the July 5 and 6 meeting of the Open Market Committee after the usual waiting period .
In July , only Alfred Broaddus , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , Va. , voted to raise interest rates .
He felt that `` additional near-term tightening was necessary to contain inflation , '' according to the summary .
Mr. Broaddus also doubted that the four prior interestrate increases since February `` would prove sufficient to prevent higher inflation given the strength of the economic expansion .
'' The other 10 members -- Janet Yellen was n't yet confirmed as a Fed governor -- took a wait-and-see attitude because `` the economy seemed to be slowing , although to an uncertain extent .
'' However , the group did lean toward higher interest rates at the time and left open the possibility of raising rates before its next meeting , which was held last Tuesday .
At his news conference , Mr. Clinton said it was possible the economy could be slowed down too much by rate increases , though he has n't seen any such evidence yet .
Until one year ago , at least two of our 1,600 employees a day would wake up and feel forced to tell a lie -- they would call in sick to stay home and care for a sick child .
Employees repeatedly told managers at our company , Schering-Plough Healthcare Products in Memphis , that this was n't what they wanted .
What they really wanted opened on Aug. 16 , 1993 : A Children 's Place , a $ 900,000 on-site child care center for infants to five-year-olds , with a `` Sniffles and Snuggles '' room for mildly ill youngsters up to age 12 .
When the need arises , employees telephone the center and arrange for a spot in Sniffles and Snuggles .
Under the watchful eye of a student nurse or a pediatrician , the child goes into a softly colored room with up to five other ill youngsters for a day of sleeping in a cozy bed , watching videos , listening to the radio and playing quiet games .
Figures from the first six months of operation showed that Sniffles and Snuggles saved the company about $ 26,000 .
In less than one year of operation , the sick-child care room saved 180 employee workdays , amounting to more than the $ 20,000 it costs to administer the program for an entire year .
Our employees now tell us they felt guilty about neglecting their jobs to care for a mildly ill child , but they did n't have a choice .
Deciding between the job and a sick child is a very real problem for employee-parents nationwide .
According to `` Childcare and Corporate Productivity '' by John Fernandez -LRB- D.C. Heath & Co. , 1986 -RRB- , a survey of 5,000 employees at five major U.S. corporations showed that 82 % of working parents said they missed days at work , were tardy , had left work early , and had used work time to deal with various child-care problems .
The survey put the lost work time at eight days per parent .
In our Memphis facility , based on the number of employees we have with children under six years old , this would add up to about 2,200 days a year .
Such lost work time amounts to millions of dollars across the American work force .
Saving those dollars is an economic issue that cuts across business lines .
The American work force is dominated now by dual-career families , and federal statistics show that women make up two-thirds of the new entrants into the labor market .
Competition for the most skilled , reliable and talented employees is heating up .
Child care and related family issues have become a bottom-line issue for most companies , no matter what they make or sell .
That 's why we were interested in starting up A Children 's Place .
The 8,200-square-foot center , with its age-specific swings , slides , tricycles and even a vegetable garden , opened with a capacity of 82 youngsters .
Annual nonfacility-related expenses total $ 148,000 a year , and the center is operated by Corporate Child Care Management Services Inc. under contract .
Parents pay $ 70 to $ 85 a week , with scholarships available .
A Children 's Place now has a waiting list .
But even with a brand-new child care center or a subsidized child care program , a child 's illness is still the number-one reason a parent-employee is absent .
Most day-care centers and schools send ill children home , fearing that they will infect others and lacking the proper facilities to care for them .
The parent-employee focus groups that worked to develop A Children 's Place saw early on the need for a safe place to put youngsters who have a low-grade fever , a cold , or who are recovering from strep throat or a recent vaccine .
But care for sick children appeared to be an expensive and tricky situation in a group setting such as A Children 's Place .
Three keys to a successful sick-child program emerged from our research : consistent staffing , flexibility and affordability for parents .
Some companies that tried sick-child programs in their centers staffed them on an as-needed basis .
Many times the part-time caregivers were unavailable ; the care was sporadic and parents stopped using it .
In another situation , a hospital offered care for the sick children of working parents , but it was $ 35 a day per child .
The sick room at A Children 's Place is isolated from the rest of the day-care center and staffed every day by a medically trained person .
Two days a week , a student nurse from one of the hospital training programs takes care of youngsters at no cost to the center as a part of her college requirements .
The other three days a pediatrician cares for any sick children .
Sniffles and Snuggles is averaging two children a day .
Employees whose children do not regularly attend A Children 's Place are welcome as drop-ins , but they must be pre-registered .
For children already enrolled in the center there is no extra charge for sick-room care , but drop-ins pay $ 15 a day -- and fees include meals and snacks .
What do sick-room caregivers do if there are no sick children ?
They must be flexible enough to work with the regular classroom teachers -- for example , older toddlers are learning folk songs from the pediatrician .
The children become accustomed to seeing the Sniffles and Snuggles caregivers in the classrooms , and that makes the sick-child room less threatening .
It also stretches the staffing dollar .
Although the total economic value of A Children 's Place to the company is still being assessed , preliminary figures -- and anecdotal evidence from grateful parents -- shows Sniffles and Snuggles has real bottom-line value .

SANTIAGO , Chile -- Executives of Chile state-run copper concern Codelco disclosed that its former chief futures trader used a fictitious series of trades that accounted for the bulk of the company 's $ 200 million copper-futures losses last year .
The trader , Juan Pablo Davila , generated false profits and hid losses during a period between January 1991 and February 1992 , Juan Villarzu , head of Codelco , said at a news conference .
Of the 5,900 trades Mr. Davila made in the period , Mr. Villarzu said about 45 % were `` unusual '' or `` fictitious , '' according to Dow Jones Emerging Markets Report .
From Aug. 8-11 , Codelco officials traveled to the U.S. and London to discuss with futures-market regulators possible irregularities in Mr. Davila 's trades , and potential links between him and metals-market traders outside of Chile .
Codelco officials stressed that auditors Ernst & Young have found no evidence of an illicit link between Mr. Davila and the brokers who handled his trades in the London market .
Rather , Mr. Villarzu said , the London market 's regulations , looser than those governing the U.S. and Chilean futures markets , enabled Mr. Davila to trade large volumes of copper futures and to easily obtain margin facilities without required approval by Chilean government officials .
Mr. Davila had worked in the London market for Codelco for two years before evidence of his unusual trades apparently was discovered .
Codelco officials declined to identify the brokers .
Capping a weekend of tightening the screws on Fidel Castro 's Cuba , the Clinton administration signaled it might be prepared to consider further steps -- including a naval blockade of the Caribbean island .
The administration is gambling that such tough actions and rhetoric will prompt Mr. Castro to stem the exodus of Cuban boat people , thus avoiding political problems that would be brought by a surge of refugees into Florida .
But in the long run , the aggressive U.S. policy could lock Mr. Clinton into a pattern of escalating rhetoric against the aging Cuban leader and could back the U.S. into taking increasingly tougher actions .
Mr. Clinton 's moves also are sure to stir a longstanding debate .
For decades , the fault line of Cuba policy has divided those who believe that Mr. Castro should be coaxed into reforms with carrots , including a partial lifting of the U.S. economic embargo , from those who advocate increased economic and political pressure to destabilize the Communist government .
Underscoring that Mr. Clinton has opted for toughness , White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said yesterday on ABC News ' `` This Week with David Brinkley '' that a blockade is `` obviously one of the options that we would look at in the future , as we see whether or not Castro begins to make some legitimate moves toward democracy .
'' However , a U.S. official said there have been no planning sessions on a blockade .
On Saturday , the administration said it would prohibit Americans from sending cash to Cuba , a move designed to deprive Havana of about $ 500 million yearly , and cut off charter flights to the island .
The administration also plans to step up radio and television broadcasts to Cuba and call on the United Nations to examine Cuba 's human-rights record .
The moves were taken at least partly to insulate Mr. Clinton from criticism -- particularly from some Cuban-Americans -- that his initial decision to interdict Cuban rafters at sea and send them to the U.S. Naval facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , was punishing people fleeing the regime rather than Mr. Castro .
Mr. Clinton appears to have satisfied many of his critics for now , but his policy is n't without risks .
Guantanamo , which already holds nearly 15,000 Haitian boat people , could become a flashpoint for troubles between the U.S. and Cuba .
Tensions in Guantanamo , where usually mild-mannered Haitians rioted recently , are sure to rise if the new immigration policy does n't halt the flow of Cuban boat people , and if thousands need to be warehoused there .
Tensions in Guantanamo would surely echo in Miami , where Cuban-Americans would agitate to win the release of their family members .
While Haitian boat people have at least the prospect of returning home soon as the result of U.S. pressure , there is little likelihood of any significant change in Cuba that would permit Cubans to return anytime soon .
`` Guantanamo is the only place in the world where Cuban and U.S. armed troops are within shooting distance of each other , '' notes Gillian Gunn , who directs Georgetown University 's Cuba Project .
`` The mix -- Cubans going in , Haitians trying to get out , land mines , nervous Marines with weapons in their hands , nervous Cuban troops with weapons in their hands -- is explosive , '' she warns .
Moreover , says Rep. Robert Torricelli , a New Jersey Democrat and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs , the prospect of a Cuban population on free Cuban soil in Guantanamo is `` prompting a lot of creative thinking '' among staunchly anti-Castro Cuban-American leaders .
Mr. Torricelli says some of these leaders are talking about such measures as electing a council of Cubans at Guantanamo and issuing manifestos opposing the Castro regime .
One U.S. official worries privately that , now that Mr. Clinton has chosen to follow a tough policy , there will be demands by some influential Cuban-Americans to keep raising the pressure on Mr. Castro to bring about the fall of his regime .
The official observes that similar pressure by the Congressional Black Caucus has largely driven the administration 's policy toward Haiti and led to threats of a U.S. invasion .
On the other hand , the administration may win its gamble .
Given the eggshell-like fragility of Cuban society at the moment , there are great risks for Mr. Castro as well .
`` He runs the risk of having things get out of control if people start flooding into Oriente , '' the province where Guantanamo is located , says Edward Gonzalez , an analyst at Rand Corp. .
Adds Marifeli Perez-Stable , a Cuba expert at the State University of New York : `` My guess is that he will retreat a little bit .
'' LONDON -- Who would have thought Britain could ever become a low-inflation country ?
Certainly not the United Kingdom 's bond market .
Despite doomsayers ' predictions the country would quickly return to double-digit price rises when it abandoned the European Exchange Rate Mechanism two years ago , inflation in Britain looks well under control and that should be good news for the bond market .
Data released last week showed consumer prices excluding mortgage payments rising at a 2.2 % rate , the lowest level in 27 years .
More importantly , inflation has been declining steadily since early 1990 and has been comfortably below 4 % for the past year and a half .
But the U.K. government-bond -- or Gilt -- market so far has largely ignored the cheerful messages sent from the real economy .
Instead it has been caught up with the gloom pervading European fixed-income markets , intensified by fears that Germany 's central bank may have finished its cycle of lowering interest rates .
Yields on five-year Gilts are now up to nearly 8.6 % , having risen more or less steadily from a low 5.51 % in January .
Ten-year Gilts have performed slightly better , but still are now yielding 8.85 % , about 2.9 percentage points more than they did at the beginning of the year .
Sentiment in European bond markets appears to be dominated by the belief that if interest rates are rising somewhere in the developed world , they ` re soon to be raised at home .
That 's why bond prices began stumbling in February after the U.S. Federal Reserve began raising its key interest rates .
The decision by the central banks of Sweden and Italy to raise their interest rates a half percentage point earlier this month dealt European bonds another blow .
The bet was the U.K. would be the next to raise rates , perhaps as early as Sept. 7 , when Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George next meet .
Some experts said all bets should be off .
`` Market expectations are rapidly moving toward a hike in November now , but January or later looks more reasonable , '' said Ian Shepherdson , an economist at Midland Global Markets in London .
Most economists expect Britain 's gross domestic product to expand by about 3 % this year after a 1.9 % increase in 1993 .
By comparison , the U.S. economy grew 3 % last year , nearly twice the rate of Britain , and is expected to grow by a further 3.7 % this year .
U.K. retail sales figures for July , issued last week , showed a robust 0.4 % increase , but the gains were accounted for entirely by food sales .
Nonfood sale volumes were actually down 0.7 % , falling for the second month in a row .
The benign inflation environment means the U.K. Gilt market now boasts some of the highest real yields in Europe .
-LRB- Real yields are determined by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal yield of the bond -RRB- .
U.K. 10-year Gilts carry a real yield of about 6.1 % , compared with 3.9 % in Germany , 5.9 % in France , 4.4 % in the Netherlands , and 5.5 % in Belgium .
Some strategists said the 10 - to 20-year area of the British bond market looks most attractive because its new supply is likely to be low in coming months .
Indeed , the Bank of England said Friday there will be no Gilt auction this month due to `` substantial funding progress already achieved .
'' Others are more keen on the `` short-end , '' or the one-month to one-year area .
Short sterling futures contracts are predicting rates will rise to about 6.75 % by September from 5.4 % Friday , said Midland 's Mr. Shepherdson .
`` That 's ridiculous , '' he added .
`` The market has a bee in its bonnet about inflation and is looking for signs any place it can find them -- it 's a classic bear market that makes little sense .
'' But analysts said there is little justification for the pessimism .
Among the factors that probably will eliminate the need to raise U.K. interest rates are a series of personal tax increases that came in effect last April and the planned increase to 17.5 % from 8 % on value-added tax on fuel for next April .
In addition , Glenn Davies , chief economist at Credit Lyonnais EuroSecurities in London , said there has been a kind of indirect monetary tightening caused by the reduction of tax relief on mortgages from 25 % last year to 20 % this year and 15 % in 1993 .
The steady rise in U.K. bond yields has also tempered the housing market because fixed-rate mortgage rates have been forced to keep pace with the fixed-income market .
Finally , increased competition in the retail sector has helped keep prices low and high unemployment has meant labor costs remain relatively steady , said Katy Peters , senior economist at Daiwa Europe Ltd. in London .
The jobless rate in Britain is 9.3 % .
That figure is down from 10.4 % a year ago , but economists said the drop is due to people finding part-time jobs or abandoning the labor force .
In a setback to the managed-futures industry , the Virginia Retirement System last week eliminated its $ 460 million program to invest in commodity and financial futures .
Virginia 's state pension fund , with $ 16.1 billion in assets , unveiled its managed-futures program with fanfare in 1991 .
That high-profile venture enticed other traditionally conservative pension investors to take the plunge , too .
Virginia 's retreat comes at a time when the managed-futures industry is enjoying strong growth -- buoyed by an influx of funds from institutional investors .
According to Barclay Research Group Ltd. , a Fairfield , Iowa-based firm that tracks managers of futures programs , the industry 's assets under management have more than doubled since 1990 to $ 24.5 billion .
`` Virginia was sort of a pioneer , '' said Frank Franiak , vice president of Glenwood Trust Co. in Chicago , one of the five managers being let go by the Virginia fund .
`` This will shed a negative light on the use of managed futures by institutions .
'' Virginia 's bold foray into futures did n't produce any brilliant returns for the fund .
Its managed-futures programs had an annual rate of return of just 6 % over the past three years , compared with about 8.9 % for the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index , said Kemp Dozier , chief investment officer of the Virginia Retirement System .
Dragging on performance were hefty commission costs of `` well over 2 % '' a year , and management fees of 1.5 % , he added .
That compares with typical expenses of just 0.10 percentage point for an S&P 500 index fund .
Even so , many pension fund investors and futures managers do n't expect Virginia 's pullout to touch off an exodus of funds .
They believe the retreat largely reflects recent turnover in the pension fund 's board of trustees , rather than troubles with managed futures .
Meanwhile , Virginia 's decision does n't reflect any broad shift away from derivatives by the pension fund , Mr. Dozier stressed .
The fund employs a variety of derivatives-related strategies to manage risk .
For example , its traditional money managers regularly use stock index futures to deploy the fund 's cash , enabling it to keep a fixed portion of its assets in stocks even when cash floods in .
`` We 're not saying that utilization of futures in the portfolio should n't continue , '' says Mr. Dozier .
`` We 're merely saying we do n't want them to be a separate asset class .
'' The decision to drop managed futures was instituted by the fund 's board of trustees on the recommendation of its investment advisory committee .
Both the board and the investment committee were revamped earlier this year after the state 's Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission called for changes in the fund 's governance .
The previous board , which initiated the program , had recently voted to boost the amount of managed-futures investments to 4 % of assets -- or as much as $ 650 million .
W. Gordon Binns Jr. , chairman of the advisory committee , said that the recommendation to drop the program was n't unanimous .
`` Several members , including myself , felt that the program should n't be terminated yet , '' said Mr. Binns , who retired in June as president and chief executive officer of General Motors Investment Management Corp. , which manages General Motors Corp. 's pension fund .
People in the industry , as well as others close to the fund , charge that eliminating the managed-futures program was more a political than an investment decision .
The new board was more intent on asserting its authority than in improving the quality of the fund 's investments , they argue .
Indeed , a study conducted for the state legislature by Bear Stearns Fiduciary Services Inc. concluded that the managed-futures program was sound , but that the fund paid too much in fees for these and other investment services .
`` You had a board in there for several years that had studied managed-futures for a long time , and then a totally new board comes in and within three months they put aside all that investigation and say , ` We 're out of here , ' '' complained Doug Steger , president of American Capital Finance Group , a Chicago consultant that specializes in nontraditional investment strategies .
The chief complaint about the managed-futures program was that advisers ' fees and commissions were too high , said Mr. Dozier , the Virginia fund 's chief investment officer .
`` The industry has to wake up to the realization that its fees and commission structure is not competitive with that in the equity market , '' he added .
`` I 'm anticipating that if fees do n't come down , there wo n't be a continued move of public funds into this area of investment .
'' The Virginia managed-futures account -- which was half in stock and bond futures , with the remaining equally divided between currency and commodity futures -- will gradually be moved into short-term fixed investments , and then mostly invested in stocks , said James C. Wheat III , chairman of the board of trustees and a partner in a leveraged-buyout fund called Riverfront Partners .
The fund 's attack on fees rankles managed-futures advisers .
They argue that it 's understandable that fees are higher for nontraditional strategies and they insist their costs are n't out of line .
Moreover , they contend that fees in the futures industry are all fully disclosed , whereas investors in other markets are often hit by hidden fees .
`` The board looked at the execution costs and said they were high , when in fact they have the best costs in the world , '' said Richard Pike , president of RP Consulting Group Inc. in St. Petersburg , Fla. , who monitors the Virginia fund 's five managed-futures advisers .
Despite Virginia 's exit , there 's still a lot of new pension money flowing into managed futures .
Indeed , the Illinois Teachers Retirement System plans to initiate a managed-futures program within the next few months .
Bob Daniels , executive director of the $ 12 billion pension fund , said the fund is negotiating to invest $ 25 million in managed futures .
He pointed out that the Illinois Teachers fund is no stranger to innovative investments , being among the first funds to venture into overseas stock markets in the early 1980s .
`` The Virginia decision does n't mean anything to us , '' Mr. Daniels said .
`` We 've studied managed futures for two years and seen the mistakes other have made and will try to avoid them .
'' Another newcomer to managed futures , the San Diego County Employees Retirement Association , kicked off its program in March with an investment of $ 45 million , 2 % of the fund 's total $ 2.2 billion in assets .
Rich Rose , the fund 's chief investment officer , is sticking to his guns .
`` We 're confident about our program , '' Mr. Rose said .
`` We 're going to evaluate it on its own merits , not on what other people do .
'' NEW YORK -- Artisoft Inc. says a yearlong effort to diversify its product line , expand its distribution channels and reach for new revenue from abroad is on track .
The nimble networking company also described its business as `` solid .
'' Chief Executive William C. Keiper said the company 's goal is to capitalize on the flourishing market for computer-networking products in homes and small offices .
He said the company 's Simply LANtastic is being repackaged and repositioned for an expected re-release in the fiscal second quarter , ending Dec. 31 .
The price of the product , targeted for office or home use by five or fewer networked computers , has already been lowered .
There 's `` no reason we should n't own that segment '' of the networking market , Mr. Keiper said in an interview .
He said he views the product as especially appropriate for home users of a desktop computer who want to link it with a laptop .
Likewise , the company is preparing to kick off an 18-city tour and will spend three weeks meeting with value-added retailers .
The idea is to better acquaint the retailers with CorStream , the company 's 32-bit server .
The sessions will focus on helping retailers better sell the product and will give them advice on installation , Mr. Keiper said .
CorStream , unveiled in June , has received generally good reviews , but its ease of installation has been criticized , he said .
At the same time , Mr. Keiper said reports in the financial community were incorrect in blaming lower-than-expected sales of LANtastic 6.0 to distributors for fiscal fourth-quarter revenue that came in $ 1 million to $ 1.5 million under expectations .
The company ended the quarter with a $ 2 million order backlog , an increase from previous quarters , Mr. Keiper said .
The orders , including many for Eagle Technology products , could n't be filled before the quarter closed , he said .
The executive said the company 's strategy has been to diversify its revenue base by adding new products , spurring sales abroad and broadening its distribution channel .
Product diversification includes LANtastic 6.0 and CorStream , both brought out this year .
Additional new products are planned before December , including some from Eagle Technology .
Artisoft purchased Eagle early this year , and Mr. Keiper said he believes Eagle 's share of the Ethernet market is growing .
Mr. Keiper declined to make earnings projections .
Employees at Tultex Corp. voted to affiliate with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union after several failed attempts .
The Martinsville , Va. , apparel manufacturer said the election was the fifth attempt since 1979 .
With more than 60 % of votes cast , the union won by a vote of 1,321 to 710 .
The union said the election covers about 2,300 Tultex workers at manufacturing and distribution facilities in Virginia 's Martinsville and Henry counties .
Bruce Raynor , executive vice president and southern regional director of the union , called the victory `` tremendously significant '' for workers in the counties .
Tultex chief executive John Franck said the company was disappointed by the election results .
He added , `` we must begin the healing process and come together in order to be successful once again .
'' MORE FM commercial radio stations are switching to alternative\/modern-rock formats , opening a market for advertisers who can tap audiences once loyal to the noncommercial stations that played such music .
The switch has many Top 40 stations moving from a diet of Phil Collins , Michael Bolton and Mariah Carey to a platter of Nine Inch Nails , Pearl Jam and Tori Amos .
`` There are stations changing every week , '' says Jeff Pollack , chairman of Pollack Media Group .
He estimates there are nearly 75 .
`` We 've seen a complete upheaval in music that 's created huge audiences .
It 's perfect for radio stations to embrace .
'' Alternative\/modern rock reaches 18 - to 34-year-olds , most of whom are college educated , computer literate and open to trying new products .
By comparison , the album-oriented rock format , with acts such as Bruce Springsteen and Van Halen , reaches a slightly older audience .
As the market for Top 40 has become saturated and fragmented , stations find the alternative\/modern rock format less competitive and a better-defined field to pursue advertisers .
WENZ in Cleveland says its advertising revenue doubled after it switched from a contemporary-hit format to modern rock .
`` Advertisers see the beauty of tapping a responsive audience like this , '' says station manager Bill Scull .
`` While the audience may not be as large , they are big purchasers of computers , clothing and entertainment products .
'' Similarly , KNDD in Seattle , which switched in 1991 to modern rock from an adult-contemporary format , says its listenership has jumped about 150 % .
`` We have a very educated , white-collar , affluent consumer , '' says Anna Shreeve , station manager .
`` Advertisers see us as a must if they want to reach opinion leaders .
'' Other leaders in mass markets include Atlanta 's WNNX , WHTZ in New York and long-time alternative station KROQ in Los Angeles .
Stations must use caution when selecting advertisers .
`` They 've got to keep the image and look street-savvy , '' says Robert Unmacht , editor of M Street Journal , which tracks the Federal Communications Commission and station programming .
But the switch is wise , he says .
`` This is Generation X growing up and becoming a desirable market .
'' THE GROWING popularity of female performers in modern rock has given a marketing boost to bands with female members .
The success of talents like Sarah McLachlan , Liz Phair , L7 and Sheryl Crow has trained audiences to look for similar talent locally in clubs and smaller venues .
`` You 're almost more likely to do well now if you have a woman in the band , '' says Laura Ballance , bass guitarist for SuperChunk and cofounder of Merge Records in Chapel Hill , N.C. , a small label for mainly alternative artists .
Agrees former Let 's Active guitarist Angie Carlson , who now plays lead guitar in her Chapel Hill band Grover : `` As people have become more aware of womenfronted bands , it 's made it possible for these bands to do better .
'' And more of today 's bands with female members often take a harder edge than their predecessors , not just musically but with lyrics blatantly embracing tough subjects such as rape , homosexuality and sexual harassment .

Fleet Financial Group Inc. made a $ 5 million cash infusion into three money-market funds to make up for derivative-related losses in their $ 1.9 billion portfolios .
Because the losses could have reduced the funds ' per-share value below $ 1 , the cash infusion saved them from `` breaking the buck , '' an event that could shake investors ' confidence in money funds .
Money-market funds , which nationwide have $ 600 billion in assets and are usually considered safe investments , generally offer higher yields than bank deposits , but without the same kind of deposit insurance .
That 's why several institutions have taken money out of their own pockets this year to bail out money funds that have suffered losses .
Other fund bailouts that have been disclosed include BankAmerica Corp. 's two money funds , Pacific Horizon Government Fund and Pacific Horizon Prime Money Market Fund , and the Zweig Cash Fund , a government money-market fund .
People familiar with the money-fund market said Fleet has sold more than $ 100 million of derivative securities whose value had been hurt by this year 's violent , unexpected increase in interest rates .
Such derivatives offered higher rates than other money-market securities , but also carried additional risk of principal loss if rates rose .
A spokesman for Fleet , based in Providence , R.I. , declined to say how much of the securities were sold , but he confirmed that it injected $ 5 million to keep the funds from falling below a $ 1-a-share net asset value , the level that investors have come to expect money funds to maintain .
The cash infusion was distributed among three money market funds : Galaxy Money Market Fund , Galaxy Government Fund and Galaxy U.S. Treasury Fund .
These funds are part of Galaxy Funds , which are managed by Fleet Investment Advisors , a subsidiary of Fleet Financial Group .
`` We infused a modest amount to protect the funds from breaking a dollar , '' said Thomas Lavelle , a Fleet spokesman .
`` As rates began to go up , we were concerned about certain securities -- structured notes -- held in our money-market funds .
We began a comprehensive review and moved aggressively to sell securities in an orderly fashion .
'' He said the `` selling program '' was completed in the middle of July and the funds have held no derivatives since then .
Boosted Yield Many money funds used derivatives to help boost their yields last year , at a time when interest rates were falling to 25-year lows .
Derivatives are complex financial arrangements whose returns are based on , or derived from , fluctuations in the price of some other asset .
When interest rates started to spike up this year , some of these derivatives lost value .
Analysts say the use of derivatives helped boost the yield of Fleet 's Galaxy Government Fund .
The fund on April 26 had a seven-day compound yield of 3.22 % , which was 0.17 of a percentage point higher than the average yield for money funds that held only government securities , according to Money Fund Report , an Ashland , Mass. , newsletter .
But now the fund is yielding just slightly more than average .
As of Aug. 9 , its seven-day compound yield was 3.80 % , compared with an industry average of 3.75 % .
The Galaxy fund 's assets also have fallen to $ 603 million from $ 667 million in late April .
But assets of the Galaxy Money Market Fund have increased , to a current $ 796 million , from $ 611 million in April .
Galaxy U.S. Treasury Fund 's assets currently are $ 488 million .
It is understood that a couple of types of derivatives caused problems for the Galaxy money-market funds .
One type was securities linked to a `` cofi , '' or cost-of-funds index .
Among them are various government securities whose interest rates rise and fall in line with monthly changes in the Federal Home Loan Bank 's 11th district cost of funds .
Another type was dual-index floaters , which are securities whose interest-rate reset provisions are tied to more than one index , so that a change in the relationship between these indexes may result in the value of the instrument falling below par , or face value .
Money-market funds that invested in derivative securities have already sold their riskiest holdings , industry analysts say , in response to a prodding in early July from the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Industry regulators say only a few dozen funds held these risky securities .
`` In most cases we are aware of , the funds are out of the problem securities , '' said Robert Plaze , assistant director of the SEC 's investment management division .

BALTIMORE -- Moving quickly to put the firing of Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. behind it , the board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People selected a respected veteran staff member as interim administrator and prepared to set about repairing its credibility .
After conferring for nearly 10 hours in a special meeting Saturday , board members appointed Earl T. Shinhoster , 44 years old , as senior interim administrator .
Mr. Shinhoster , NAACP national field secretary , had come in second to Mr. Chavis in voting for the top spot in April 1993 .
Mr. Shinhoster , formerly head of the NAACP 's southeast regional office , has been a member for more than 30 years .
The firing of Mr. Chavis -- only four or five of the 59 board members attending the meeting supported him -- `` was a major step in re-establishing our credibility , '' said one board member .
The meeting had been called after reports of widespread financial problems , including a report that Mr. Chavis had committed to pay , without the knowledge of the board or general counsel , as much as $ 332,400 of the association 's money to settle a sexual harassment complaint by a former employee .
Mr. Chavis has said the agreement covered sex discrimination , not sexual harassment .
`` We need to move forward and stabilize the hemorrhaging of our expenditures and restore confidence in the NAACP , '' said Joseph Madison , a Washington-area radio personality , board member and Chavis critic .
`` That 's our No. 1 priority .
'' The board also named Fred Rasheed , director of the NAACP 's economic development programs , to assist Mr. Shinhoster .
Both men , who will be helped by a subcommittee of board members , were asked to run the organization for 30 to 60 days while a search is conducted for a new executive director .
A separate committee was established to decide how to reduce the association 's more than $ 3 million deficit .
Although Mr. Chavis 's administration most likely was doomed when he entered the special meeting called to review his performance , people within the organization said that Mr. Chavis made the vote against him easy .
They said he opened his defense to the board by saying , `` I understand someone 's head has to roll today .
'' Several said Mr. Chavis continued to say , `` I did nothing wrong .
I did nothing to apologize for .
'' Hours later yesterday , across town in a large Baptist church , Mr. Chavis was putting the firing behind him .
Speaking there at the second national African-American Leadership Summit , with his wife and the Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan at his side , he said : `` I 'm not here to point fingers or lay blame .
My wife and I are here together and the leaders are here together , and we 're going to be moving forward .
'' The summit was originally to be sponsored by the NAACP , but the organization withdrew after Mr. Chavis was fired .
Supporters of Mr. Chavis are urging him to start a new , independent civil-rights organization , while at the same time asking for NAACP members to show their support for Mr. Chavis .
Mr. Chavis , 46 , took over the helm of the venerable civil rights organization last year , vowing to reinvigorate it by reaching out to young people and the poor .
He hit the ground running , holding gang summits and staying in public housing projects .
But it was his efforts to bring black separatists and nationalists and the controversial Mr. Farrakhan into a working relationship with the NAACP that brought divisions within the organization to the fore .
Longtime supporters of the NAACP saw no reason to reach out to the radicals , and many feared that by embracing Mr. Farrakhan and inviting him to the first black leaders summit held in June , the NAACP would lose corporate and foundation contributions and dues from unhappy members .
The critics feared that Mr. Chavis was attempting to redirect the organization away from its mainstream integrationist focus , an allegation he repeatedly denied .
At the same time , they viewed what they considered profligate spending and inattention to the more traditional membership by Mr. Chavis as adding to the organization 's financial crisis .
People within the NAACP said the organization has bills that are more than a year overdue .
While Mr. Chavis defends his outreach as having brought in new members , an accounting that board members received at the end of July showed membership had fallen to 356,299 from 381,895 a year earlier .
Caught in the crossfire amid the controversies was the NAACP 's chairman , William F. Gibson , in part because he was Mr. Chavis 's staunchest supporter .
People within the organization said Dr. Gibson had used his influence on the board to get enough votes to appoint Mr. Chavis 16 months ago .
The insiders said Mr. Chavis got the job because he had agreed to share the limelight with Dr. Gibson , an allegation the chairman has always denied .
But within the past two weeks , Dr. Gibson 's support for Mr. Chavis appeared to wane , as critics called for both their heads .
There were no moves to oust the chairman over the weekend , but his power was significantly weakened .
The Southside Chicago branch of the organization , which had been a strong supporter of Mr. Chavis , surprised longtime members by calling Wednesday for both men 's resignation .
That followed by a week the West Virginia group 's call for both of them to resign , and other chapters said they were holding dues and other money due to the national organization in escrow until an audit of headquarters finances could be completed .
Dr. Gibson , 61 , became chairman of the NAACP in 1985 , and although friends said that he always longed to be its executive director -- which he denies -- that position has eluded him .
Dr. Gibson , a dentist from Greenville , S.C. , has enjoyed the support of the board members from the South , where the chapters are most populous .
He had a cadre of board members , who called themselves the Tribe , who influenced the board to see that he got his way most of the time .
Dr. Gibson voted with the majority to oust Mr. Chavis , according to people at the meeting .
NEW YORK -- One big selling point of real estate investment trust stocks is their high yields .
That 's also the problem with REITs -- at least at tax time .
Merrill Lynch & Co. is trying to resolve this conundrum , using the template of its `` Mitts '' listed equity-derivative product .
Mitts are securities -- actually senior debt of Merrill -- that represent a basket of related stocks and deliver one payment at maturity determined by the change in the value of the underlying stocks .
Merrill sold Mitts -- the acronym for Market Index Target-Term Securities -- tied to the value of the Standard & Poor 's 500 index , a portfolio of European stocks and a group of telecommunications issues .
Merrill has bundled 20 REIT stocks and this week registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer $ 25 million of Mitts based on the group .
For every $ 10 in principal -- the face value of one Mitts unit -- investors will receive at maturity in six years an amount representing a part of the total return of the stocks , including share-price appreciation and accumulated dividends .
The value of the Mitts will be determined by applying a multiplier -- which will be set at the deal 's pricing -- to the stocks in the market capitalization-weighted REIT portfolio .
If the multiplier yields a unit value higher than $ 10 , investors will be paid that amount .
But if the value of each Mitts is at or less than $ 9 after six years , investors will receive a $ 9 payment , meaning the risk to principal is capped at 10 % .
This provision is the key to the tax advantages of Mitts , Lehman Brothers Inc. tax specialist Robert Willens said .
By setting the guaranteed fixed payment at less than the issue price , Merrill gives investors the chance to sidestep `` bifurcation rules .
'' The maneuver defers taxes until maturity .
`` What they 're trying to achieve for investors is not having to pay taxes at any time before you actually get the cash , '' Mr. Willens said .
`` And that 's what will in fact happen here .
'' Had the fixed payment been set at the issue price or higher , the bifurcation rules would apply .
This means investors would have been required for tax purposes to allocate a portion of the $ 10 purchase price to the right to receive the fixed payment and a portion to the investment play on REIT stocks .
The difference between the portion allocated to `` buy '' the fixed payment and the amount of that payment itself would then have to be considered income , and taxes would then be due on the amount .
With Mitts , investors will owe taxes only on whatever gain is realized after six years on their $ 10 investment .
The Mitts structure is n't without an embedded tradeoff , however .
Investment gains on Mitts will be considered interest income and thus taxed at the income rate .
Under the bifurcation rules , part of the gain would have been taxed at the lower capital-gains rate , Lehman Brothers ' Mr. Willens said .
Any structure that allows investors to escape taxes on income is useful to investors in REIT stocks , many of which yield more than 8 % a year .
The Mitts do heighten the importance of REITs ' capital appreciation driven by internal profit growth .
Profit expansion is n't the hallmark of REITs , which must dispense most earnings to investors to maintain their own favorable tax status .
Bruce Garrison , an analyst at Kidder , Peabody & Co. , estimates that `` the better names '' are likely to post total returns of 11 % a year in the next three years , with the smaller or more speculative stocks priced closer to 13 % to 14 % .
An estimate of the annual return on Merrill 's REIT basket might be about 12 % over six years , Mr. Garrison said .
Mr. Garrison calculated that such a growth rate would produce a value at maturity of $ 19.74 for every $ 10 invested in the underlying REIT stocks .
But Mitts investors wo n't reap the full capital appreciation of the underlying stocks .
Just how much of share-price gains will flow through to Mitts buyers wo n't be determined until the exact formula is set at pricing .
Also , Mitts ' capital growth wo n't reflect the reinvestment of dividends , according to the registration statement .
The terms of the deal make it hard for Merrill to lose much .
Even in the event that the portfolio after six years is worth much less than the $ 9 Merrill owes investors , the firm will have been paid $ 1 for every $ 10 of what effectively is six-year debt .
The REIT Mitts will trade as units on the New York Stock Exchange , as do Merrill 's existing Mitts .
While they do have some use as a trading instrument , REIT stocks are n't particularly volatile .
This will decrease their value for trading and will likely keep trading volume low .
The existing Mitts issues have n't traded briskly .
Even the Mitts tied to a group of telecommunications stocks , which tend to be relatively volatile , have average daily trading volume of 12,500 and sluggish price movement .
JOHANNESBURG , South Africa -- The Central Selling Organization , through which South Africa 's De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. controls world-wide sales of rough diamonds , is confident it can overcome what some analysts are calling one of the sternest challenges in the organization 's 60-year history .
The analysts believe the London-based CSO faces a threat to its dominance of the diamond trade , primarily from the recent flood of unauthorized sales of Russian diamonds outside CSO 's control , but also from the prospect of significant diamond output from Canada 's Northwest Territories .
But De Beers insists it can overcome these obstacles .
`` Russia 's interest in maintaining the value of its diamond inventory ... will prevent it from ruining the diamond business , '' said Gary Ralfe , CSO managing director .
Mr. Ralfe said in an interview that the tensions that have surfaced between De Beers and Russia , as they renegotiate marketing arrangements , do n't detract from the fundamental relationship of `` a willing buyer talking to willing seller .
'' De Beers Centenary AG , the Switzerland-based De Beers affiliate that runs the CSO , estimates that about $ 350 million of Russian diamonds -- about 8 % of De Beers 's own diamond sales -- were sold last year outside the CSO .
That provides a potent threat to the CSO , which limits diamond sales when demand is weak in order to maintain world rough-diamond prices , which it says have n't matched the steady improvement in the retail diamond jewelry market during the past 18 months .
De Beers itself supplies about 50 % of the world 's diamonds , but through the CSO arrangements it has marketing control over 80 % of the total rough-diamond trade .
Analysts say Russian gems are often cheaper and of better quality than material the CSO allocates its clients .
And they worry that De Beers 's balance sheet will come under further strain if it is forced to buy the ever-larger quantities of rough diamonds that fall outside CSO control in order to defend prices .
`` De Beers needs all the resources it can muster to control the diamond trade , but its balance sheet is under real strain for a group which acts as central banker to the industry , '' said Michael Coulson , international mining analyst at London stockbroker Credit Lyonnais Laing .
De Beers 's long-term debt rose to $ 1.09 billion at June 30 from $ 861 million at the end of June 1993 .
And partly as a result of its efforts to defend prices , the value of De Beers 's diamond stocks rose to $ 4.03 billion at June 30 from $ 3.28 billion a year earlier .
Mr. Coulson expects the weak diamond market to push stocks toward $ 5 billion by the end of 1994 , leaving De Beers with an inventory greater than its yearly sales , which stood at $ 4.37 billion in 1993 .
But the CSO said that it 's in Russia 's interest to help stamp out the unauthorized diamond sales .
`` Confidence in the diamond market is based on the premise that the world 's major producers will cooperate to safeguard market stability through the singlechannel marketing system of the CSO , '' Mr. Ralfe said .
However , he recognizes that the leakage of Russian gems seems to contradict what he calls `` the fact of cooperation with all the Russian authorities .
'' He notes that the De Beers relationship with Russia dates back to the 1950s and has withstood various pressures -- not least the need to disguise the marketing arrangements between 1960-1990 because of Soviet sensitivities about being seen to cooperate with De Beers during the period of apartheid .
De Beers starts the third round of talks with the Russian authorities in September , aimed at reworking the five-year accord that expires next year .
The 1990 agreement gives De Beers the right to market 95 % of Russia 's rough-gem output destined for export , with 5 % sold directly by the Russians .
In return , De Beers lent $ 1 billion to the Soviet government in 1990 , repayable in five years and secured by a shipment of diamonds .
As well as the unauthorized sales , Mr. Ralfe is concerned about the large stockpile of diamonds held within Russia -- an estimated $ 4 billion to $ 8 billion inventory of often high-quality gems , which Russia established for strategic reasons .
And Mr. Ralfe notes that Russian diamond output may rise substantially when new Siberian mines begin production .
`` Why is Russia so important to De Beers ?
The most important fact is that while De Beers supplies 50 % of the world 's gem diamonds , Russia has the capacity -- I use that word advisedly -- to produce up to 25 % , '' Mr. Ralfe said .
The Udachnaya mines in the Siberian province of Sakha currently supply 80 % of Russian gems , but there have been delays in bringing other mines into production .
Mir , the country 's first mine , is inactive pending new capital investment to tap its deep reserves , and the new Jubilee mine is three years behind its planned opening as a result of equipment and funding problems .
Mr. Ralfe is confident Russia knows a sound relationship with De Beers is in its `` national interest , '' noting the high-powered delegation put together by Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin for the diamond talks .
The team includes Yevgeny Bychkov , head of the State Committee for Gemstones and Precious Metals -LRB- Komdragmet -RRB- ; Finance Minister Sergei Dubinin , and Foreign Economic Relations Ministry representatives .
One leading South African diamond analyst is also optimistic .
`` I am convinced the Russians need De Beers as much as De Beers needs them .
'' Negotiations will lead to a win-win outcome , even if De Beers wins less than the Russians , he said .
Meanwhile , the CSO faces the challenge of a surge in Canadian diamond supply over which it has no control yet .
Analysts believe the planned mine near Lac de Gras , in which Australia 's Broken Hill Proprietary Co. has a stake , will come on stream in 1997 or 1998 , producing high-quality gems of the sort available from Russia .
De Beers plays down suggestions about a surge of output from Canada , noting that its own studies on the mineral formations in the area were unpromising .
But Credit Lyonnais Laing 's Mr. Coulson said the recent withdrawal of Kennecott Mining , the U.S. subsidiary of the U.K. 's RTZ Corp. , from one Canadian exploration venture does n't necessarily support De Beers 's suggestion that Canada 's diamond resources are limited .
He noted that De Beers has bought ground near Lac de Gras hoping for a similar source of high-quality gems .
DALLAS -- Hoping to avoid a proxy battle with its largest shareholder , Greyhound Lines Inc. offered Connor , Clark & Co. two seats on its nine-member board and a role in selecting its new chief executive officer .
The bus company said the closely held Canadian investment concern , which holds an 18.3 % Greyhound stake , could select one director immediately and propose three additional candidates , one of whom would be appointed after Greyhound names a new chief executive .
Connor Clark could also be `` actively involved '' in the executive search .
In return , however , Toronto-based Connor Clark would have to agree , through Greyhound 's 1996 annual shareholders meeting , not to press for additional board or management changes , make public statements about the company or contact current or former Greyhound directors , employees and suppliers .
In making the offer , Charles A. Lynch , Greyhound 's chairman , said that , `` the expense and disruption of a proxy fight at this time would have disastrous economic consequences for Greyhound , Connor Clark and other Greyhound shareholders .
'' Connor Clark executives could n't be reached for comment on the proposal , which was disclosed yesterday .
Frank Schmieder resigned as Greyhound president , chief executive and director on Aug. 9 , after Connor Clark sought his departure and as many as three board seats .
The moves came after Greyhound announced that it would substantially cut back its route system and lay off as much as 10 % of its work force in a bid to regain profitability .
As reported , 50-year-old Thomas Plaskett , a company director and former chairman and chief executive of defunct airline company Pan Am Corp. , is serving as interim Greyhound president and chief executive .
Mr. Plaskett has said , however , that he does n't intend to seek the posts permanently .
Battered by stiff competition from low airfares , Greyhound reported a second-quarter loss of $ 45.4 million , or $ 3.10 a share , compared with net income of $ 5.6 million , or 33 cents a share , for the year-earlier period .
Revenue fell 9.7 % to $ 151 million from $ 167.2 million .
ELGIN , Ill. -- Safety-Kleen Corp. said a unit agreed to pay $ 1.9 million to settle a three-year government investigation into the handling of used oil at a Buffalo , N.Y. , site .
Safety-Kleen , which denied any wrongdoing , said the settlement wo n't have any impact on its operating results .
The recycler of automotive and industrial fluids said it settled with the government to , among other things , avoid costly litigation .
The government was investigating whether used oil that was processed from 1989 to 1991 at a Booth Oil Co. site in Buffalo was properly tested for hazardous residues .
Booth Oil is n't owned by Safety-Kleen , but a unit used the facility for the processing of used oil and oily water .
As part of the settlement with New York state and the U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York , Safety-Kleen said it agreed to buy the Buffalo site from closely held Booth Oil for $ 2.4 million , and to install new management within 15 days .
In the mid - '80s , some Japanese Defense Agency officials seeking to increase their budget resurrected decade-old plans to build a fighter plane , a model called the FS-X .
Their promise that this plane would be the most advanced aircraft of the century was enough to give them the multibillion-dollar funding they wanted .
That Japan was unable to build such a plane was a trivial matter , since what was at stake was money , not security .
Big contractors such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries salivated at all the easy yen coming their way .
On the other side of the Pacific , however , the U.S. Defense Department sensed a big loss of dollars for firms that had been selling American fighter planes to Japan .
Jeff Shear 's `` The Keys to the Kingdom : The FS-X Deal and the Selling of America 's Future to Japan '' -LRB- Doubleday , 318 pages , $ 23.95 -RRB- tells what happened next in two parts : the frantic haggling in 1986 and 1987 as the Americans got in on the deals , and the political explosion following congressional debate over whether the U.S. was selling off key technology from its `` industrial base '' to a potential competitor in commercial aviation .
As is common in journalistic efforts of this kind , the tale is told as the clash of personalities .
Dynamic , jut-jawed Americans come up against wily samurai , and the samurai are about to win when the day is saved by flag-waving defenders of the `` American Dream '' -LRB- this is the term the book frequently uses -RRB- who alert Jesse Helms to the dangers of technology transfer .
Sens. Helms , John Danforth and Jeff Bingaman sound the charge , and the FS-X deal soon lies trampled , barely alive .
Up to a point the dramatizing is enjoyable , as it enlivens a complex narrative of bureaucrats at play .
But I did wonder here and there when genuinely dull -LRB- but quite nice -RRB- people I know myself were portrayed as sinister apologists for Japan .
Such peeks behind closed doors of power usually serve as harmless fun for policy wonks , but Mr. Shear , in making Clyde Prestowitz and his associates the alarm-sounding heroes of the book , gives us a useful look at the ideology of those whom I call the New Mercantilists .
In bits and pieces the book reveals their beliefs : -- U.S. dominance in high-tech industries would somehow lead to increased exporting and reduced importing , and thus `` the jobs people needed to reach for the American Dream .
'' -- In the 17th century mercantilists believed that a trade surplus would create wealth in the form of gold ; today wealth is created by piling up high-paying jobs .
-- Military security needs `` economic security '' -- manufacturing dominance .
-- Any military cooperation that transfers important technology is short-sighted and threatens to shift the international balance of economic security .
-- Japan is a country ruled by economic warriors who have organized institutions and people so that the efficiency of management has replaced the messiness of markets , yielding an economic engine of nearly overwhelming global force .
Thus do the New Mercantilists conclude that the direst threat to U.S. security is not Russia , China or North Korea -- but Japan .
To have any hope of winning the `` economic struggle '' and saving the American Dream , Mr. Shear argues , the U.S. must heed the advice of strategic traders .
-LRB- `` The Keys to the Kingdom '' does not get into it , but strategic traders believe that the U.S. must demand allocated shares of key Japanese markets so American companies can gain economies of scale through increased export volumes and thus the increased cash flow to generate research innovations .
-RRB- The New Mercantilists ' vision makes very little sense ; the idea of `` economic struggle '' as the nature of global competition defies reality .
Productivity , rather than market dominance and job growth , is the source of economic security .
Jobs can not be piled up like gold .
And those are America 's customers out there in the Pacific ; no trade is going to occur except win-win transactions .
What 's more , countries do n't compete in most business , businesses do .
What really counts is firm profitability , and this results from cleverness within a system of reasonably free competition .
Japan 's people now know this and want very much to demolish the Japan , Inc. , model that keeps holding down their standard of living .
Since the mid - '80s the FS-X deal has picked itself up and plodded on .
General Electric is doing the engine and General Dynamics is helping Mitsubishi Heavy Industries with the design .
Lockheed is doing the wing , and Mitsubishi Electric will sell radar technology to U.S. firms .
Budgets have shrunk , and the plane will not be the super-duper model first proposed .
No one in Japan is talking of aerospace leadership , and the New Mercantilists are sulking .
That 's business .

When Bonnie Dunn , 20 years old , tried out for a teller 's job at Great Western Bank in Chatsworth , Calif. , she faced a lineup of big jerks .
One young woman sputtered contradictory instructions about depositing a check , then blew her top when the transaction was n't handled fast enough .
Another customer had an even shorter fuse .
`` You people are unbelievably slow , '' he said .
Both tough customers appeared on a computer screen , as part of a 20-minute automated job interview .
Ms. Dunn was seated in front of a PC , coping via a color touch-screen and a microphone .
She was tested on making change and sales skills , as well as keeping cool in tense situations .
Great Western says the test reveals more about applicants than a traditional job interview can .
Those who perform well are ushered into a manager 's office for a face-to-face talk .
Ms. Dunn stayed calm and landed the job .
`` Everyone goes through the same thing , '' so it 's fairer to applicants , says Michele Maddock , a Great Western vice president who spearheaded the project .
And it 's more efficient for managers , bank officials say , because the computer weeds out underqualified people .
Frederick Gray , manager of Great Western 's Northridge , Calif. , branch says that each month he used to interview as many as a dozen applicants for at least 15 minutes each .
`` Four in 10 would be an absolute , total waste of time , '' he says .
Because the computer is so selective , it reduces high turnover among tellers , who start at $ 4.50 an hour , thus saving both managers and trainers time , bank officials say .
Of course , being interviewed by a computer strikes some weary job hunters as even more depersonalizing than a regular job interview .
Even Ms. Dunn , who passed her automated interview with flying colors , has doubts .
Computers ca n't `` see how you actually are and get what other qualities you have , '' she says .
But job applicants had better get used to making their best impressions on computer terminals .
Computerized job tests developed by Wyoming-based Aspen Tree Software Inc. , Utah-based Park City Group Inc. and others already are in use for entry-level workers at a number of big companies such as Neiman Marcus , some Marriott hotels and Walt Disney Co. .
Applicants are often more honest with computers than they would be with people , presumably because computers are not judgmental .
And the computers , in turn , can be sneaky .
`` If an applicant takes longer than average to answer a question like ` Have you ever been terminated for stealing ?
' '' the computer will tell a human interviewer to probe more deeply , says Brooks Mitchell , Aspen Tree 's president .
Computer interviewing is proliferating , says David Mitcham , a human resources executive at Ball Corp. , Muncie , Ind. , and chairman of a national employers ' group .
`` Establishing a warm-and-fuzzy feeling about the company '' does n't make sense anymore because `` working for a company for your whole career is gone .
'' Learning Systems Sciences , a North Hollywood , Calif. , producer of multimedia training systems , developed Great Western 's program last year for more than $ 50,000 .
After months of testing , the bank installed the system throughout Florida and now is putting it in California branches .
Great Western executives say that people hired by the program were 26 % less likely to quit or be fired within 90 days of hiring .
The computer tells applicants what the job really involves , something a candidate might be reluctant to ask a person for fear of appearing negative .
When applicants sit down facing the computer at Great Western 's bank branches , they hear it say , `` Welcome to the interactive assessment aid .
'' The computer does n't understand what applicants say , although it records their comments to be evaluated later .
To begin the interview , applicants touch a label on the screen , eliciting an ominous foreword : `` We 'll be keeping track of how long it takes you and how many mistakes you make .
Accuracy is more important than speed .
'' First the computer tests the applicant on money skills , asking her to cash a check for $ 192.18 , including at least three $ 5 bills and $ 2 in quarters .
Then , when an angry customer appears on the screen , candidates are expected to grab the microphone and mollify him .
Later , a bank official who listens to the recorded interviews gives applicants five points for maintaining a friendly tone of voice , plus up to 15 points for apologizing , promising to solve the customer 's problem , and , taking a cue from the screen , suggesting that in the future he use the bank 's deposits-only line .
The touchy young woman is tougher .
Speaking rapidly , she says she wants to cash a $ 150 check , get $ 40 in cash and put $ 65 in savings and the rest in checking .
As an applicant struggles to sort that out , she quickly adds , `` No , it has to be $ 50 in checking because I just wrote a check this morning .
'' If the applicant touches a label on the screen that says '' ?
'' the woman fumes , `` How many times do I have to tell you ?
I thought I wanted $ 40 in cash but that does n't matter but I have to put $ 50 in the checking account and the rest in savings .
'' Dare to request another repeat and her temper tantrum worsens .
Applicants who have to ask her to repeat a fourth time lose points .
They 're also docked if they do n't put $ 50 in the woman 's checking account .
In an interview by the computer , this reporter lost points for taking too long on the math and money section and for failing to list benefits of Great Western 's checking accounts .
But after noting the score -- 75 out of 85 points -- Mr. Gray , the Great Western branch manager , is optimistic : `` If the newspaper job does n't work out , come talk to me .
'' WASHINGTON -- The government 's budget deficit narrowed to $ 33.20 billion in July from $ 39.58 billion a year earlier , the Treasury said .
The government had a revised surplus of $ 14.85 billion in June .
So far , the country is on pace for a smaller deficit this fiscal year than last .
For the first 10 months of fiscal 1994 , which ends Sept. 30 , the deficit was $ 183.64 billion , compared with $ 240.75 billion for the first 10 months of fiscal 1993 .
The deficit for all of fiscal 1993 was $ 255.26 billion .
In its monthly statement , the Treasury said receipts totaled $ 84.83 billion last month , compared with $ 80.63 billion a year earlier and $ 138.12 billion in June .
Outlays totaled $ 118.03 billion in July , down from $ 120.21 billion a year earlier and $ 123.28 billion in June .

MINNEAPOLIS -- General Mills Inc. has begun dumping boxes of cereal containing traces of unauthorized pesticide after searching for alternate uses , including animal feed .
Boxes are being hauled to landfills in Illinois , Pennsylvania and Utah to make room for new production at several plants , a company spokesman said yesterday .
About 50 million boxes of cereal , including the company 's best-selling Cheerios brand , were quarantined after it was discovered that an independent contractor had used the wrong pesticide on oats .
The contractor has since been indicted on felony charges .
He has been accused of deliberately using a cheaper pesticide but billing the company for the more expensive , approved spray .
Government authorities have said the cereals presented no apparent health hazard , but the company suspended their production in June when federal authorities discovered samples of the pesticide in some boxes .
It later became evident that millions of boxes had been sold to consumers for months before the misapplication was discovered .
General Mills estimates it will take a charge of about $ 88 million , or 55 cents a share , to cover costs associated with the incident .
A class-action lawsuit has been filed in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago over the incident .
General Mills has termed the suit without merit because both the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency said no health hazard was posed .
Goulds Pumps Inc. said it 's moving its corporate headquarters to the Rochester , N.Y. , area as soon as a site can be located .

HONG KONG -- Mention Asian telecommunications stocks and fund managers respond : `` Too expensive .
'' But maybe not for long .
Investors prepared to wait a few months may see new buying opportunities in the telecommunications sector .
A planned flood of new telecom-company stock during the next three years could well swamp the markets , forcing down prices for new issues and existing shares .
Telecom stocks can give international investors an easy route into many highgrowth Asian markets .
With only 57.3 million lines last year , or 3.4 lines for every 100 people in East and Southeast Asia , potential for growth abounds .
Salomon Brothers Hong Kong Ltd. sees the number of lines in the region rising to 158.8 million by the year 2000 , or 9.8 lines per 100 inhabitants .
The hang-up is the price .
Many AsianPacific telecom stocks trade on high price\/earnings multiples and at a premium to their domestic stock markets .
However , as more and more of the region 's telecom companies seek to list their shares and raise capital , investors will be betterplaced to pick and choose the best value .
Asian-Pacific telecom companies are likely to hit the markets with $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion of international equity offerings each year for the next three years , as they race to upgrade their networks and finance ambitious expansion plans , said Andrew Harrington , vice president and senior analyst at Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong .
To put that in perspective , Asian companies -- from all types of industry -- raised a total of $ 13.1 billion from international equity and equity-linked issues in 1993 , according to figures compiled by IFR Securities Data .
`` Investors will have a range of different countries , regulatory environments and types of telecom company to choose from , '' said Dr. Harrington , who estimates that by 1996 , investors will be able to dabble in as many as 50 quoted telecom companies in the region .
On the horizon is an initial public offering from PT Indosat , Indonesia 's international carrier .
The company , which is seeking a listing on the New York Stock Exchange , is expected to raise as much as $ 1 billion globally , possibly as early as October .
Also expected in 1994 are convertible-bond offerings from companies including Telekom Malaysia Bhd. , Technology Resources Industries Bhd. of Malaysia and possibly , Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. .
`` There is so much new issuance that you will see investors buying the telecom stocks which are cheap internationally -- that 's to say , cheap relative to other telecom companies -- and not just because they look cheap relative to their domestic markets , '' Dr. Harrington said .
To succeed , new issues will have to be `` priced to go , '' he adds .
A rerating of telecom stocks may mean the end of deals such as Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. 's partial privatization last November .
At an offering price of 3.60 Singapore dollars -LRB- US$ 2.39 -RRB- , equivalent to 49 times 1993 earnings , the sale raised eyebrows .
`` Singapore Telecom could be regarded as the culmination of the emerging-markets mania , '' said Gavin Graham , senior investment officer at Citibank Global Asset Management -LRB- Asia -RRB- Ltd. in Hong Kong .
`` Well done to the Singapore government for getting it away at that price .
It was priced at over 40 times earnings and as such was a remarkable achievement , but it wo n't be repeated .
'' Needless to say , Mr. Graham 's portfolio for institutional investors is bare of Singapore Telecom .
Pricing again topped the agenda when India 's Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd. tried to get a $ 1 billion offering of global depositary receipts off the ground earlier this year .
International investors balked at the indicated offer price of 1,400 rupees to 1,600 rupees -LRB- $ 44.96 to $ 51.38 -RRB- , especially when set against a background of faltering world financial markets .
At 1,500 rupees , the middle of the indicated price range , that valued VSNL stock at a staggering 85 times estimated 1994 per-share earnings .
The P\/E ratio would have fallen to 41 times estimated earnings in 1995 .
Both VSNL and the offering 's global coordinators -- Kleinwort Benson Securities and Salomon Brothers International Ltd. -- realized that investors would only bite if the price was dropped to between 1,100 rupees and 1,200 rupees .
But the Indian government could n't stomach selling the family silver at that level , and the deal was pulled at the 11th hour .
VSNL looms large in the minds of many investment bankers and fund managers .
The issue 's global coordinators hope the deal will go ahead this year , though its structure and pricing remain under discussion .
Even at the lower price range , VSNL would be raising $ 650 million to $ 700 million from investors .
International investors who want exposure to the Asian-Pacific telecom sector should stick to PLDT , Telecom Corp. of New Zealand and Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. , Dr. Harrington said .
These are the most attractively priced on an international comparison of telecom stocks , he said ; he sees little to justify prices for stocks such as Singapore Telecom and Thailand 's telecom companies .
An aversion to the high prices commanded by telecom stocks has kept Regent Fund Management Ltd. of Hong Kong well away from the sector .
`` Sure , the growth prospects are there , but the prices reflect that and I feel the earnings will take a long time to show through , '' said James Chirnside , senior fund manager at Regent .
`` It 's an exciting theme , granted , but at the right price .
'' AUSTIN , Texas -- Dell Computer Corp. is expected to announce today an overhaul of its high-end OptiPlex line of corporate desktop computers that will include price cuts and the introduction of high-performance Pentium microprocessors .
The computer vendor said it would break a price barrier by offering for under $ 3,000 a fully configured desktop system based on a speedy 90-megahertz version of Intel Corp. 's Pentium chip .
`` We are moving toward Pentium carrying over into the corporate side , '' said Doug MacGregor , Dell 's vice president for desktop computers .
`` None of our corporate customers have a question of whether or not they 'll use Pentium .
It 's a question of when .
'' Dell has pushed hard with the newest Intel chip , and now more than half of all Dimension machines sold to home users and small businesses use Pentium chips , Mr. MacGregor said .
But corporate customers have been waiting for Pentium prices to fall , he said .
With the new Optiplex prices , businesses will be able to buy Pentium-based machines at prices similar to what they were paying less than a year ago for slower 486-based computers , Mr. MacGregor said .
Dell said its new OptiPlex models replace machines introduced about one year ago .
The new machines incorporate advanced power management , enhanced networking capabilities and easier-to-use `` plug ` n ' play '' features .
A Texas court judge awarded $ 123.6 million to a Dallas investor who accused Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. and its former vice chairman , Scott A. Beck , of breach of fiduciary duty .
The judge ordered Blockbuster ; Video Superstores Master L.P. , which was acquired by Blockbuster ; and Mr. Beck each to pay the plaintiff $ 36.3 million in punitive damages .
The three defendants also were ordered to pay a total of $ 14.7 million in actual damages and interest .
Mr. Beck is currently chairman and chief executive officer of Boston Chicken Inc. , which is n't a party to this lawsuit .
The case stems from a 1991 lawsuit filed by Charles D. Howell , who was an investor in a limited partnership formed in 1986 by Mr. Beck to own and operate video rental stores in the then-fledgling Blockbuster chain .
Three years later , Mr. Beck sold his interest in the partnerships to Blockbuster in a transaction valued at more than $ 110 million , according to the lawsuit , which alleged that the limited partnership investors did n't approve that transaction .
Further , Mr. Howell 's suit alleged that the limited partnership interests were n't acquired by Blockbuster until two years later .
G. Michael Gruber , the attorney for Mr. Howell , said he is pleased with the judge 's decision .
A Blockbuster spokesman said the video rental and music retailer based in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , will appeal the verdict .
He also said he does n't know how or when Blockbuster will account for the judgment in its financial results .
Mr. Beck could n't be reached for comment .

Gasoline prices may be poised for significant gains , as refiners start adjusting output to meet new environmental standards by 1995 .
The Clean Air Act dictates gasoline sold in the nation 's nine smoggiest cities must be blended , or reformulated , with ethanol and other oxygenates to reduce pollutants by the beginning of January .
This process alone is expected to add an average of five cents to seven cents a gallon to prices in those markets -- which together make up one-third of the 7.5 million barrels of gasoline guzzled daily by U.S. vehicles .
Other costs associated with meeting the air-quality standards could boost gasoline prices another seven cents to nine cents a gallon .
And some analysts predict that higher prices of crude oil , the raw material from which gasoline is made , could push gasoline higher still .
Meanwhile , as the industry copes with making , testing and distributing the new gasoline , `` there could be some localized spot shortages , or dislocations , '' says Charles Heath , who tracks petroleum supplies for the U.S. Energy Department in Washington .
The bottom line : `` The low disinflationary gasoline prices of the first half of this year are gone , '' says Lawrence Goldstein , president of Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York .
`` The good news is now behind us .
'' Prices of gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rallied sharply in June and July , but fell back in recent weeks , in line with the price of crude oil .
Last week , prices spiked up on fears that a tropical storm in the Caribbean area might hit refineries there and along the Gulf of Mexico .
But by Friday morning , the storm was heading out into the Atlantic Ocean and gasoline prices tumbled .
Unleaded regular gasoline for September delivery fell 2.26 cents Friday to end the week at 54.20 cents a gallon .
That 's down from about 60 cents a gallon in early August , but is still more than four cents above its levels of early June .
The exchange , which currently trades nonreformulated gasoline , expects to adjust its contract to meet the new reformulated specifications .
In contrast to the futures market 's volatility , prices at the pump have been rather docile , allowing U.S. motorists to enjoy fairly cheap driving for most of the summer .
But that 's changing : The price for regular unleaded self-serve , the nation 's biggest-selling gasoline , jumped by 3.5 cents to $ 1.17 a gallon during the two weeks ended Aug. 5 , according to a recent survey by Lundberg Survey Inc. , based in North Hollywood , Calif. .
A survey completed yesterday shows the price increased by 1.13 cents to $ 1.18 a gallon for the two weeks ended Friday , less than one-third the rate of increase noted during the previous survey .
As costs related to the new environmental standards begin to kick in , industry analysts speculate that many drivers soon will have to dig even deeper into their pockets when they fill their tanks .
Mr. Heath of the Energy Department figures that refineries will have to start manufacturing the new , cleaner fuel as early as next month and inventories will start to build by October .
To meet the deadline , service stations will need to have it on hand by December .
Each domestic refiner bound by the new standards must reduce the amount of toxins contained in its gasoline by 15 % from that refinery 's average levels of 1990 .
But areas heavily dependent on imported gasoline , such as the highly populated Northeast , face an even bigger challenge .
That 's because the rules , in effect , set an even tougher standard for foreign refiners -- one that many imports wo n't meet .
Why 's that ?
Foreign refiners must comply with a 1990 baseline average of all U.S. refiners .
And since that national average includes extremely green-minded West Coast refiners , it 's a `` more stringent '' requirement than many foreign refiners are used to , says Philip Verleger , oil economist for Charles River Associates Inc. in Washington .
As a result , a minimum of 13 % of the approximate 400,000 barrels of gasoline imported each day along the East Coast could be barred from the market , analysts say .
Venezuelan and Brazilian supplies will be hit especially hard , Mr. Verleger says .
To make up the difference , the Northeast will have to ship in reformulated gasoline from U.S. refineries in the Gulf of Mexico .
And those extra transportation costs could add significantly to prices .
What 's more , the air-quality standards dictate that ethanol , in addition to other oxygenates , must be used in the new gasoline mix -- which will further increase costs , since ethanol supplies will have to be trucked in from the Midwest .
Oil-industry and federal and state officials have been holding meetings trying to sort out all the probable complications .
A report outlining the potential difficulties -- and their likely effect on prices -- will be turned over to John Dingell , head of the powerful House Energy Committee , by early October .
Of particular concern , the report is expected to note , is the potential loss of imports .
Another wild card in the gasoline outlook is the price of crude oil .
Many analysts think oil prices could weaken somewhat in the near term , but they believe the tightening supply-demand picture is likely to buoy prices by year 's end .
As maintenance of North Sea oil field winds to a close over the next few weeks , that should free up new supplies of crude oil and keep a lid on prices .
And even as the flow of that crude increases , European demand should temporarily weaken as refineries begin their own maintenance programs next month .
`` Demand in Europe for crude might drop by as much as 500,000 barrels a day for a while , '' says Ann-Louise Hittle , crude-oil analyst for Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Cambridge , Mass. .
However , by the fourth quarter , global demand for crude is expected to outstrip production , pushing prices as high as $ 20 a barrel by the end of the year , analysts say .
Charles River 's Mr. Verleger projects that as world economies pick up , there will be a need for 70.1 million barrels of crude daily , while production will total 68.4 million barrels a day during the fourth quarter .
LIVESTOCK & MEATS : Cattle-futures prices might weaken at the open of trading today at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the wake of a monthly government feedlot survey .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported after the close of trading Friday that it counted 7.37 million cattle on feedlots in the seven major ranch states Aug. 1 , down 3 % from a year earlier .
Some traders had expected a bigger drop in the population on feedlots , which fatten cattle on rich grain rations for slaughter .
According to the monthly survey , ranchers placed 1.53 million cattle onto feedlots in the seven states during July , up 2 % from a year earlier .
The feedlots sold 1.65 million cattle to meatpackers in July , down 2 % from a year earlier .
TORONTO -- The Ontario Securities Commission ruled that Lac Minerals Ltd. not be allowed to trigger its shareholder-rights plan if two-thirds of Lac 's shareholders tender their shares to either of two takeover bids for the company .
Lac , a Toronto gold producer , is the target of takeover bids from Royal Oak Mines Inc. , Vancouver , British Columbia , and American Barrick Resources Corp. , Toronto .
The bidders asked the commission to block Lac 's rights plan , which could make the cost of a takeover of Lac prohibitively expensive .
Also , the plan made Lac 's shareholders reluctant to tender their shares to either bid because of uncertainty about the plan , the bidders said .
Royal Oak 's offer for Lac expires tomorrow and Barrick 's offer expires Friday .
Among the bids ' other conditions , they require that two-thirds of holders tender shares .
Lac Chairman James Pitblado said during the commission 's two-day hearing that Lac is in discussions with other parties regarding a potential new option for Lac shareholders .
He declined to provide details and declined to say if a new option will be announced this week .
The commission did n't make a ruling on Lac 's rights plan in the event that neither bid is successful , but said `` as time goes on , it will be more difficult to persuade us that the plan has any potential utility or proper purpose .
'' NEW YORK -- Moody 's Investors Service , citing Sears , Roebuck & Co. 's improving profitability , placed about $ 11 billion of the big retailer 's debt under review for possible upgrade .
The rating concern said the potentially positive review was sparked by Sears 's `` enhanced financial performance , '' which Moody 's attributed both to industrywide factors and to corporate strategies that the Chicago concern has undertaken .
The review will `` focus on Sears 's ability to sustain its improved performance , '' Moody 's said `` including the company 's ability to maintain gross margins and continue to reduce costs .
'' The rating concern said it will also consider the risks and `` potential volatility '' for earnings and cash flow linked to competition and to potential catastrophe-loss exposure related to Sears 's remaining 80 % stake in insurer Allstate Corp. .
Allstate was formerly a wholly owned Sears unit , but was taken public through an initial offering last year .
That offering was part of a corporate makeover in which Sears shed a number of operations in order to focus on its merchandise and insurance businesses .
The ratings Moody 's placed under review for possible upgrade include Sears 's Baa-1-rated senior debt and its Baa-2-rated preferred stock .
Among the issues not covered in the review are Allstate 's single-A-2 senior debt and the double-A-3 financial strength rating of its Allstate Insurance Co. unit .
Sears Roebuck Acceptance Corp. 's commercial paper , currently rated Prime-2 , is also not scheduled for the review .
As the Japanese once again rehash World War II in this 50th anniversary year of the conflict 's closing chapters , the pattern is familiar .
Tokyo presents a remorseful face to Asia , as it should , in atonement for Japanese atrocities .
But it also presents a nobler interpretation of its war aims and victimhood for domestic consumption .
One theme : The U.S. atom bombings were far worse than any of the savagery of the Imperial Army .
This issue has profound resonance for Japan as it goes into the post Cold War future .
No particular moral sheen attaches to Japan for being the world 's only A-bombing victim .
Bombing civilians is not an ennobling way to fight even the most just of wars , to be sure .
But the conventional and atomic bombings of civilian centers also reflected a legitimate desire to avoid losses of U.S. troops , using the only means afforded by the technology of the day .
Today , questions of military appropriateness are again before us .
An article by Duncan Lennox in Jane 's Defense Weekly of July 16 , reports that there are 13,450 ballistic missiles in service in 34 countries today .
Further , there are `` around 30 new types in development and a potential for more countries to obtain ballistic missiles in the near future .
'' It seems unlikely , that all the new missile states , some of whom have or will soon get nuclear warheads , can be counted on to behave rationally .
In any case , the mere possession of such weapons by an adversary can dangerously constrain the choices open to statesmen in a democratic society .
There is thus the question of how best to defend against missiles .
Japan has reached this crossroads today because of North Korea .
But also because in the longer run Japan is rich , potentially a superpower and has unilaterally renounced the option of nuclear deterrence .
Yet it would be folly to suppose that voters in a democratic Japan will forever consent to remaining defenseless against a world of proliferating threats .
How Japan goes about defending itself will shape Asia 's security for decades to come .
We learn , again from Jane 's , that the U.S. has presented Japan with a series of options for cooperating on ballistic missile defenses .
A cheap defensive system would rely on upgraded Patriot missiles , similar to those that battled incoming Scuds in the Gulf War .
Coupled with a small fleet of Aegis destroyers , which would take on the same missiles farther out , this system might be sufficient for the relatively small number of primitive missiles the North Koreans could throw across the Sea of Japan .
Other , more expensive options would give Japan an apparatus capable of handling more missiles from a variety of directions .
If effective , such a system would be able to knock down not just North Korea 's rogue missiles , but would also begin to affect Asia 's strategic equation with respect to China .
These options would require Japan to chip in for the development of the Theater High Altitude Air Defense system , or THAAD , now progressing toward field trials in the U.S. Space-based defenses would probably prove more effective still , but the Clinton administration is dragging its feet on this technology .
There is a danger in Japan pinning these questions too much to the North Korean threat , which could disappear in a puff of reunification .
China poses a more permanent challenge and inevitably regards Japan as a strategic competitor .
Japan 's economic might and its military vulnerability ought to persuade anybody that it wo n't always be a passive spectator to Asia 's strategic currents .
Other Asian countries are already watching closely to see if Japanese power can serve as a check on Chinese ambitions .
A Japan that takes its own military security seriously can play a good and desirable role .
The real question , then , is what kind of superpower Japan should become .
Japan 's view of itself and Asia 's hopes would both be served best if it became a defensive superpower .
That means employing strategic defenses to secure the homefront from nuclear blackmail or attack while building conventional forces that can contribute to the common goal of keeping China from setting itself up as the arbiter of the South China Sea and neighboring waters .
Before that can happen , Japan will have to unburden itself of its World War II neuroses .
The war was a misguided and failed attempt to find security in imperial control over other peoples .
That does not mean that it is wrong for Japan to be secure , or to contribute to the security of its neighbors .
Other countries recognize Japan 's potential military power and are planning accordingly .
So must Japan if it wants to contribute to a peaceful future for Asia .
BankAmerica Corp. said a California judge upheld its system for resolving disputes with customers through arbitration .
The bank , based in San Francisco , was sued in August 1992 by the California Trial Lawyers Association , Consumer Action and others .
They argue that arbitration robs consumers of protections available in conventional lawsuits , such as the ability to compel release of company documents and join with other plaintiffs in classaction suits .
BankAmerica said its `` alternative dispute resolution system '' for deposit and credit-card accounts was upheld in a verbal ruling by Superior Court Judge Thomas Mellon .

RAMSAY HEALTH CARE Inc. -LRB- New Orleans -RRB- -- Jack V. Eumont Jr. will resign for personal reasons as chief financial officer of this psychiatric services company , effective Sept. 30 .
Ramsay said Mr. Eumont 's duties will be assumed by other members of management .
TAIPEI , Taiwan -- Taiwan 's Investment Commission on Friday approved the $ 6 million investment plan of Evergreen Group , the largest container shipping operator in the world , to build a container depot in Shanghai , China , officials said .
The project , Evergreen 's first venture in China , marks the beginning of a series of investment plans in the mainland aiming at possible direct shipping links across the Taiwan Straits .
The Taiwanese company has proposed to invest a total of $ 80 million to set up docks , container terminals , trucking firms and other facilities in China .
Under plans approved in shareholders ' meetings in May , Evergreen Marine Corp. , the core member of the group , will invest $ 50 million in China for operations in Shanghai and other cities through Peony Investment SA , the group 's subsidiary in Panama .
Uniglory Marine Corp. , another member of the Evergreen Group , will invest $ 30 million in major Chinese ports such as Guangzhou , Qingdao and Tianjin .
Carlos Lin , a spokesman for Evergreen Marine Corp. , said investment in China is necessary to keep the competitive edge of the shipping group .
`` We are lagging behind other major shippers in investing in China , '' he said .
Mr. Lin declined to elaborate on the group 's long-term goals in China .
Nevertheless , analysts have said the Evergreen Group has taken a bold move to challenge Taiwan 's ban on direct shipping links with China .
The Nationalist government , which fled to this island in 1949 after losing a civil war to Chinese Communists , still bans direct air and sea links with China , though indirect trade has boomed while political tensions have eased in recent years .
`` Evergreen Group has taken the right move to maintain its leadership in shipping business , '' said David Chio , a shipping analyst for HG Asia Securities Taiwan Ltd. .
He noted that Evergreen will be excluded from the China market if it does n't catch up with other shippers that already offer services to China , especially the fast-growing route between Japan and the mainland .
In a recent interview with a local magazine , Evergreen Group 's chairman , Y.F. Chang , expressed strong desire to compete with other shippers for China-related routes despite the lack of direct shipping links between Taiwan and China .
The shipping giant 's planned operations in China will also help many Taiwanese companies with investments in China , Mr. Chio said .
He said it is widely believed that Taiwan will soon lift the ban to allow shipping links with China , possibly before 1996 ; as the Ministry of Transportation reported earlier this year , it will review the technical aspects for direct shipping links .
Evergreen 's project was among the 31 investment projects worth a total of about $ 43 million approved Friday by the commission .
For the first half of this year , Taiwanese investments to China approved by the government totaled $ 434.7 million .
Evergreen Group has a total of 76 container ships .
The fleet will increase to 80 container ships with a total capacity of 180,000 TEUs -LRB- twenty-foot equivalent units -RRB- by the end of August 1995 .
On the Taiwan Stock Exchange , Evergreen Marine shares closed at $ 49.8 New Taiwanese dollars -LRB- US$ 1.88 -RRB- , up NT$ 1.7 .
Uniglory Marine shares finished up NT$ 2 to NT$ 49.6 .
A Russian government commission outlined measures to deal with burgeoning debts between companies .
The moves include tighter accounting standards and a push for coordinated price freezes .
The panel endorsed negotiations to freeze prices of fuels , electricity and some industrial products until debt reduction takes hold .
An order is to be drafted soon to tighten control of energy prices , which jumped 150 % this year through July , outpacing the 80 % rise in producer prices .
Since Russia began freeing prices in early 1992 , enterprises struggling to adjust supply and demand have built up huge debts to each other .
Many state-run firms ignore market needs and make unsalable products .
Outmoded heavy industry , such as energy-hungry metals plants , run months behind in paying workers and suppliers .
Without effective bankruptcy rules , creditors have little influence .
The government said such overdue debts on July 1 totaled $ 21 billion , but it has n't specified its calculations ; accuracy of official data is widely questioned .
India 's central bank relaxed foreign-exchange controls in line with the government 's market-reform program , moving closer to full convertibility of the rupee currency .
The Reserve Bank of India removed limits on the amount of rupees that may be converted to foreign currencies if the money is needed for travel abroad , education or medical treatment .
Indian nationals now may take only $ 2,000 a year out of the country .
Though the government has promised a full float of the rupee , it has moved cautiously because India 's foreign-exchange reserves have been low .
Japan 's population on March 31 totaled 124,322,801 , up 365,343 , or just 0.29 % , from a year earlier , marking the slowest growth on record , the Home Affairs Ministry said .
Women accounted for 50.9 % of the total and men 49.1 % .
Almost 49 % of Japan 's people live in the Tokyo , Nagoya and Osaka urban areas ; Tokyo remained Japan 's population leader at 11.6 million .
Nationally , household size averaged a record low 2.85 people , down from 2.88 last year .
The governor of China 's central bank appealed for tighter economic controls and said battling inflation is key to economic reforms .
Zhu Rongji , also the vice premier in charge of the economy , told People 's Bank of China branch managers that despite success in scaling back investment , the pace of construction is too fast .
Thus , he said credit must be strictly controlled in this year 's second half , the Xinhua news agency reported .
Mr. Zhu cited problems in state enterprises , such as excessive spending , price-gouging and disorder in finances and settling accounts .
Vietnam said it began drilling for oil in a disputed section of the South China Sea , where China in 1992 awarded rights to a U.S. company .
State-owned PetroVietnam in a joint venture with Russia is installing an exploratory well in the Tu Chinh field , 250 miles off the southern port of Vung Tau .
The project is part of Vietnam 's aggressive attempt to expand its fledgling oil and natural-gas industry with partners from Russia , the U.S. and Australia .
After years of harsh counterclaims , China and Vietnam said last week they wo n't let the dispute mar relations .
The Philippine government urged residents of a town 50 miles south of Manila to halt their protest against a Japanese-funded port project that will force about 1,500 families to move .
Japan is withholding money for the $ 50.7 million improvement of Batangas port until the dispute is resolved .
Residents -- the government calls them squatters -- say their families have lived in the area more than a century , even though many lack land titles .
The government said the port project would create thousands of jobs and benefit the area 's economy , as local exporters could bypass Manila 's congested port .
Singapore unveiled a `` court of the future '' with technology that a judge said could halve the time it takes to hear cases , save taxpayers money and protect children from having to testify in open court .
The project , named Court Vision 21 , has three objectives : paperless systems , instant transcription of evidence and testimony by video transmission .
A mock trial used video-conferencing , voice-recognition transcription systems , pen-based computing and multimedia applications .
Applying some of these techniques would require changes in the law ; for example , videotaped testimony is inadmissible in Singapore courts .
In the demonstration trial , specialized computer software allowed instant storage and retrieval of documents , evidence and exhibits in text , video , still-image and voice formats .
With Venezuela already reeling from a deepening economic crisis , the telephone company Cantv said it began cutting service to the government , which has n't paid phone bills totaling $ 88.5 million dating back to 1988 plus millions of dollars in finance charges ...

NEW YORK -- Last week 's dollar-selling was only a warm-up for the assault now gathering force , traders and analysts say .
Trade tensions , capital flows out of the U.S. , bond-market turmoil and inflation concerns will probably drive the dollar to new lows against the yen and 1994 lows against the mark , analysts say .
Sheer momentum will help .
The dollar 's short-lived rally on last week 's interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve reinforced market players ' perception that nothing can help the U.S. currency .
Late Friday in New York , the dollar traded at 1.5396 marks and 98.70 yen , down from 1.5515 marks and 100.15 yen at the end of the previous week .
About noon Monday in Tokyo , the dollar was trading at 1.5375 marks and at 98.45 yen ; sterling was at $ 1.5490 .
The dollar did n't benefit from the Fed 's rate increase because inflation remains a threat and would-be investors in U.S. assets know it , says Amy Smith , senior currency analyst at I.D.E.A. , a New York-based market analysis firm .
Credit growth , employment growth , increasing rates of capacity utilization , and industrial surveys such as the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank 's Business Outlook Survey all point to rising prices later in the year , Ms. Smith says .
By contrast , she notes , German prices are still falling and the Deutsche Bundesbank 's inflation-fighting credentials are unimpeachable .
`` Foreigners look at that , '' she says .
`` Germany is a more attractive place to keep money .
'' And although the Fed action also brought U.S. money-market rates within a fraction of a point of German rates , the long-awaited convergence is n't helping the dollar as much as market participants thought it might .
That 's partly because higher U.S. money-market rates , which make dollar-denominated assets more attractive to cash investors , have long since been factored into dollar-mark trading .
What 's worse for the dollar , many currency traders expect German monetary policy to reverse course as the German economy recovers .
Although some economists note that the export-dependent German recovery is a long way from warranting higher interest rates , traders are already looking far ahead .
`` The market 's taken the view that it 's just a matter of time before they start looking to the upside , '' says Michael Faust , who manages currency risk for San Mateo , Calif. , money managers Bailard , Biehl & Kaiser .
The mark is also benefiting from intraEuropean capital flows , analysts note .
Heavy selling in Italian and Swedish bonds in recent sessions has helped the mark in European cross-trading , they say .
`` Dollar weakness is partly a function of overall mark strength , '' says Marc Chandler , research director at Ezra Zask Associates , a Norfolk , Conn. , hedge fund .
Pressure on the dollar is likely to mount in September , analysts say .
The end of the month marks the deadline for the U.S. to identify countries believed to engage in unfair trade practices under the Super 301 trade measure .
If Japan is identified , as some analysts believe is likely , trade sanctions may be imposed .
September will also probably see Japanese repatriation of foreign assets ahead of the fiscal half-year , notes Ms. Smith of I.D.E.A. , further increasing demand for yen .
Finally , analysts say , disarray in the Clinton administration , although not an economic factor , intensifies market participants ' sour view of the dollar and of U.S. assets .
The dollar could easily sink to 1.5160 marks , the 1994 low set July 12 , analysts say .
If it falls through that level , traders will try to drive it below 1.50 marks .
The yen is expected to fall below its post-World War II low of 96.55 yen .
They 're back , passing stock tips at the shoeshine stand , buying securities on the basis of nothing more than hope and a whispered suggestion of a takeover .
They are the rumor mongers .
And they include everyone from small retail investors to the top traders on Wall Street .
Last week , takeover talk swirled about Mylan Laboratories Inc. , Quaker Oats Co. , H.J. Heinz Co. , Dr Pepper\/Seven-Up Cos. and LDDS Communications Inc. .
The week before , traders salivated over the suggestion that Glaxo Holdings PLC would buy Eli Lilly & Co. .
Never mind that Lilly could cost as much as $ 25 billion , rivaling the record $ 26.4 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1989 .
Lilly rose a couple of points and soared another $ 4.25 last week .
Some of the rumors wind up having a basis in fact and might even be tied to insider trading .
`` Whenever you have a major transaction , maintaining security is very difficult , '' says trial attorney Stanley Arkin , who has litigated several major insider-trading cases .
`` You have people who learn about things .
'' But other rumors seem destined to remain nothing but gossip .
Last week , a story made the rounds that Societe Generale , a big French insurer , planned to buy Continental Corp. .
But when Continental had a board meeting last week , the most dramatic news was less profitable for shareholders .
The company said it would eliminate its dividend .
The stock , which reached $ 20 a share last week , closed Friday at $ 16.875 .
`` The person who bought on the rumor is stuck in the mud , '' says Alan Ackerman , a market strategist at Reich & Co. `` It could be some time , if ever , before the story bears fruit .
'' Arbitragers , investors who make a living buying takeover stocks , say buying on rumors is a fool 's game .
Arbs wait until after an agreement is announced , and then capitalize on the difference between the market price and the deal price .
`` When you buy on a rumor , there 's no way to measure your risk and reward .
It 's not a business , '' says arbitrager Richard Nye .
Nevertheless , rumor buying accompanies any takeover wave and may have reached new heights in the merger boom of the 1980s .
But at least in the go-go '80s , there was some basis for the pretakeover speculation .
Large blocks of stock would often trade before a takeover bid , suggesting accumulation by a corporate raider .
These days , big companies are making the raids , and they might buy only a few thousand shares before making an offer .
The big buyers these days are the multitudes of investors trying to catch the next deal target before its stock price soars .
For investors who make the right guess , such calls can be highly rewarding .
For instance , investors who bought American Cyanamid Co. on the talk that it wanted to sell its pharmaceuticals business will be paid $ 101 a share under the terms of Cyanamid 's agreement to be taken over by American Home Products Corp. , a 60 % premium over the stock 's Aug. 1 price .
But it takes a cool head to buy on rumors .
Holders of McKesson Corp. endured two weeks of wild price swings before Lilly announced an agreement to buy its pharmacy benefits unit for $ 4 billion .
Their sufferings , however , are nothing compared with the ups and downs for investors in Syntex Corp. .
Eight years of takeover speculation , with accompanying price gyrations , preceded Roche Holding Ltd. 's $ 5.3 billion bid .
Even after the rumor finally became fact , a fresh rumor conspired to beat up Syntex stock .
The story began circulating this month that Roche planned to back out of the accord .
On Aug. 12 , Syntex opened at $ 22.625 , fell to $ 20.375 and closed at $ 21.75 .
By Friday , it had climbed back to $ 22.50 .
`` One needs a strong stomach and a lot of good luck to buy on rumors , '' Mr. Ackerman said .
`` The game is not as easy as it looks .
'' Sometimes the rumors are spicy versions of the truth .
The LDDS rumor centered on a story about how Electronic Data Systems Corp. planned to buy the company if LDDS completed a $ 2.5 billion takeover of Williams Cos. ' WilTel communications unit .
The terms : EDS would buy LDDS in a stock swap that gave LDDS holders EDS stock worth $ 32 a share .
The timing ?
Imminent .
Certainly no rumor so specific could be wrong , some investors cried .
Last Wednesday , when the rumor first surfaced , LDDS climbed to $ 24 , up $ 2.50 .
The real story , as best as anyone can tell , is n't anything so sensational .
Instead , based on conversations with people familiar with the two companies , it appears that an EDS official recently made an informal telephone call to an LDDS official asking to chat about possible business ventures if the WilTel deal went through .
The discussion , although later mentioned at a LDDS board meeting , did n't mention a takeover .
Of course , rumor mongering can be consciously manipulative .
In `` Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould , '' a recent movie about the late Canadian pianist\/genius , Mr. Gould is shown telling his broker to buy stock in an oil company about to strike it rich .
He asks his broker not to tell anyone .
Soon enough , even restaurant waiters are hearing that Glenn Gould is buying shares .
The stock price soars .
Mr. Gould makes a killing .
Manipulation has been successfully prosecuted , but it 's a tough case to make , Mr. Arkin said .
During the 1980s flurry of rumor mongering , Joseph Grundfest , then head of the Securities and Exchange Commission , said that trying to prove a rumor case was like `` trying to nail Jell-O to the wall .
'' PARAMETRIC TECHNOLOGY Corp. -LRB- Waltham , Mass. -RRB- -- Steven C. Walske , 42 years old , president and chief executive officer , has been named chairman , succeeding company founder Samuel Geisberg .
Mr. Geisberg , 58 , will hold the title `` senior scientist '' and work on long-range planning for the the software company .
He resigned as executive vice president and as a board member .
Parametric said Mr. Geisberg plans to devote his time to the Geisberg Foundation , which is dedicated to medical research on diabetes and arthritis .
C. Richard Harrison , 39 , senior vice president of sales and distribution , succeeds Mr. Walske as president and also gets the new title of chief operating officer .

NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group said it affirmed its ratings on about $ 2.2 billion of Revlon Consumer Products Corp. and Revlon Worldwide Corp. debt , but changed its outlook to negative from positive .
S&P rates Revlon 's unsecured debt single-B and senior secured debt single B-plus .
The companies are part of Revlon Inc. , controlled by MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. , the investment vehicle of investor Ronald Perelman .
The report said Revlon 's changed outlook `` reflects disappointing operating performance since the 1993 refinancings and substantially slower-than-anticipated improvement from their restructuring .
'' S&P cited inventory cutbacks by retailers `` and a sluggish environment for consumer products in many markets , '' which depressed 1993 sales and operating income to below 1992 levels .
It said that as of June 30 , year-to-date sales were 3.2 % above the year-earlier period , although predepreciation operating income declined from the year before .
Revlon said the rating agency 's report was erroneous because it was based on inaccurate financial data .
Revlon said that contrary to S&P 's assertion that predepreciation operating income declined , it rose 14 % in the first half from a year earlier .
And operating income increased 30 % in the first half from a year earlier , Revlon said .
Revlon also made certain forecasts to counter S&P 's evaluation .
It said the company 's third-quarter operating income will increase at least 100 % and sales will be up 10 % from a year ago .
The S&P report said Revlon remains highly leveraged , with 1993 earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation , and amortization interest coverage of 0.8 times and total debt to those measures nearly 14 times .
`` In this difficult context , Revlon must refinance about $ 80 million of debt maturing in December 1994 , as cash flow from operations will be fully absorbed by interest expense and planned capital expenditures .
'' Although the company has explored an initial public offering , `` based on recent operating results , it appears unlikely that an offering will occur in the near future , '' the agency said .
S&P said that without substantial near-term earnings improvement , `` Revlon will face continued difficulties in maintaining operating and financial levels commensurate with its rating .
'' And , it said , constrained cash flow could preclude adequate investment to preserve its competitive position .
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Trade Commission gave the green light to a merger that will create the nation 's biggest department store chain .
R.H. Macy & Co. and Federated Department Stores Inc. were cleared by federal regulators to proceed with their plan .
They signed a formal merger pact last week , but the saga dates back to January , when Federated made an unexpected pitch for Macy .
Macy is still under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , and the marriage of the companies must get the go-ahead from U.S. bankruptcy court .
State regulators are also examining the deal .
But the pact is expected to become final in December .
In a letter Friday to Sen. Howard Metzenbaum , the Ohio Democrat who heads a congressional antitrust subcommittee , an FTC official wrote that the agency staff had conducted an `` exhaustive review '' that included examining about 25 boxes of documents produced by the parties and interviewing a host of third parties that might be affected by the plan .
Among them , according to the letter , were vendors , mall developers and small retailers .
Sen. Metzenbaum had expressed concern about the anticompetitive effects of the merger , and had asked for and received a briefing earlier this month by agency staff .
Macy owns the I. Magnin and Bullock 's chains , while Federated owns Bloomingdale 's , Abraham & Straus , Jordan Marsh and several other chains .
The new retailing empire would have 460 stores nationwide and sales of about $ 13.5 billion .
Health care may be the main event and the crime bill an instructive sideshow , but other business with real costs to the economy is before Congress .
Consider the housing jambalaya .
This year 's shelter package comes in two substantial parts : the first attempts to give the sorry Department of Housing and Urban Development more leeway to improve public housing .
Basically this involves reintroduction of working people into federal projects .
Studies suggest this will lead to fewer hellholes .
No doubt even HUD has learned a few things from experience , and doubtless , too , this scheme would see some successes .
But people with 80 % of an area 's median income would qualify to have Uncle Sam as a landlord .
If poorer Americans , who now get priority for the limited billets , are still going to be put up , it stands to reason that HUD will need more money for them .
An alternative to this upgrade strategy would be more transitions to tenant management of troubled projects , but housing authorities do n't like that idea .
HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros is ambitious about change , but so far we see anecdotal evidence of trouble , such as in Buffalo where a mandate to integrate public housing has led to numerous vacancies because few want to live in `` bad '' projects .
A separate experiment , to disperse welfare families to suburbs , drew yelps recently in Essex , Md. , near Baltimore .
The crux of this problem , after all , is teenage boys in fatherless homes .
Until much is done about that problem , other reforms are window dressing .
The second leg of the shelter legislation is the sweetener , the expansion of mortgage benefits for the middle class .
Until congressional conferees pulled back last week , it looked like a dramatic move to restore `` market share '' for the Federal Housing Administration -LRB- FHA -RRB- loan guarantee program was in the works .
But taxpayers are n't safe yet .
The FHA program grew out of the Depression , and after World War II helped millions into starter homes .
But by 1992 , it figured in only 10 % of single-family house purchases .
In part that happened because prices for detached dwellings rose and the FHA limits did n't keep pace .
Homebuying grew out of reach for more Americans in the 1970s and '80s , but that was a function of interest rates and lagging real incomes among the less schooled , as well as stricter building codes and standards also forcing costs up .
The real killer for FHA , however , has been the emergence of a robust conventional-lending market with private mortgage insurance .
The quasi-governmental presence of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , resellers of home loans , has figured in that .
Indeed , intermediation of capital has n't been a problem for years .
Therefore the only reasons for wanting to restart the FHA engines are to boost artificially the demand for homes by bringing in some marginal buyers , and to raise operating revenue for Washington , which gets fees on the guarantees .
The House wanted to boost the FHA-insured loan limit to nearly $ 173,000 in expensive markets .
The conferees kept that to $ 153,000 , and the FHA ceiling in cheaper areas to about half that .
But a separate legislative move is alive to create a `` risk-share '' program with state housing agencies to allow taxpayer-backed mortgages of up to $ 203,000 in costly jurisdictions -- that is , for buyers of $ 70,000 - $ 80,000 annual income .
This would undo some earlier efforts to rein in FHA 's bad debts .
Its foreclosed properties exceed $ 2.3 billion , and nonperforming single-family loans are $ 2.4 billion .
And it does n't even seem to be aiding the needy .
Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist complains that FHA 's presence in his city 's `` target areas '' is diminishing while that of conventional lenders grows .
The worst may have been avoided in the housing legislation of 1994 but there 's still a lot of loose planks that need to be nailed down .
Two scientists at the California Institute of Technology have concluded that the earth has been cooling off for at least 6,800 years .
Their study , to appear in Science , is based on analysis of chemical ratios in the trunks of bristlecone pines in California .
But Samuel Epstein said the pine records do n't mix with current mathematical efforts to model climate .
Says Mr. Epstein : `` When the climate gets a little warmer , the models go a little haywire .
'' So it would seem .
NEW YORK -- Short sellers have been shouting for joy so far this year .
But those shouts may turn to groans soon .
Perpetually preaching gloom and doom , short sellers make money when everyone else is losing theirs .
Typically , they borrow a stock that they think is overvalued and sell it at its current price .
They 're betting that before long other investors will see what they 've seen and drive the price down .
At that point , they buy the stock in the market to replace the shares they borrowed , pocketing the difference between the price at which they sold the borrowed shares and the price at which they purchased shares to repay the loan .
By and large , short sellers have gloried in the stock market correction that began last February .
It was the first time things had gone their way in three years .
And many continue to argue that the stock market is still sickly and headed for further declines .
Certainly enthusiasm for short positions has boomed in the past several months .
The New York Stock Exchange short-interest report , which shows the level of short selling , has broken a record in every month dating back to November of last year .
On Friday , the Big Board said short interest broke another record , hitting an eye-popping 1.63 billion shares .
In fact , the short frenzy has reached a point that some stocks simply ca n't be shorted any further because no more shares are out there to be borrowed .
Popular short issues such as Snapple Beverage , PeopleSoft and Oxford Health Plans have frequently been among the `` hard-to-borrow '' issues .
Charles Biderman , who follows short activity for his investment-advisory service , Market Trim Tabs , says the hard-to-borrow list has never been higher .
He attributes the boom in short interest to heavy bets made by global hedge funds that U.S. equities would head downward this summer .
Driving this short mania are several technical indicators , such as the Arms Index , which measures the trading volume of advancing issues against the trading volume of declining issues .
The lower the ratio , the more bullish the indicator .
For example , an index of 0.50 would mean that the volume of trading in stocks that are rising in price is much higher than the volume of trading in stocks that are falling in price .
As with many measures of stock market sentiment , traders and technical analysts use such sentiment measures as contrary indicators .
If they indicate that investors are bullish , that 's taken as a bearish sign because it means that many investors are being carried away on a flood of optimism .
Conversely , bearish sentiment reflected in indicators like the Arms Index is a bullish sign -- plenty of investors are hoarding cash and sitting on the sidelines , primed to jump into stocks when prices look cheap enough .
Richard Arms , the creator of the Arms Index , says the ratio measured over the past 10 sessions stood at 0.78 Friday , a sign that many investors are delighted with the stock market 's outlook .
That 's exactly the kind of optimism that short sellers thrive on , figuring that when some upsetting event occurs , all those wildly bullish investors will bolt from the market , creating a windfall for traders with big short positions .
Donald N. Evans , president and chief trader of FX 500 , a trading-advisory firm , says he 's increasing his firm 's short positions to take advantage of any coming market decline .
`` During the past three to four years the risk factors have increased and we have started working more on the short side , '' he says .
`` Nobody really knows , but looking at our indicators , we feel that the fall is a real danger period for the bulls .
'' But some analysts suggest that the shorts may soon be coming up short .
They note that the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended at 3755.11 Friday .
That 's a 3.6 % increase during the past six weeks .
Michael Long of Rockbridge Partners in Charlotte , N.C. , says short sellers as a group were up about 21 % for the first six months of 1994 .
But the market 's gain of late has been at the shorts ' expense .
He estimates that in July short portfolios fell as much as 4 % and have dropped another few percentage points so far this month .
Short sellers can be trapped , or `` squeezed , '' if prices begin to rise instead of fall as they had predicted .
Then they 're forced to buy shares at higher prices to `` cover , '' or replace , their borrowed shares .
`` Those on the short side have had a very tough time in July and August , '' says Mr. Biderman of Market Trim Tabs .
`` A lot of the money that has come in on the short side is being covered at a loss , and a lot of funds with large short positions are not having a very good quarter .
'' One firm , Gilder , Gagnon & Howe , has had to aggressively cover some short positions in the past several weeks as positions failed to pan out , according to traders .
The firm , which manages discretionary accounts , said it is doing `` business as usual .
'' According to one longtime investor with the firm , his account is down 20 % for the year and he attributes much of the loss to losing short positions .
The firm declined to comment on the performance of individual accounts and said it would n't comment on general performance for the year because individual brokers employ their own strategies , making aggregate comparisons difficult .
Perhaps surprisingly , some genuinely bullish analysts like the idea that so many short sellers are betting against rising stock prices .
They figure that when a rally does get started -- and many expect prices to get a lift in coming weeks or months -- all those short sellers will panic and rush to cover their positions .
That will bring extra power to the rally , frightening even more shorts into buying .
The result : a startlingly strong gain in stock prices .
Stocks stabilized after tumbling on inflation fears Thursday , but investors remained cautious .
Tracking the uncertain bond market , stock prices were mostly higher , but the Dow Jones Industrial Average could n't keep pace .
It fell 0.32 , or 0.01 % , to 3,755.11 -- its third straight loss .
Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index edged up 0.51 to 463.68 , the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.26 to 742.43 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 0.32 to 255.81 .
The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index advanced 1.90 to 445.45 .
World-wide , stock prices fell in dollar terms .
The Dow Jones World Stock Index lost 0.38 to 118.66 .
On the New York Stock Exchange Friday , 1,157 issues advanced , 917 declined and 783 were unchanged .
Volume on the Big Board was 276.6 million shares .
Autodesk surged 8 1\/2 , or 17 % , to 58 1\/4 .
The company stood by an October launch date for its Release 13 AutoCAD program , amid industry rumors that the release might be delayed .
The company was also bolstered by management 's bullish earnings-growth projections .
Autodesk said it was more comfortable with the high end of its 8 % to 16 % growth projection .
SAN DIEGO , Calif. -- Steven B. Engle was named president and chief operating officer of La Jolla Pharmaceutical Co. and was elected a director , expanding the board to six members .

NEW YORK -- Though New York Times Co. may be one of the country 's most powerful communications companies , its recent moves have investors and competitors puzzled .
At a time when other newspaper companies are tying future growth to cable television , entertainment , magazines and high-tech media services , Times Co. appears to be doing just the opposite .
The company recently sold some of its largest magazines , including McCalls and Family Circle -- and it has been so slow to embrace the electronic revolution that , in media circles , it has the image of being something of a techno-Neanderthal .
Its largest recent acquisition was in 1993 , when it paid $ 1.1 billion for the parent of the Boston Globe .
While the union of two prestigious newspaper companies made Times Co. the fifth-largest newspaper publisher in the nation , it was criticized by investors and competitors who could n't see the strategic value in an alliance among two old-line companies .
`` There is a lot of wondering about what their corporate focus is at the moment , and I 'm shying away from recommending the stock now , '' says Bruce Thorp , media analyst with Provident National Bank of Philadelphia .
The stock closed Friday at $ 24.375 a share , up 25 cents , in American Stock Exchange composite trading .
While some newspaper stocks have been buoyant of late , Times Co. stock has languished near the lows it reached after the 1987 stock-market crash .
Times Co. executives concede that , as representatives of a communications company , they 've done a poor job of articulating their long-term view to Wall Street .
But Arthur Ochs Sulzberger , chairman and chief executive officer , says the company does have a plan .
It 's just that it 's being implemented slowly .
`` Obviously there is some confusion about our strategy , and I think it 's reflected in our stock price , '' Mr. Sulzberger says .
`` We 're an operating company that buys primarily newspapers and magazines .
We 're not sure which way to go on the elusive superhighway , so we 're going in a lot of directions , but in a small way .
'' One thing is clear : The company 's financial results have been helped vastly by an improved economy after six years of recessionary pounding .
For all of 1993 , Times Co. earned just $ 6.1 million , or seven cents a share .
But for this year 's second quarter , profit rose 53 % , to $ 22.4 million , and revenue rose 31 % .
Results from the purchase of the Globe 's parent , Affiliated Publications Inc. , are included , and have been a substantial help ; the Boston-area economy turned around more quickly and strongly than Times Co. 's home turf .
But questions persist .
Where are all the synergies from the Times-Globe combination ?
Having unexpectedly sold its women 's magazines , will Times Co. keep its sports and leisure magazines despite rumors that Hearst Corp. is negotiating to buy them ?
And though it has since dropped out of the running , why was Times Co. bidding for Viacom Inc. 's Madison Square Garden operation ?
Times Co. executives say the Boston newspaper is critical to its strategy of supplying international and domestic news and information -- while letting others spend huge sums on technology that may not pay off for many years , if ever .
Their view is that high-quality , hard-to-duplicate content will be valuable no matter where and how it is displayed .
But there have n't been many synergies between the two newspaper companies yet .
Although some back-office functions , such as newsprint-buying , are now joined , it will be a couple of years before the Globe begins printing the New York Times in its area .
And the Boston paper has n't even switched to the Times ' wire service from that of Washington Post Co. .
To help bolster their already solid position in editorial content and to increase readership , the company has installed a new generation of managers at its flagship New York Times newspaper .
The team includes Mr. Sulzberger 's 42-year-old son , Arthur Jr. , as publisher , who readers say is more in tune with what a younger generation of readers might want from the newspaper .
Younger readers are coveted by advertisers , but newspapers have had a tough time attracting them .
The paper also hopes to attract young readers by providing more color pages , late-breaking stories and late sports results .
This will be possible by 1997 when a state-of-the-art printing plant is set to open .
Although some analysts worry that the plant 's cost is too high , Times Co. executives say the plant will be well worth its $ 315 million price .
But all this has n't come cheaply .
Like other major newspapers , the New York Times has increasingly looked to cover rising costs by raising home-delivery and newsstand prices rather than through the traditional practice of raising ad rates .
But circulation has suffered .
After a string of price increases last year , audited Times circulation for the six months ended March 31 fell 3.4 % , to 1.2 million , for its weekday edition , and dropped 2.5 % , to 1.8 million , for its Sunday edition .
A Times spokeswoman blamed the declines on the price increases , an extremely harsh winter and `` a slow news period .
'' Meanwhile , as far Times Co. 's other publications go , Lance Primis , president and chief operating officer , says the plan is to keep those `` to which we can add editorial value .
'' That includes its 10 sports magazines , among them Golf Digest and Tennis .
`` There is absolutely no truth to the rumors of a sale , '' Mr. Primis says .
Indeed , the company says it will continue to look for acquisitions .
Mr. Sulzberger confirms that Times Co. was interested briefly in Madison Square Garden , but says it wanted just the cable sports channel , MSG Network , which has cable rights to broadcast the Knickerbockers basketball and Rangers hockey games .
He said Times Co. jumped out when `` it was clear Viacom did n't want to break up the pieces .
'' As the MSG flirtation shows , cable TV is one of Times Co. 's targets .
`` It 's very much a part of our strategy to develop a video component to our portfolio , '' says Gordon Medenica , vice president of operations and planning .
Up to now , the company has barely been a player in the video field , aside from the five TV stations it owns .
And the company still has a long way to go in new media .
In July , the New York Times newspaper introduced a computer service on America Online , but it has n't made much of a splash .
A critic from New York magazine ridiculed it for being `` as interactive as a tree stump , '' complaining that reporters and editors do n't interact with subscribers nearly as much as on other services .
Some Times insiders on the multimedia side have complained to counterparts at rival publishers of feeling handicapped by a tradition of noncooperation between news and business sides -- and by an accord with Mead Corp. 's Nexis service .
Nexis has exclusive on-line rights to the Times ' full text after 24 hours from publication .
-LRB- There are conditions , however , that allow the Times to continue to use its content on various electronic services .
-RRB- Mr. Primis counters the criticism : `` We 've made a ton of dough from that contract on the way to the information superhighway .
'' He also stresses that more electronic projects are contemplated .
NEW YORK -- Short interest continued its record-breaking climb on the New York Stock Exchange , rising 1.3 % to 1,625,185,971 shares in mid-August from 1,604,748,885 shares in mid-July .
Short interest on the American Stock Exchange rose 0.05 % to 107,276,041 shares from an adjusted 107,219,157 shares in mid-July .
RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. 's short-interest level topped the Big Board list , rising 1.1 million shares , to 46.8 million .
Analysts said that much of the heavy short-interest position stems from an arbitrage play that involves the company 's preferred stock .
Short interest for Ford Motor Co. surged nearly two million shares , to 37.6 million , and Chrysler Corp. 's position increased 31,734 shares , to 26.1 million .
Analysts said that short sellers may be anticipating a slowdown in the U.S. economy that would hurt car sales .
AT&T Corp. 's short interest soared about two million shares since mid-July , to 27.5 million .
Much of the short interest in AT&T involves arbitrage opportunities surrounding its pending acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications Corp. , analysts said .
Kmart Corp. had one of the largest increases in short interest .
The retailer had 8.4 million shares of short interest in mid-August compared with 4.7 million last month .
Analysts said the retailer 's debate over how to build shareholder value has increased bearish sentiment in the stock .
Recently , Kmart proposed an initial public offering plan for three of its specialty retail units .
Traders who sell securities `` short '' borrow stock and sell it , betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender .
Short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders .
The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short-interest ratio rose to 6.3 from 6.19 .
The ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange 's average daily trading volume that would be required to convert the total short-interest position .
Average daily Big Board volume was 257.8 million shares , compared with 259.1 million shares last month .
Big Board and Amex short-interest positions were calculated for the month including the 21 trading days through Aug. 8 , with Aug. 15 as the settlement date .
The following tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest position of at least 250,000 shares existed at mid-August or in which the short position had changed by at least 50,000 shares since mid-July .
TUBBY 'S Inc. -LRB- Sterling Heights , Mich. -RRB- -- Robert M. Paganes was named chief executive officer of this fast-food chain , succeeding Alexander P. Bardy who left the company last week in a corporate restructuring .
Mr. Paganes , 38 years old , suceeded Mr. Bardy , 64 , in June as president of the company when Mr. Bardy was named chairman .
Peter T. Paganes , the CEO 's 52-year-old brother , becomes chairman of the board in addition to his duties as vice president and treasurer .
Corporate attorney Vincent J. Tatone , 37 , was named secretary of the company .
Here is one gift horse President Clinton has to look in the mouth : a 3 1\/2-foot-tall , woven wicker and reed horse given by Peter Kravchenko , the Belarussian minister of foreign affairs .
Mr. Clinton , like other federal employees , ca n't accept gifts for personal use , though he can take them on behalf of the government .
He and Mrs. Clinton usually put their gifts in an archive .
It 's quite a trove : The first family received an estimated $ 120,000 of mementos from foreigners in 1993 alone , according to an annual report by the State Department 's Office of Protocol .
Susana Higuchi Fujimori , the Peruvian president 's wife , gave Hillary Rodham Clinton a silver bonbon dish valued at $ 600 .
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney presented Mr. Clinton with a bronze statue of a bearded man playing the saxophone , with an estimated value of $ 900 .
But Prince Abdulaziz bin Fahd AlSaud of Saudia Arabia bestowed the biggest gift : a leather suitcase bearing 22-karat gold jewelry , a gold coffee service and a sterling-silver letter opener , valued at $ 32,000 in all .
Later this year , the government will auction off some 1,700 gifts for which no official use has been found .
They include two silk robes in colors of pink , gray , blue and green given to Secretary of State Warren Christopher by Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai ; a ladies ' Omega watch in a gold-colored casing that was presented to former Secretary of Defense Les Aspin by King Hussein I and Queen Noor Al Hussein of Jordan ; and four leather-bound volumes of `` The New Encyclopedias of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land '' given to National Security Adviser Anthony Lake by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin .
But do n't count on bidding for the contents of the three mahogany humidors that Philippine President Fidel Ramos gave Mr. Clinton last year .
Mr. Clinton had the cigars destroyed .
BEIJING -LRB- AP -RRB- -- China said it was opposed to a U.S. plan to use the World Bank and other multilateral lending agencies to push for labor rights in borrowing countries .
President Clinton is expected to sign a bill that would require U.S. representatives to the lending institutions to push for internationally recognized human rights , including the right to form labor unions for bargaining , a ban on forced labor and limits on child labor .
`` We are very concerned about this and firmly oppose introducing human-rights labor criteria and other noneconomic factors into the activities of the World Bank and other international development agencies , '' said a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry .
He did not give his name , in keeping with ministry practice .
China is the single largest beneficiary of World Bank loans ; the bank 's loans to Beijing total $ 18.6 billion .
The spokesman said the World Bank 's charter `` has laid down in explicit terms that its business activities should not interfere in the politics of any member state .
'' He said existing international conventions should be enough to ensure that human rights are protected .
The U.S. is the biggest stockholder in the World Bank , but it does not have veto power over loans .
However , decisions by lenders such as the World Bank are usually made by consensus , and the U.S. for years prevented loans from going to Vietnam .
LONDON -- Eurotunnel , the Anglo-French Channel tunnel operator , dismissed a news report that there would be imminent fare reductions in its passenger and freight services .
The Observer , a London paper , reported yesterday that Eurotunnel would begin making changes `` in the next few weeks '' because a fare war launched by ferry operators has left it `` an estimated 20 % overpriced .
'' But a company spokesman called the report `` speculative '' and said , `` We are not in the process of reviewing prices .
'' He said Eurotunnel would make a decision about next year 's prices `` toward the end of the year .
'' The oft-delayed Channel tunnel , which is vastly over budget , recently completed its second financial infusion in four years .
Analysts believe a cut in fares , prompted by ferry rivals , could cause Eurotunnel to fall short of revenue targets and introduce further financial upheaval .
Eurotunnel on Friday said it had sales in the second quarter of 19.4 million French francs -LRB- $ 3.7 million -RRB- .
The company said the figures refer to freight revenue and some ancilliary activities since Eurotunnel began partial operations May 16 .
NEWARK , N.J. -- A Shell Oil station in New Jersey will soon also have a natural-gas fueling station .
Seeking to encourage the use of natural-gas vehicles , Public Service Electric & Gas Co. and Shell Oil Co. , a unit of Royal Dutch\/Shell Group , signed an agreement to open the first such public facility in the state .
`` Assurance of an infrastructure is necessary for fleet operators and others who are interested in converting to natural gas vehicles , '' said a spokesman for PSE&G .
The facility for the clean-burning fuel will be installed at a Shell station in Jersey City by the end of this year .
In June , state regulators approved PSE&G proposals to encourage use of natural-gas vehicles , including a vehicle-rate schedule , a $ 1,000 rebate to purchasers of natural-gas vehicles , and a plan to establish fueling stations .
The utility is a unit of Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. .
A PSE&G spokeswoman said she did n't know of any privately owned natural-gas vehicles in the state , but more than 350 such vehicles are owned and operated by companies and other organizations , including Bell Atlantic Corp. and the state of New Jersey .
STOCKHOLM -- Swedish automotive and aerospace group Saab-Scania AB , a wholly owned , nontraded subsidiary of AB Investor , said it swung to pretax profit of 1.2 billion kronor -LRB- $ 154.6 million -RRB- in the first six months from a loss of 264 million kronor a year earlier .
Meanwhile , Saab Automobile , the Sweden-based auto maker owned jointly by Saab-Scania and General Motors Corp. of Detroit , posted pretax profit of 140 million kronor for the first half on recovering auto sales , compared with a 684 million kronor loss a year earlier .
At Saab-Scania , order intake increased 40 % in the first six months to 16.04 billion kronor from 11.43 billion kronor , the group said .
Operating profit surged to 1.43 billion kronor from 39 million kronor , Saab-Scania said .
The return to profit is attributable to the group 's Scania bus and truck operations , it said .
Scania reported a first-half pretax profit of 1.65 billion kronor , compared with pretax profit of 173 million kronor a year earlier .
Higher sales volumes , better capacity utilization , a more profitable product mix , increased sales of spare parts and favorable currency-exchange rates are behind the improvement , the group said .
Scania 's six-month order intake rose about 50 % to 18,600 vehicles from 12,300 vehicles and first-half sales volumes advanced 26 % to 15,500 vehicles from 12,400 vehicles , the group said .
The group 's Saab Aircraft & Defense activities remained unprofitable with an operating loss of 200 million kronor , widening from a loss of 156 million kronor , it said .
Sales dropped to 2.1 billion kronor from 2.6 billion kronor , it said .
The lower sales and worse operating result are mainly attributable to reduced sales of civilian aircraft , it said .
The first-half profit for Saab Automobile follows a strong recovery by the group in the second quarter , when it reported pretax profit of 203 million kronor , the first profit reported by the venture since it was formed at the start of 1990 .
Novell Inc. said that it expects to post fiscal third-quarter earnings below analysts ' expectations by as much as 20 % because its recent acquisitions have proved more expensive than anticipated .
The software concern , which recently paid $ 1 billion in shares and options for WordPerfect Corp. and the Quattro Pro spreadsheet business of Borland International Inc. , said that revenue from the two purchases turned out to be lower than expected , while operating expenses were greater .
Novell said it would take a charge of $ 120 million for the quarter , which ended July 30 , largely for research and development on the spreadsheet business .
The Provo , Utah , company said that its earnings fell short of analysts ' mean forecast of 25 cents a share by 15 % to 20 % , indicating net income of about 20 cents a share .
A year ago , Novell reported a loss of $ 255.4 million , or 80 cents a share , on revenue of $ 273 million .
The loss included a charge of $ 320 million , or $ 1 a share , related to another acquisition .
Novell , the industry powerhouse in making software that links together networks of computers , has grown lately through a string of expensive purchases .
But analysts have fretted that the company is overreaching , trying to reposition itself as a direct challenger to the huge Microsoft Corp. , which dominates the personal-computer software business , but without any central vision of what exactly Novell will become .
The company 's stock has reflected this concern , trading as high as $ 35.25 in the past two years , but steadily sliding .
The company made the announcement after the close of trading Friday .
Novell , trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market , closed at $ 15.125 , up 12.5 cents .
Meanwhile , Novell has stumbled in its core market with lackluster sales of the latest version of its mainstay NetWare product .
These events reached a crescendo this month when Ray Noorda , the 70-year-old networking guru who led the company to its zenith and then embarked upon his acquisitive spree , turned over the chairmanship to Robert J. Frankenberg , who succeeded Mr. Noorda as chief executive officer earlier this year .
Mr. Frankenberg , 47 , is expected to slash costs and personnel as he tries to mold a coherent company out of the various components he inherited .
While it comes too late to benefit its third quarter , the company said Friday that a new cost-cutting program is already under way .
It did n't give any details .
CLEVELAND -- M.A. Hanna Co. , citing costs related to the recent sale of its roofing elastical membrane unit , will take a charge of $ 1.1 million , or four cents a share , in the third quarter .
In the year-earlier period , the specialty chemicals maker had net income of $ 8.86 million , or 43 cents a share .
Hanna sold the unit to Firestone Building Products , a division of Bridgestone\/Firestone Inc. .
Mexican ruling-party candidate Ernesto Zedillo won a surprisingly easy victory in yesterday 's presidential election , exit polls indicated , and the voting appeared free of violence .
Although the election had been the most hotly contested in Mexico 's history , the ruling party 's formidable machine had appeared to let Dr. Zedillo pull away from his opponents over the past few weeks .
And the exit polls showed him winning with about 50 % of the vote .
The runner-up was Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , the center-right candidate , with more than 25 % .
In third place was Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , the leftist candidate , with 18 % , according to polls overseen by Mitofsky International , a U.S. organization that has been doing exit polls there for decades .
Although Dr. Zedillo stopped short of claiming victory , he met with a handful of foreign correspondents moments after the polls closed in Mexico City yesterday evening and said : `` Let 's put it this way : I 'm very happy -- happier than I expected to be .
'' Dr. Zedillo said he thought the ruling party , the PRI , would even retain control of Congress -- something that has been in doubt .
He reiterated that he might include members of the opposition in his cabinet but again said he would do so based only on their qualifications , not because he was a weak president trying to build a coalition government .
Neither of the other major candidates had said anything publicly about the results as of yesterday evening .
It will be days before the final results are announced in Mexico , and the exit polls are sure to be challenged .
Because of complaints by civic groups and opposition parties , it was n't until yesterday afternoon that the government finally ruled that Mitofsky could even release its polls .
Opposition groups noted that polls in Mexico have historically been unreliable , because people were afraid to oppose the authoritarian ruling party .
The groups say that , as a result , even exit polls will be skewed in favor of the PRI .
There have also been charges of fraud , and one of the opposition parties may well challenge the results of the election .
As of late yesterday , the leftist party , the PRD , had issued statements saying the PRI had been up to its old , fraudulent tricks .
With Dr. Zedillo apparently obtaining such a clear margin of victory , it appears that the opposition will have a hard time convincing people that enough fraud occurred that it swayed the results of the national elections .
So the uneasy calm that pervaded Mexico yesterday likely will continue .
Dr. Zedillo said in the interview yesterday that `` the biggest test passed today , with a very calm day .
So in the days to come I do n't think we 'll have any problems .
'' That would be good news not only for Mexicans , who have been shaken throughout this year by a series of extraordinary events -- the Indian uprising in January , the assassination of the first man chosen as the ruling party 's presidential candidate and the kidnappings of two of Mexico 's richest men .
Calm would also reassure Mexico 's newly crucial trading partner , the U.S. , and all the foreign investors who have provided so much of the money that has been used to restructure the Mexican economy .
Foreign interests expecting a solid Zedillo win have pushed the stock market up some 35 % in recent weeks and would obviously welcome confirmation of that victory , because he is seen as the candidate most likely to continue Mexico 's economic opening .
Limiting the opposition 's ability to claim fraud will be the fact that this is the most-watched vote in Mexican history .
The Civic Alliance , the biggest of the watchdogs , and other groups have assembled an estimated 80,000-plus observers to watch the 96,000 voting places and are using sophisticated computer analyses to target their efforts at places where fraud seemed to occur in the past .
There are also close to 1,000 foreign observers who have no formal standing with the government -- one election official called them `` electoral tourists '' -- but who may reassure Mexicans who have come to distrust most anything officials here say .
In addition , voting yesterday appeared to be heavy , a sign that Mexicans finally believe their votes count for something .
Lines more than an hour long snaked away from many of the schools , vacant lots and so forth where voting booths were set up .
Election officials speculated that turnout might be 60 % to 70 % , compared with just 48 % in the previous presidential elections , six years ago .
Still , people here are still a bit nervous about what may happen , largely because Mr. Cardenas , the leftist candidate , has summoned his followers into city centers around the country at midday today .
The event , a sort of high noon for Mexico , is the event most likely to lead to demonstrations about the elections .
Mr. Cardenas had said the gathering of what will probably be hundreds of thousands of people will be to celebrate his victory and the rebirth of Mexican democracy .
But the candidate now has to deal with the exit polls showing he finished a distant third .
He also is dealing with the legacy of the 1988 elections , which many Mexicans say they believe he would have won if not for massive fraud .
So the fear is that he may incite the crowds into civil disobedience that could lead to violence .
One political cartoonist neatly summarized how much Mr. Cardenas 's draw of support today now matters more than what he does in the actual elections .
In the drawing , Dr. Zedillo and his main challenger , Mr. Fernandez , are shown lost in thought , with calendars marked Aug. 21 in the circles above their heads .
Mr. Cardenas 's thought calendar is marked Aug. 22 .
In the days leading up to the elections , some groups were already preparing for civil disobedience .
In Mexico City on Thursday night , social activists gathered to explain to followers how to conduct nonviolent civil disobedience .
Three large groups in the city met to discuss taking over government buildings and highways -- although it was unclear how organized the groups really were .
The biggest issue shaping up here concerned special voting booths , designed for people who were n't going to be near their home districts yesterday .
Many of the booths ran out of ballots by early afternoon , because they were limited to 300 ballots each , and frustrated voters who had waited in line for hours .
Yesterday evening , 700 people gathered in the town of Chalco near Mexico City , screaming , `` Robbers !
Robbers !
'' Dozens claimed they were denied their vote because they were known to favor opposition candidates .
In Tecpan , a small town on the western coast , human-rights worker Hilda Navarette found the use of all the ballots suspicious .
`` It is impossible that so many out-of-towners would be passing through Tecpan , '' she says .
The leftist PRD seized on the problem to contend that there was widespread fraud .
It said that the ruling party had managed to cut lots of opposition supporters off the electoral rolls at their designated voting places , so those voters had to go to the special voting booths -- only to find that ballots had run out .
Still , even many social activists were saying the problem did n't seem to be malicious .
The limit on the number of ballots stemmed from an agreement by all the parties and was in fact proposed by the PRD .
The PRD sought the limit because such special voting places had been used to commit so much fraud in the past .
The ruling party left itself open to plenty of less-specific complaints because , while possibly staying within the letter of the law , it was still apparently using its control of the government as leverage to win votes .
For instance , one watchdog group , Global Exchange , reported that the government was handing out benefits checks to farmers near Acapulco on Thursday at what almost looked like a campaign rally for the ruling party , even though the government had agreed not to make any payments for a week before the election .
Another watchdog , Grassroots International , said farm villagers in the southern state of Oaxaca had refused to promise their votes to the ruling party and had been denied the benefits checks , so they had occupied a highway to protest .
Jose Luis Madrid , a street vendor , says he was threatened with the loss of his license if he did n't attend a rally for the ruling party .
And the Civic Alliance says it has documented more than 200 such threats .
The Mexican Human Rights Academy says the ruling party , the PRI , has almost certainly spent more than the $ 40 million allowed by law .
The academy says the PRI apparently spent a third of that limit just since April on ads with merely two big television stations -- not counting the ads on 70 other television stations , the advertising blitz through every other Mexican medium and all the free food and trinkets handed out at PRI rallies .
And Mexicans , having lived through decades of fraud , assume that more problems will surface in coming days .
The Mexican language is full of colorful expressions about electoral fraud .
`` Pregnant ballot boxes , '' for instance , are those that arrive at a voting booth already stuffed with ballots .
A `` mad mouse '' is someone whose name has been illicitly scratched off the list of voters at his neighborhood ballot box and who is sent to another , only to be told that he belongs elsewhere .
The drill goes on and on , so that the poor voter spends his whole day running around .
Dr. Zedillo said in the interview that , after waiting for official election results , he will spend the next days and weeks trying to overcome any lingering problems and pull the country together behind his economic and social programs .
He says he 'll be talking to the other political parties and lots of other types of groups because `` I have a responsibility not only to the people who voted for the PRI but to all Mexicans .
'' When he talks to people , he will find that even those who voted for him are n't satisifed that Mexico has changed enough and that many will push him for deeper moves toward democracy .
`` People are not going to continue suffering the way they have been suffering , '' says Cristina Rodriguez , sitting in her beachfront crafts shop in Zihuatanejo in the western state of Guerrero .
`` They lack work .
Salaries are low .
'' Mrs. Rodriguez , whose husband has been assaulted and robbed three times in the past year , adds that `` there is a lot of insecurity .
'' She says she has little faith in Mr. Cardenas 's opposition party , the PRD , but said she was voting for him anyway just to support the need for change .
SANTA CRUZ , Calif. -- The information highway has reached another frontier -- fast food .
Customers in this seaside city will be able to order pizza using the Internet , under a joint venture between the Pizza Hut unit of Purchase , N.Y.-based PepsiCo Inc. and Santa Cruz Operation Inc. , which supplies an operating system and communications software that will be used by the food chain .
The pilot program is open only to computer users with a complete Internet connection and Mosaic , a program that makes it easier to navigate through the maze of interconnected networks .
The software allows customers to call up a computerized menu and order form , which allows them to make choices with a click of a mouse pointing device .
PizzaNet , as the pilot program is called , will route orders through a Pizza Hut computer in Wichita , Kan. , and relay them to the nearest Pizza Hut .
The pizza is then delivered to the customers .
The system is n't necessarily faster than a phone call , the companies acknowledge .
Pizza Hut , with 8,500 U.S. restaurants and delivery centers , intends to study the Santa Cruz test before rolling the system out to other cities .
But Doug Michels , executive vice president of Santa Cruz Operation , says the pilot program is an important symbol of new types of businesses evolving because of the Internet and Mosaic .
STURBRIDGE , Mass. -- Unswayed by a last-minute advertising blitz by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , local residents at a town meeting here took a nonbinding vote against a proposed Wal-Mart supercenter to be built on the edge of town .
Although the vote wo n't prevent construction , opponents said the vote -- which a town official , Michael Miller , said was about 600-to-100 against the store -- should send a signal to the country 's largest retailer .
`` The people said , ` We do n't want it , ' '' said Carol Goodwin , organizer of a group opposed to the store , which would be in a shopping mall near a highway , Route 20 .
Mr. Miller said Wal-Mart representatives did n't attend the meeting , but had asked him to read a letter stating the company 's position .
He declined .
In the letter , as in full-page ads the company and its local developer had run in local newspapers , Wal-Mart promised to be a good neighbor and touted the benefits of creating jobs and increasing the local tax base .
Wal-Mart , which has run into stiff opposition in many New England towns , did n't return calls seeking comment on the vote .
Opponents do n't object to the construction of the mall -- just to Wal-Mart , which Ms. Goodwin said `` is just way too big , '' and would cause traffic woes and hurt local merchants .
She said the town has nothing against Wal-Mart .
`` We 'd be opposed to anything this size , '' she said .
VISNE NEMECKE , Slovakia -- It 's midnight at the Slovak-Ukrainian border .
Polish private detective Krzysztof Rutkowski barks at a man almost twice his size , the driver of a silver Audi sedan : `` Where 's the original ignition key ?
Where 's the original locking gas cap ?
'' A hundred cars snake back from this checkpoint , waiting for hours in a cloud of leaden exhaust to clear customs .
Most are Ladas , Volgas and Skodas -- the aging dregs of East Bloc production .
But Mr. Rutkowski cares only about the rare standouts : the expensive cars from farther West , like this suspicious Audi .
New locks can mean a hot car .
And that 's just what he 's after .
Krzysztof -LRB- pronounced KSHISH-tof -RRB- Rutkowski is a modern bounty hunter chasing rustlers in Europe 's wild , wild East .
Armed with a laptop computer , cellular phone , and occasionally a Glosk-19 pistol , the private eye from Poland hunts down expensive cars stolen from Western and Central Europe .
His clients include dozens of major insurance companies , car rental agencies and distraught private owners .
His quarry : the gangs and couriers who last year stole more than 300,000 cars from those regions .
`` He is effective , '' says Helmut Schwarz , who works with an Austrian insurer that retains the services of Mr. Rutkowski and other car chasers .
Indeed , it turns out that the Silver Audi has been reported stolen .
Mr. Rutkowski estimates that he and his staff of 15 snag 300 cars a year .
For each he gets paid as much as 10 % of the car 's value , which he says can reach $ 4,000 .
`` I can not complain about my financial situation , '' he offers coyly .
But his methods have raised a few eyebrows .
`` One afternoon three years ago , we burst into a bank in Gdansk -- four guys with guns drawn , '' Mr. Rutkowski recalls .
`` Everyone hit the floor .
The guards were so scared they ran upstairs .
They thought we were there to rob the place .
'' Instead , Mr. Rutkowski 's team was grabbing a notorious car thief .
Incidents such as that , plus shootouts and car chases with his souped-up Chrysler Shelby Charger -- even blasting across the Ukrainian border with bullet-proof vests and shotguns -- have made Mr. Rutkowski a minor celebrity , and a headache to the Polish police .
A policeman himself for six years that included Poland 's period of martial law , the wiry detective left the force in 1986 .
Now 34 years old , he says he quit out of dissatisfaction with being `` the executive arm of the Communist government .
'' The police suggest he was dismissed .
One published report claims he was fired for `` dangerous excess of initiative .
'' Mr. Rutkowski revels in the notoriety .
`` Often people say that our methods verge on illegal , '' he says .
But `` we ` re simply better in this field '' than the police .
After his exploits at the Gdansk bank and other incidents two years ago , Poland 's central command revoked his gun permit and told local police not to cooperate with him .
`` But when the noise stopped , he stirred it up himself , '' says Bogna Swiatkowska , a reporter for the daily Zycie Warszawy , who has covered Mr. Rutkowski for years .
`` It was a real war , '' she says of the battle he waged in Polish media against the police .
It got him noticed .
Others question Mr. Rutkowski 's friends more than his methods .
`` He works well because he has connections among police and among thieves , '' contends Piotr Najsztub , a reporter for the daily Gazeta Wyborcza who covers police issues .
Mr. Najsztub says trading in stolen cars forms `` a significant part of overall police corruption in Poland .
'' Mr. Rutkowski maintains that his hands are clean , and bemoans both cops and robbers .
`` Thieves these days , they 're so blatant , '' he says with a mix of amazement and admiration .
One Mercedes 500SL , valued at $ 100,000 , proved to be such a lure that thieves stole it twice -- the second time right out of the guarded Warsaw impoundment lot where he , the police and the prosecutor 's office keep their catch until the cars are reclaimed .
`` In broad daylight , '' the detective says .
The plot was foiled , says Mr. Rutkowski , when the driver crashed .
These days the bounty hunter relies less on shootouts and chases than on information and technology .
He has a network of informants and gumshoes from Poland to Italy .
He says this gives him a leg up on a growing list of ex-cops and other would-be competition .
The Slovak-Ukrainian border inspection shows how he puts his new tools to work .
Having befriended Slovakia 's central police command 18 months ago , Mr. Rutkowski rolls up at the checkpoint , presents a letter of introduction and gets to work .
With a uniformed customs officer , he checks the license and registration of each recent-model Western car .
Then he checks the vehicle 's serial number against those of 300,000 stolen cars in his laptop 's database .
If they match , authorities impound the car .
In half a day , he bags three German-made cars .
If a car is n't on the database , he looks for other signs , such as the Audi 's new locks .
If he can convince the police , they hold the car until further checks can be made .
That 's what has happened to the silver Audi .
With the Audi 's registration papers in hand , Mr. Rutkowski marches off to the Slovak customs office .
After shouting into the prehistoric telephone for an hour , word arrives from German authorities .
`` Bingo , '' says Mr. Rutkowski .
`` The car and the driver are wanted .
'' CITFED BANCORP Inc. -LRB- Dayton , Ohio -RRB- -- Gilbert P. Williamson , 57 years old , retired chairman and chief executive officer of NCR Corp. , was elected a new director of this savings-bank holding company and of its Citizens Federal Bank unit .
His appointment increases the board size to 10 members .
Ronald O. Perelman is in an awkward spot .
The head of cosmetics titan Revlon Inc. has pulled all Revlon ads from Hearst Corp. magazines in the U.S. and United Kingdom and from its television stations .
At the same time , his own empire is expanding to include media companies .
Revlon 's official reason for the Hearst pullout , which affects such magazines as Cosmopolitan , Harper 's Bazaar and Redbook : It is miffed at a new Hearst policy that no longer guarantees Revlon prime ad positions in Hearst magazines .
But according to Hearst , Mr. Perelman pulled the advertising because he was angered by a profile in the September issue of Hearst 's Esquire magazine of Patricia Duff , his girlfriend .
Revlon was to spend $ 5 million on advertising in Hearst magazines this year , making it one of Hearst 's largest cosmetics advertisers .
Indeed , such magazines as Cosmopolitan and Harper 's Bazaar depend heavily on revenue from beauty ads .
The advertising pullout `` absolutely sends a chilling message to other publishers , '' says Martin S. Walker , chairman of Walker Communications , an industry consultant .
Although many advertisers have pulled ads from publications that have run unfavorable articles about them , the dispute between Mr. Perelman and Hearst has rattled media executives because Revlon is a world-wide advertiser and because it pulled ads from such a broad range of Hearst properties .
And regardless of his motivation , Mr. Perelman 's dramatic action presents a dilemma for the budding media kingpin .
Industry executives note that Mr. Perelman , who now owns television stations with news departments , could some day get a taste of his own medicine from an angry advertiser .
Should that happen , `` we are big boys and know how to deal with our partners , '' says James Conroy , Revlon senior vice president and special counsel .
`` But we believe we would not make such a bad business decision as Hearst made in this instance .
'' As head of Revlon , Mr. Perelman carries considerable clout in media circles .
In 1993 , Revlon spent $ 20 million in U.S. magazines such as Cosmopolitan and Conde Nast 's Vogue , and close to $ 50 million in total on advertising in magazines , cable and network television and outdoor billboards , according to Competitive Media Reporting , a market research company .
But as chairman of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. , Mr. Perelman also controls New World Communications Group Inc. , a diverse television operation .
Mr. Perelman stunned the media business in May when New World said it would switch the affiliations of 12 television stations it owns or plans to acquire to Fox Broadcasting Co. , from ABC , CBS and NBC .
He also owns Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. , the comic book and licensing company that owns rights to such characters as Spiderman .
New World also recently bought an interest in an infomercial company .
Yet what has captured the attention of the media business lately has been Mr. Perelman 's high-profile relationship with Ms. Duff .
Gossip columnists began to note their relationship soon after his recent divorce from TV reporter Claudia Cohen , and Ms. Duff 's separation from Hollywood film executive Mike Medavoy .
A Revlon spokesman confirms that Ms. Duff is Mr. Perelman 's companion and is expecting his child in January .
The Esquire article , which reached newsstands last week , describes Ms. Duff as stunning and well-connected .
But it also linked the end of her recent marriage to the souring professional fortunes of her former husband and quoted unnamed sources hissing that she had simply traded one wealthy husband for an even wealthier man .
Revlon executives insist that the Esquire article had nothing to do with its decision to stop advertising in Hearst properties .
Mr. Conroy said Revlon 's action was based on Hearst 's refusal to guarantee Revlon 's ads prominent positions in its magazines .
Revlon executives say they have been at loggerheads with Hearst for some time over changes in a decades-old pecking order that awards the best ad positions to Revlon , Estee Lauder , and Cosmair , usually in that order .
Publishing executives close to the cosmetics companies say Hearst had begun giving choice spots once reserved for Revlon ads to newer advertisers that were spending more .
Revlon 's spending in Hearst U.S. magazines had been declining before this year , from $ 10 million in 1989 to less than $ 1 million last year .
`` Position is the single most important issue in print advertising and it is taken seriously by all advertisers , '' Mr. Conroy says .
`` We were at odds with Hearst about it long before this article came along .
'' Hearst officials wo n't comment on any changes in the positioning of ads in its magazines .
But they point out that Mr. Perelman 's ire has reached far beyond its U.S.-based magazines .
Revlon has also pulled advertising from magazines published by Hearst in the U.K. and has pulled broadcast advertising from Hearst Broadcasting division , which operates six TV stations in cities such as Boston and Milwaukee .
A Hearst spokeswoman says Revlon pulled its ads `` because of the article that appeared in the September Esquire ... We fully back our editor Ed Kosner and stand by the article as fair and accurate reporting .
'' Mr. Kosner was hired last year from New York magazine to breathe new life into Esquire .
Even though Ms. Duff had cooperated with Esquire on the profile -- sitting through a three-and-a-half hour lunch with the author and spending hours with magazine fact checkers going over the details of the story -- Hearst insiders say Mr. Perelman personally called a high-ranking Hearst executive to ask that the magazine not publish the article on Ms. Duff .
Hearst insiders also say Mr. Perelman threatened legal action to prevent the article from reaching newsstands .
Revlon 's Mr. Conroy says neither Mr. Perelman nor anyone at Revlon threatened legal action .
As for why Revlon would penalize Hearst properties world-wide for a change in policy at its U.S. magazines , Revlon 's Mr. Conroy says `` we felt we could n't do business with the corporation '' following the changes in the policy .
`` We felt they might do a similar thing in other advertising ventures , '' he added .
Retailers shopping for top executives are finding a scarcity .
The industry is `` fundamentally talent-poor , '' says recruiter Kathy Turner of Los Angeles search firm Helstrom Turner & Associates .
She notes that `` a lot of work '' is needed to groom more retailing leaders .
Part of the problem is that sweeping changes in the retail industry , which has tended to promote from within , are forcing its top executives to have more diverse qualities .
Today 's chiefs must grapple with such innovations as computerized buying and competition from newer formats such as home shopping and superstores .
They have to be able to navigate international expansion .
And reading a computer spreadsheet is as important as finding the next hot hemline .
Alan Raxter , chief financial officer of Younkers Inc. , says that the Midwest department-store chain expects its up-and-coming executives to have a `` much better overall knowledge of the business '' than it used to .
Just two years ago , candidates for general-merchandise manager positions talked to just the top one or two merchandising executives and the head of human relations .
But this past Friday , one candidate spent a day in separate meetings with the controller , the head of information services , the chief executive officer and , finally , with Mr. Raxter himself .
`` The profile of a retail executive is changing , '' says A. David Brown , an executive recruiter with Korn\/Ferry International .
`` The sophistication and demands of the business are quite different now .
'' He says clients specifically request a `` more comprehensive business person '' -- which is to say someone with both creative and financial savvy .
Because so many executives are out of work following a slew of retail mergers in recent years , it would seem that retailers would be able to pick and choose .
But companies often demand marquee names .
`` It 's such hype ; people get so built up , '' says Phyllis Tama , of executive recruiting firm Tama , Lucas Ltd. , New York .
Adds Steven Claytor , of MAS Marketing Inc. , Chicago : `` There are probably very terrific unsung heroes out there .
'' Judging from the way retailers talk , though , `` it would seem there are 4 1\/2 people in the world '' who could fit the bill , says New York consultant Wendy Liebmann .
Timothy Boerkel , an executive recruiter for Russell Reynolds Associates Inc. in New York , reels off some estimable names in the industry : Gap Inc. 's president , Millard Drexler ; Limited Inc. 's chairman , Leslie Wexner ; and David Dworkin , chief executive of Broadway Stores Inc. `` The list starts getting short really quick , '' Mr. Boerkel says .
Headhunters and retail consultants figure the current shortage will continue for several years .
That means directors of struggling retailers -- and there are plenty now , as competition intensifies and consumers watch their pennies -- often stick with their chief executives longer than they otherwise might .
`` No one wants to fire the general if there 's not a white knight waiting in the wings , '' says New York retail consultant Kurt Barnard .
Recent legal battles over a few executives deemed attractive show how tight the market is .
In 1990 , Neiman Marcus Group Inc. sued Federated Department Stores Inc. when its chief executive , Allen Questrom , left to head up Federated ; Federated settled .
Later , when Mr. Questrom 's star hire at Federated , merchandising chief Roger Farah , jumped to R.H. Macy & Co. , Federated sued Macy ; the two retailers settled .
To fill Mr. Farah 's post , Mr. Questrom hired Terry Lundgren , his successor at Neiman .
Neiman , which has n't sued so far , last month named an internal executive to fill the chief-executive post , but not before rumors cirulated that the job was Mr. Farah 's .
Midwest retailers have had similar knock-down , drag-outs .
In 1992 , Carson Pirie Scott & Co. sued Sears , Roebuck & Co. after Sears hired Saks Fifth Avenue 's Arthur Martinez to head its merchandising unit .
Carson , then called P.A. Bergner & Co. , alleged that Mr. Martinez already had agreed to sign on as Carson 's chief executive ; Sears settled .
Mr. Martinez subsequently has been credited with much of Sears 's turnaround .
Although demand for top retailing executives is expected to exceed supply for some time to come , industry observers say at least some successors to the current chiefs are in the pipeline .
`` There will be more hot prospects in five years , '' predicts recruiter Barbara Helstrom , of Helstrom Turner .
She cites a new crop of general managers coming up through the ranks and gaining exposure to everything from displaying merchandise to controlling costs to managing employees .
It used to be that department stores dominated the industry and their most-heralded leaders were merchant princes -- executives with flair , an eye for hot merchandise , and little use for numbers .
When today 's leaders sit down with their suppliers , however , `` they talk about what kind of markdown support they can get , rather than whether the garment looks good or not , '' says L. Wayne Hood , an analyst with Prudential Securities .
These changes dismay veteran retailers .
`` There are a lot of technicians but a damn few generals around , '' complains Stanley Marcus , the former Neiman-Marcus chairman known for his eye-catching merchandise .
Mr. Marcus says he once attended hour-long meetings where executives would discuss the merits of a single handbag .
`` Now , it 's how do you make an extra buck , '' he scoffs .
But others in the industry argue that change , sometimes radical , is needed to bring this hidebound industry into the 1990s , where cost cutting and streamlined operations are mandatory for survival .
While hiring from outside the industry is rarely done , hiring from outside the company increasingly is seen as a quick way to gain Wall Street 's confidence .
Kmart Corp. , for one , is actively trying to shed its insular image by publicly stressing that it is willing hire from outside the company to fill key jobs .
The problem is that `` the really good people already have very good jobs .
You ca n't very well hire them away , '' says Mr. Barnard , the consultant .
Indeed , retail executives are among the top-paid leaders in the country relative to their companies ' earnings .
One popular name , Michael Bozic , the former Sears merchandising group head who has been praised for turning around Hills Stores Co. , was paid $ 2.3 million last year -- which amounted to 7.4 times Hills 's earnings .
Noting the musical chairs played by executives at Federated , Macy and Neiman-Marcus , though , Burnham Securities analyst Janet Mangano surmises that `` these people can be bargained for .
'' WASHINGTON -- The Clinton administration 's Superfund bill cleared the House Ways and Means Committee by a voice vote .
The bill now proceeds to the House floor , where it is expected to be voted on in early September .
The bill also awaits action in the Senate Finance Committee and on the Senate floor .
In clearing the House tax-writing committee , the proposed rewrite of the hazardous-waste law picked up support from a one-time vocal opponent , American International Group Inc. , a New York insurer .
The company had differed with the American Insurance Association over how to structure a new $ 8 billion , 10-year tax on insurers .
The tax would raise money for a fund to settle lawsuits between polluting companies and their insurers over who must pay Superfund cleanup costs .
In the end , AIG agreed to support the bill if the tax were restructured to be based mainly on commercial-insurance policies written between 1968 and 1985 for the first four years , and largely on future commercial-insurance policies starting in the fifth year .
Reinsurance companies have objected that the tax would require them to pay more than their share .
But the committee adopted an amendment , offered by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , that allowed reinsurers to pay some of the tax in future years as a fee imposed on reinsurers who settle lawsuits through the new fund .
HONG KONG -- The volume of orders-on-hand for Hong Kong 's 300 largest manufacturers rose 2 % in June from the previous year , the government said .
Manufacturers ' orders-on-hand are orders and parts of orders received earlier by manufacturers for local production that are unfilled by the end of the reference month .
SINGAPORE -- The West is bad , Singapore is good .
That was the gist of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong 's two-hour National Day rally speech .
`` Western liberals , foreign media and human-rights groups want Singapore to be like their societies , and some Singaporeans mindlessly dance to their tune , '' he said .
Mr. Goh even dragged out the case of Michael Fay , the American teenager caned in Singapore for vandalism .
Mr. Fay 's `` parents were outraged and angry with the Singapore government instead of ashamed , '' he said .
In his speech , the prime minister also gave Singapore voters a few presents .
Civil servants , he said , will get a special bonus this year if economic growth tops 9 % , as expected .
Young couples will get a $ 20,000 cash grant to help them buy a home near their parents .
But Mr. Goh took away goodies , too .
Unwed mothers , for instance , will lose the right to buy new government-built flats at a discount , a privilege available to most families in Singapore .
BOSTON -- Checkers champion Marion Tinsley withdrew from a closely watched match against a supercomputer in Boston , citing health problems .
Dr. Tinsley , a 67-year-old former mathematics professor , had played to six draws in a 30-game match against a checkers software program called Chinook , which was created by computer scientist Jonathan Schaeffer and runs on a Silicon Graphics Inc. supercomputer .
The match was the subject of a frontpage article in the Aug. 15 Wall Street Journal .
Dr. Tinsley said hospital tests showed he had an acute pancreas problem and expects to be admitted to a hospital .
`` I 'm terribly disappointed , '' he said .
`` I spent two years of my life preparing for this .
'' The match at the Boston Computer Museum will continue against another human challenger , Don Lafferty , a student of Dr. Tinsley 's for 40 years .
Since 1990 , Mr. Lafferty has played Chinook 55 times , with seven wins , five losses and 43 draws .

ZEDILLO EASILY WON Mexico 's presidential election , exit polls indicated .
The ruling-party candidate drew about 50 % of the vote , according to the polls , while center-right candidate Fernandez had 25 % and Cardenas , the leftist candidate , had 18 % .
The hotly contested election appeared to have been free of violence , but there were allegations of fraud .
Turnout was very heavy , possibly 70 % .
The balloting capped a year that began with an Indian insurrection and saw the assassination of the first candidate of the PRI , which has ruled Mexico for 65 years .
Cardenas , whom many Mexicans believe was defrauded of victory in 1988 , has called for a series of rallies today , spurring fears of violence .
THE HOUSE APPROVED a compromise crime bill , reversing a Clinton defeat .
The 235-195 vote sent to the Senate a more conservative package than a Clinton-backed proposal effectively killed in a procedural vote 10 days earlier .
Moderate Republicans provided the margin of victory , joining a majority of Democrats to defeat procedural attempts to stymie it and then voting for the bill itself .
It would trim $ 3.3 billion from the earlier measure , two-thirds of which would come from programs favored by liberal Democrats .
In the $ 30.2 billion compromise , $ 23.3 billion is allocated for law enforcement and prisons and $ 6.9 billion is earmarked for crime-prevention programs .

Motorola Inc. agreed to an unusual settlement of patent litigation with inventor Jerome Lemelson , a victory in Mr. Lemelson 's long-standing campaign to wrest royalties from large U.S. corporations .
Motorola , based in Schaumburg , Ill. , agreed to pay an undisclosed amount of money to Mr. Lemelson 's philanthropic foundation , which makes charitable contributions to promote innovation and technology .
The company also will co-sponsor educational programs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Arizona State University and other selected institutions .
The company can choose from among projects proposed by the foundation , but the agreement sets a minimum financial commitment .
`` It 's confidential , but it 's a big number , '' said Jerry Hosier , Mr. Lemelson 's attorney , of the financial settlement .
`` Motorola is going to actively participate in the programs with their people .
'' Donald Banner , a veteran patent attorney and former U.S. patent commissioner , termed the agreement `` very unusual .
'' He said such agreements could have positive social benefits .
`` We need all the innovation we can get .
'' Mr. Lemelson , a 71-year-old resident of Incline Village , Nev. , is one of the most prolific U.S. inventors .
He holds more than 500 patents , many dating from the 1950s and 1960s , in areas ranging from toy trucks to fax machines and camcorders .
He is frequently in litigation with major companies , which often complain that he received broad patents for general concepts without ever developing working models of his inventions .
His most recent crusade involves a series of 17 patents including machine vision , bar codes and other technologies and processes used in making cars , semiconductors and other products .
Mr. Hosier said major European and Japanese electronics companies have so far paid a total of about $ 500 million for licenses .
The Japanese companies typically paid $ 15 million to $ 60 million apiece , he said .
But major U.S. companies dug in their heels .
Ford Motor Co. , Chrysler Corp. , General Motors Corp. and Motorola filed suits in October 1992 to invalidate Mr. Lemelson 's patents .
He countersued , alleging patent infringement .
`` Previously we had been confronted with a solid wall of resistance in the United States , '' Mr. Hosier said .
`` The Motorola settlement is a watershed .
'' In a statement , Motorola said : `` During the course of our discussions with Mr. Lemelson , we discovered a significant shared commitment to educational programs designed to stimulate inventions and innovation and develop a new work force prepared for tomorrow 's high-tech world .
'' Executives of the auto makers were n't available for a comment .
`` Will it cause others to knuckle under ?
I do n't think so , '' said Ronald Laurie , a patent attorney in Menlo Park , Calif. , who is familiar with Mr. Lemelson 's record .
But he added that recent rulings by courts upholding patent laws make it riskier for companies to take patent disputes through trial , which could put them out of business .
WHITE PLAINS , N.Y. -- Texaco Inc. said it signed a memo of understanding with Norsk Hydro AS that would create a joint venture to sell petroleum products in Norway and Denmark .

Texaco and Norsk Hydro , a Norwegian chemical and energy concern , will each hold a 50 % interest in the venture .
LONDON -- To investors thinking about diving into the choppy waters of Europe 's emerging markets , now is the time to leap in , but wear a life jacket .
The region 's developing markets have enormous potential , particularly with Europe 's economy in general seemingly poised for a robust recovery , analysts said .
Equally promising , many emerging-market companies , especially in Central and Eastern Europe , have carved out lucrative export markets by taking advantage of low labor costs at home .
But anyone tempted by triple-digit annual gains posted over the past year by some stocks in markets such as Warsaw , Budapest , Prague , Lisbon and Istanbul should know that about as many stocks have plunged by similar margins .
Information about companies in Europe 's emerging markets is still patchy and in some cases almost nonexistent .
Many companies in Eastern Europe , for example , publish results just once a year and only in the local language .
Other impediments for direct stock investments in these markets are the commission charges for buying and selling shares .
In most cases , individual investors must go through a broker in their home markets who in turn go through brokers in emerging markets .
The alternative would be to set up a brokerage account in Warsaw , for example , but this would involve establishing a separate bank account and paying additional charges .
Most emerging-market analysts agree than anyone lacking foreign-language expertise , with limited time to tend investments and with less than about $ 100,000 to spare should invest in the region 's newest markets through a mutual fund with varied holdings .
Generally , it is safer to have a fund that invests in a few dozen stocks rather than a handful of companies that may be selected simply because they are the best-known in a particular market .
Analysts recommend a healthy dose of caution , too .
Most investments in Europe 's emerging markets should be made with the idea of leaving the money in for at least three to five years -- and then only a small percentage of one 's portfolio .
Funds investing in European emerging markets have performed well over the past 12 months , gaining an average of 27 % , compared with an average 17 % gain by funds invested in Europe 's mainstream markets .
But performances over a longer period present a different picture .
Emerging-market funds in Europe are up 34 % over three years , while general European stock funds are up 35 % .
The superior performance by general equity funds results largely because Europe 's emerging markets took a while to get going .
It has only been in about the past 18 months that those markets began to take off , because of investments by large foreign institutional investors and domestic investors , especially in Poland .
Bourses from Lisbon to Istanbul also are being run more professionally than ever before , with most trading five days a week and listing several dozen companies .
Until about two years ago , most emerging markets in Europe each had fewer than 20 stocks listed .
Analysts recommended that investors try newer funds , because they are unburdened by lackluster companies that some older funds bought when those assets were the only ones available .
It is important to look at a fund 's track record over several years , which analysts said should comfortably outpace the average of all funds in the sector .
This is sometimes difficult for European emerging-market funds , almost all of which began only in the 1990s .
And volatility is worth checking , that is , how much a fund swings up and down over a given period ; wide swings are n't necessarily bad , and some volatility is probably inevitable in immature markets with great profit potential , such as Turkey 's , but huge peaks and valleys can cause insomnia .
If a long track record is n't available , analysts suggested investors go for funds managed by well-known banks and investment firms that have good contacts in emerging markets .
And it is important to consider the currency in which a fund is denominated , as devaluations or declines in foreign-exchange dealings can hurt a fund 's performance when translating back into the home currency .

Can you make real money giving good health care to the poor ?
`` Forget it , '' skeptics would say .
But physician Julius Combs and his United American Healthcare Corp. are proving naysayers wrong .
The unusual Detroit health-care management company takes health care directly to patients , many of whom are poor or destitute .
Such patients commonly wait until they are very sick before they seek care in costly emergency rooms .
United American successfully reaches many of these patients sooner , often by treating them at home and by promoting preventive care .
The concern also has lowered health-care costs for Medicaid patients through a strategy of health education .
United American develops and manages health-maintenance organizations and health-care systems for government medical programs and corporations .
The company avoids the high costs and risks often involved with ownership of health facilities .
It does n't own any .
United American , with about 200,000 patients in 42 states , is dwarfed by HMO giants such as U.S. Healthcare Inc. and United HealthCare Corp. .
But United American has outperformed those companies over the past five years with an average annual return on equity in excess of 40 % .
United American officials say they agree with analysts ' estimates that net income exceeded $ 6.5 million for fiscal 1994 , which ended June 30 .
That would be up nearly 40 % from the year earlier .
Analysts estimate that revenue surpassed $ 40 million , up 40 % from $ 29 million in fiscal 1993 .
The company 's patient base has grown 30 % a year over the past five years .
`` They 've done well because they provide efficient delivery of health-care services for Medicaid patients , '' says Gary Prestopino , director of research at Mesirow Financial , a Chicago investment firm .
He cites United American 's emphasis on caring for such patients in less costly settings than emergency rooms .
Mr. Prestopino and other health-care analysts believe the company is poised for further growth in light of the current national focus on managed care and coverage for the uninsured and Medicaid recipients .
`` The major problem for much of the poorer population is that they lack access to the health-care system , '' explains Dr. Combs , a 63-year-old gynecologist and United American 's chairman and chief executive officer .
`` If you can devise a system that increases access , the tremendous cost of providing good health care can be drastically reduced , '' he adds .
In Detroit , for instance , United American provides home therapy to patients who are unable to visit a clinic .
`` For many , transportation is n't always available , '' says Dr. Combs .
The health-care company also dispatches physicians into poor urban areas to give children routine immunizations at home .
Dr. Combs notes , `` It 's much cheaper to get them immunized than to try to treat the disease later .
'' The company 's prevention program covers prenatal care as well .
Recognizing the high cost of treating difficult pregnancies , especially in an emergency setting , it has developed an extensive outreach program to identify and keep track of poor , pregnant women who otherwise might not obtain any prenatal care .
United American recently allied with Healthscope Administrative Services Corp. , a manager of medical-care services in New York .
Healthscope , working with the Catholic Medical Services Center , serves the nation 's largest pool of Medicaid patients .
United American is supplying management assistance and lending money to Healthscope , which has had a difficult time getting support for its work .
Dr. Combs says that the relationship will enable Healthscope to enroll more Medicaid patients and increase the use of Catholic Medical Center hospitals , thereby also putting the hospitals on a better financial footing .
Success has n't come easy for United American , however .
The company had to battle a host of skeptical bureaucrats and Wall Street bankers .
Among other things , health-care regulators and investment bankers are n't used to dealing with African-American entrepreneurs , Dr. Combs , an African-American , says .
The physician became involved with HMOs as a board member of Michigan HMO , which is now OmniCare Health Plan , a nonprofit group in Detroit .
During the Carter administration , Dr. Combs and two other officials decided to convert the HMO into a profit-making concern .
They abandoned the idea because state regulators wanted the HMO to pay the state several million dollars before it converted .
Instead , the trio decided to form a management company that would receive fees for giving OmniCare administrative services .
Still , the regulators balked .
They worried that the proposed relationship would harm Omnicare and increase overall health-care costs .
United American spent five years and more than $ 1 million before Michigan regulators finally relented in 1983 .
Though Omnicare continues to provide most of United American 's revenue , Dr. Combs has used start-ups , acquisitions and joint ventures to extend the company 's operations far beyond Michigan .
United American went public in 1991 .
Very few investment banks showed any interest in the company .
Some investment bankers even indicated to Dr. Combs that they liked the company , but were waiting to meet `` the real people '' in charge .
United American went public at $ 9 a share , nearly 30 % more than projected by the first investment bank the company hired .
The stock , which now trades on the New York Stock Exchange , closed Friday at $ 19 .
American General Corp. , seeking to tread new ground in takeover law , sued Unitrin Inc. 's board , asking a Delaware court to force the Chicago-based insurer to negotiate a merger with its hostile suitor .
The Houston-based insurance company also asked the Delaware Chancery Court to block Unitrin 's plan to buy back as much as 19 % of its stock .
Unitrin 's board has rejected American General 's takeover proposal of $ 50.375 a share , or $ 2.6 billion , saying the company is n't for sale .
The board also adopted a `` poison pill '' takeover defense and authorized the stock buyback .
Poison-pill tactics are designed to make hostile takeovers prohibitively expensive .
American General 's lawsuit relies on -- but also goes beyond -- a landmark ruling this year by the Delaware Supreme Court in a case involving Paramount Communications Inc. .
In that decision , the court ruled that if a company takes an action that would result in a change in corporate control -- such as taking steps to sell the company -- its board has a duty to get the best deal for shareholders , which usually means selling to the highest bidder .
The American General lawsuit argues that the stock buyback would result in a change of control because it would increase the ownership stake of five Unitrin directors , led by former Chairman Henry Singleton , to 28 % from 23 % .
Unitrin 's bylaws call for 75 % shareholder approval to sell the company .
So if the five directors own more than 25 % , they can block a deal .
Therefore , the suit concludes , the buyback would shift control of the company from `` a fluid aggregation of unaffiliated stockholders '' to the five directors .
Takeover lawyers say the argument is clever but might not succeed because the court could conclude that the five directors already control Unitrin and that the buyback would only increase their control .
Even with only a 23 % stake , the directors could probably block a merger because it is rare for even 90 % of a company 's stockholders to vote in a takeover battle .
The law on this issue , however , is far from settled .
`` The idea of a change in control is one of the most ill-defined terms in corporate takeover law , '' said Lawrence Cunningham , a professor at Yeshiva University 's Cardozo Law School in New York .
Even without the buyback , the lawsuit contends , the board has breached its fiduciary duty by refusing to meet with American General and investigate its proposal .
Mr. Cunningham said Unitrin 's directors may have a duty at least to listen to American General and find out its best offer .
But he called it `` an uphill battle '' to ask , as American General does , that Unitrin be compelled to negotiate a merger .
Unitrin , which contends that shareholders would get the best long-term value by sticking with current management , declined to comment on the suit .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading , Unitrin stock was unchanged Friday at $ 50.25 a share .
The stock was trading at $ 39.75 just before American General disclosed its bid Aug. 2 .
Aside from the issue of a change in control , American General asserts that the buyback is illegal because it would coerce Unitrin 's shareholders to sell their shares out of fear that the board will succeed in rebuffing American General , causing Unitrin 's stock price to tumble .
Unitrin started buying shares under the buyback last week , according to people on Wall Street , but the amount acquired so far is n't known .
Takeover lawyers suggest the real motivation of the lawsuit might be to show Unitrin that American General does n't intend to back down and is ready to make Unitrin directors give hours of grueling depositions unless they capitulate .

In its first leap overseas , Wal-Mart Stores Inc. formed a joint venture to open three to four stores in Hong Kong this fall and eventually to operate discount stores and membership warehouse clubs in China .
The Hong Kong stores would be Wal-Mart 's first outside North America .
The giant retailer plans to operate stores in Brazil and Argentina , but those are n't expected to open until next year .
Wal-Mart said the Hong Kong stores will be miniature membership warehouse clubs , 10,000 to 20,000 square feet in size -- and would be by far the company 's tiniest stores .
By comparison , the average size of the company 's Sam 's Clubs here in the U.S. is 100,000 square feet .
Wal-Mart has n't set a date to move into China but has identified sites in Shenzhen and Shanghai .
Its joint-venture partner will be Ek Chor Distribution System Co. , a unit of C.P. Pokphand Co. of Hong Kong , in which Thailand-based Charoen Pokphand Group , an agri-industrial conglomerate , holds a controlling interest .
C.P. Pokphand already is involved in 55 other Chinese joint ventures , mostly in agricultural or industrial production .
Though the company had been investigating opportunities in China , most analysts were surprised by the announcement of the venture late Friday .
In an interview earlier this year , S. Robson Walton , Wal-Mart 's chairman , said of China that `` the time line for going in there is going to be pretty darned long .
'' In a recent report , Jeffrey M. Feiner , an analyst at Salomon Brothers , noted that while retail sales have been growing rapidly in China , lack of infrastructure remains a problem for foreign retailers .
Under Chinese regulations , foreign retailers must operate through joint ventures , and are limited to operating in 11 major cities .
Regulations also bar foreign operators from wholesale sales , though the implications of that for Wal-Mart 's warehouse club plans was n't immediately apparent .
The Chinese government also requires foreign operators to generate at least half their sales volume from Chinese-made goods .
Orphanages are almost extinct in the U.S. , but orphans are not .
More than 400,000 children now live in foster homes , and unknown thousands more live nominally at home but actually as latch-key children surviving on the mean streets of America with no fathers , crack-abusing mothers and drug-dealers as role models .
America once provided orphanages for many children .
In 1910 , about 123,000 lived in such places , or about three out of every 1,000 persons under the age of 21 .
Today these institutions have almost disappeared .
Most people think -- wrongly , as we shall see -- that they vanished because they had failed .
Mention `` orphanage '' to someone and the image that springs to mind is of Oliver Twist begging for another bowl of gruel in a bleak prison .
The negative view of orphanages has been reinforced by historians who , writing in the late 1960s and early 1970s , reinterpreted the late-19th-century impulse to help children as a form of class-conscious `` social control .
'' What previously had been seen as a public-spirited effort to impart decent values was now seen as an effort to impose suspect -LRB- that is , `` middle-class '' -RRB- values .
An especially sharp-edged version of the social-control theory was set forth in Anthony Platt 's 1974 book , `` The Child Savers .
'' A more nuanced but even more influential variant on the same theory was David Rothman 's 1971 `` The Discovery of the Asylum .
'' These writings helped to convince a generation of scholars and activists that prisons , asylums and orphanages were institutions designed by the privileged classes to ensure control over poor people .
Today , however , a new group of historians has produced evidence that casts great doubt on the social-control view .
A particularly good example by Nurith Zmora was published this year under the title `` Orphanages Reconsidered '' -LRB- Temple University Press -RRB- .
It examines three such institutions in Baltimore -LRB- one Catholic , one Jewish , and one Protestant -RRB- out of the 28 , all privately run , that existed there in 1910 .
Ms. Zmora 's conclusions can be simply stated : The orphanages were decent places run by caring professionals who maintained close ties to the community .
The children were housed in adequate physical facilities , offered good food and hygiene , and supplied a better education than they would have received elsewhere .
Though problems existed , they were grappled with by public and private agencies that shared the view that helping children was not the same thing as indoctrinating them .
Ms. Zmora was able to trace the later lives of 45 graduates .
Most did quite well , finding jobs and becoming self-supporting .
Most of the youngsters in these institutions were not literally orphans .
They were , instead , children whose parents , owing to poverty or disorganization , could not adequately care for them and who were enrolled voluntarily .
Half entered before they were nine years old , and several before they were six ; the average stay was about five years , though a few stayed for more than 10 .
The orphanages did not take incorrigible children .
In a sense , these institutions were not orphanages but boarding schools that charged no tuition .
Consider , for example , the Samuel Ready School , founded in the early 1870s to help orphaned girls of any religion , although most were Protestant .
The school was used by impoverished single mothers as either a temporary shelter or a boarding school for their daughters .
The Ready School was a pleasant place in a parklike setting that provided its students with better surroundings than they had enjoyed at home .
The food was adequate , but probably no more appealing than any institutional fare .
Of the first 40 girls to enter Ready , 29 completed their education there and 11 were expelled or withdrawn by relatives .
Of those finishing , most studied dressmaking or secretarial skills .
The school devoted great efforts to finding jobs for their graduates , mostly as clerks , dressmakers and teachers .
It was not easy , because growing up in an orphanage carried a stigma .
Nevertheless , Ms. Zmora reports that of 26 girls who entered between 1887 and 1889 and finished their vocational training , 23 got jobs in their fields .
Other orphanages were less devoted to vocational training .
At the Dolan School for Irish youngsters , some children eventually returned to their families while others were `` placed out '' in foster families .
It was hard to be sure that the foster parents took adequate care of their charges , and so some of the latter ran away -- sometimes back to Dolan .
Some scholars , such as Michael Sherraden , have suggested that these institutions were a way of coping with an important change in the labor market .
Before 1870 , children , even very young ones , worked ; after the 1870s , there was less demand for and much opposition to child labor , and the orphanages were an alternative to living on the street or with parents who were unable to support them .
The so-called orphanages were a way for children to get the benefits of middle-class life despite having parents who had not entered that status .
These institutions did not disappear because an enlightened public was shocked by stories of abuse and neglect within their walls .
On the contrary , they were destroyed by their success and the ideology of their rivals .
So popular did they become , so great was the demand for places in them , that private charities could no longer afford them and public agencies refused to make up the difference .
Social workers opposed them because they `` broke up the family , '' liberal reformers because they involved `` social control , '' fiscal conservatives because they were too expensive .
Orphanages -LRB- or free boarding schools -RRB- still exist , but in reduced numbers .
Boys Town is one that has not only survived but prospered .
Mary-Lou Weisman recently gave a vivid account of its successes in an Atlantic Monthly article .
But everywhere the idea is in retreat because critics think that such places just `` warehouse '' children -LRB- that was never true -RRB- and that a better alternative is to provide money that will enable parents to take care of their own children -LRB- that may have been true once , but it is n't now -RRB- .
Incompetent or abusive parents existed when boarding schools flourished ; they exist today .
But today , unlike a century ago , the ideology of `` family preservation '' has intervened with its plausible but overly broad message that a child is invariably better off with his parents .
It is an appealing idea and an inexpensive one to boot , since supporting the child in his family or in a foster family is cheaper than caring for him in an institution .
But not all families are worth preserving .
Indeed , the dramatic increase in single-parent families suggests that there is a declining number of true families worth preserving .
And the main current alternative to the biological parent -- namely , foster-family care -- has its own problems .
Many foster families simply can not handle the kind of children they are now getting .
And all foster families are hard to oversee to ensure that the best interests of the child are being served .
We do n't know as much as we should about how well institutional care might function under contemporary conditions .
Such evidence as exists suggests that troubled teenagers may do well while in boarding schools but do poorly when returned to their families and communities .
On the other hand , very young children placed in such schools before they become troubled may -LRB- no one knows for certain -RRB- do as well today as their predecessors did in turn-of-the century Baltimore .
Careful studies can answer these questions .
Foster care has an important role to play -- for some children .
But for others institutional care is necessary .
At least the research of writers such as Nurith Zmora , Michael Sherraden and Mary-Lou Weisman is making it harder to argue that boarding schools and orphanages are discredited alternatives .

An investor who exposed five brokerage houses to $ 2.9 million in potential losses in a `` free-riding '' scheme was sentenced to 27 months in prison and ordered to pay nearly $ 550,000 in restitution .
Peter S. Adler , 50 years old , of New York and Miami , previously pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud committed between 1987 and 1990 and another count of bank fraud in a 1992 scheme .
Mr. Adler , incarcerated for the past 16 months , is expected to serve only 11 more months to complete the sentence .
Mr. Adler 's lawyer , Bobbi Sternheim , had sought a lighter sentence , arguing that Mr. Adler suffered from diminished mental capacity as a result of psychological problems and addictions to cocaine and medication .
But U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in federal court in Manhattan said a harsher sentence was appropriate .
`` He knew what he was doing basically , '' the judge said .
`` He had the wit and the ability to calculate these fraudulent transactions .
'' Mr. Adler was accused of using shell corporations and fraudulent cash transfers to mislead the brokerage firms about the amount of money he had available to cover stock purchases .
In a free-riding scheme , an investor buys stock with little or no money down .
If the stock price goes up , the investor sells it , reimburses the brokerage firm that put up the purchase price , and pockets the difference .
If the stock drops in value , the brokerage firms are n't reimbursed .
Mr. Adler will make restitution of $ 278,296 to PaineWebber Group Inc. , First Fidelity Brokers Inc. , Datek Securities Corp. , GKN Securities Corp. , and KW Brown Investments .
He also was ordered to make restitution of $ 270,000 to Valley Bank of Nevada for the bank fraud .
Mr. Adler previously paid $ 230,164 to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission suit .

Saratoga Springs , N.Y. -- Think two against one is n't fair ?
Think again .
It all depends on who 's the one .
Holy Bull was the one Saturday afternoon at Saratoga Race Course , even though he wore the number two .
The dark gray colt won the Travers Stakes , America 's oldest , against , among two others , a two-horse entry from trainer D. Wayne Lukas 's phalanx .
Lukas 's plan was for Commanche Trail , a briefly swift but otherwise undistinguished beast , to play the `` rabbit , '' outspeeding the speedy Holy Bull in the early going before giving way .
Then Tabasco Cat , the trainer 's Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner , would finish off H.B. in the homestretch .
Two horses would indeed duel for the lead down the stretch , all right , but Tabasco Cat would have only a backseat look at them .
Concern , at odds of 5-to-1 the third-longest shot in a field with but four betting interests , whizzed by Tabasco Cat about pi-mile into the 1D-mile race , and had the backers of the favored Holy Bull choking on chalk dust in the final strides .
Concern failed , though , by a neck .
How did you feel during the closing dash ?
Holy Bull 's septuagenarian owner and trainer , W.A. `` Jimmy '' Croll , was asked later .
`` I was concerned , '' he replied .
To hear the experts tell it , Croll had quite a bit to be concerned about going into the race that could determine the voting for three-year-old colt of the year , and , maybe , even for the best Thoroughbred , period .
Holy Bull had steamed through the spring as a putative wonder horse , but picked a bad race in which to have a bad race .
That was the Kentucky Derby , the one race people watch when they 're watching only one .
He got off poorly on a muddy Churchill Downs track , mucked around in the pack , and wound up a much-maligned 12th .
Sure , he came back later to win three pretty good races , but questions remained .
Could he win at the 1D-mile `` classic '' distance , the Derby route ?
Could he handle a track that was n't Sahara dry ?
Could he win without an early lead , something he had n't been asked to do in a dozen previous outings ?
Okay , those things do n't exactly touch on the meaning of life , but we 're talkin ' sports .
Truth to tell , if the throng that showed up here on Saturday had been polled , it 'd be doubtful if a majority confessed much interest in the above queries .
Just as the rustic Saratoga track , in the broad-avenued old sitz bath town of Saratoga Springs , is a unique sporting venue , the Travers , its annual showcase , is a unique race .
It shares with the Indianapolis 500 the distinction of being the sports event least watched by the people who attend it .
At Indy , most of the annual crowd of 350,000-odd -LRB- and I do mean odd -RRB- are up to devilry in the infield while the autos zoom .
At the Travers , a veritable lawnchair and blanket armada shows up early to stake out choice places behind the rambling grandstand on which to picnic while the ponies run .
Yes , many of them bet , but most do n't bother to arise from their refreshments even to watch the races on the TV sets staked atop poles around the grounds .
One group of eight young women I spoke to revealed that their betting strategy was for each to bet a different horse in each race , so that at least one always would emerge happy .
When one notes that the track seats about 18,000 people , and that Saturday 's announced attendance was 46,395 , many must have been in that category .
Aside from its age -LRB- it 's been contested 125 times since 1864 -RRB- , the Travers is best known as the `` graveyard of favorites .
'' This rep began in earnest with its 1930 running -LRB- remember ?
-RRB- , when Jim Dandy , a 100-to-1 shot , upset the Triple Crown winner Gallant Fox .
Since then , such notable peeple 's cherces as Tom Fool , Affirmed and Alysheba have eaten dirt in the contest .
But Whirlaway , Native Dancer , Buckpasser , Damascus and 38 others have prevailed as favorites in the last 91 runnings , so the hex hardly amounts to a headlock .
Holy Bull , a winner of 10 of 12 coming in , figured to be favored , and he was , at odds of 4-to-5 .
But his handlers had non-historical worries .
One was a storm that dumped considerable rain on the area Thursday , leaving a track classed as muddy when racing began at 1 p.m. on a warm , hazy Saturday .
The other was Lukas 's Tabasco Cat-Commanche Trail entry .
Tabasco Cat was the tiger of the pair .
He finished sixth in the Kentucky Derby , but stuck around to win the Preakness and Belmont while Holy Bull grazed before returning against lesser company .
Lukas , a fan of college sports , used the language of that form to underscore his notion that his horse rated the nod on the basis of superior competition .
`` We did n't play any Division II schools , '' said he .
Nonetheless , racing 's Dr. Teeth did n't feel that Tabasco Cat was up to tackling Holy Bull alone ; thus , the double team .
And , indeed , shortly after the gate opened at about 5 p.m. on an oval rated as `` fast '' but still a bit sticky , Commache Trail zipped off first just outside Holy Bull , and Tabasco Cat lurked on his right haunch .
But when Commanche Trail faded , Tabasco Cat faded , too , leaving the race to Holy Bull and Concern .
The latter always runs late , but mostly too late -- he 'd won just three times in 17 previous starts .
It 's three of 18 now , but with more respect .
Tabasco Cat had to struggle to edge Unaccounted For for third , 17 lengths back .
Owner-trainer Croll , who 'd received Holy Bull as a bequest , refused to comment on Lukas 's loosing a rabbit on his charge , which was a comment itself .
Croll did say he thought his steed was , now , No. 1 in his class .
`` He did what he had to do , '' he declared .
The three-year-old picture is n't fully painted yet .
Holy Bull will race once more this year , probably at Belmont Park next month , while Tabasco Cat is scheduled to go on to November 's Breeders Cup .
There he might meet Kentucky Derby winner Go For Gin and also Strodes Creek , Charlie Whittingham 's big stretch runner who keeps threatening to win something big .
But for now , this is clear : The Bull can run .

FISCHER IMAGING Corp. -LRB- Denver -RRB- -- Morgan W. Nields , 48-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of this medical imaging systems maker , was named to the additional posts of interim president and chief operating officer .
He assumes the duties of Roberto A. Cascella , 39 , who resigned to pursue other interests .
NEW YORK -- Viacom Inc. and Tele-Communications Inc. have hit a snag in negotiations to settle a bitter dispute through a transaction in which Viacom would sell assets , including the Madison Square Garden sports properties , to TCI , people close to the situation said .
According to people in both camps , the stumbling block in the long-running and difficult talks is price .
Each side is also accusing the other of reneging on understandings supposedly reached earlier in the talks .
However , neither side apparently has abandoned the attempt to reach a settlement .
Each is accusing the other of going public with the differences in an effort to gain a negotiating advantage .
Both Viacom and TCI declined to comment on the status of the talks .
As reported , Viacom filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against TCI and affiliates that accused them of engaging in a conspiracy to dominate the cable-television industry .
The suit was filed during the bitter takoever battle for Paramount Communications Inc. , in which Viacom prevailed over QVC Inc. .
TCI had backed QVC in the battle .
Since then , Viacom and TCI have held talks toward settling the dispute .
Among other things , the discussions have involved TCI 's possibly acquiring Viacom 's cable systems in addition to the Madison Square Garden assets .
A deal involving the cable operations , which serve about one million customers , could be valued at as much as $ 2.5 billion .
Viacom is seeking at least $ 1 billion for the Garden operations .
In addition to TCI , a partnership of ITT Corp. and Cablevision Systems Inc. is also seeking to acquire the Garden .
CAMBRIDGE , Mass. -- Historian Frank Sulloway says it is only natural that he has spent 24 years plotting to overthrow reigning ideas in his field .
After all , he 's a later-born .
Based on a massive statistical analysis of many of those who shaped the past , Dr. Sulloway has detected a grand pattern .
Forget Adam Smith 's invisible hand , Karl Marx 's class struggles and Sigmund Freud 's Oedipal clashes , he says .
Radical change in human affairs is wrought by the perennial rivalry between eldest children and their younger siblings .
Later-borns are more open-minded than firstborns , says Dr. Sulloway .
They are `` born to rebel , '' take risks and explode accepted wisdoms .
Charles Darwin , Igor Stravinsky and Rachel Carson were later-borns .
So was Victorian novelist George Eliot , who renounced religion and lived adulterously with her married mentor .
Some others : Marx , Lenin , Castro , Ho Chi Minh , Ralph Nader , Marlon Brando , Anita Hill and Bill Gates .
Firstborns tend to stiffly support the status quo , says Dr. Sulloway , a guest scholar at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
They are status-conscious and often emerge as leaders .
But when faced with revolutionary change , they try to slam on the brakes .
John Adams , Calvin Coolidge and Ayn Rand were firstborns .
So are Chief Justice William Rehnquist and radio host Rush Limbaugh .
To many researchers , this sounds like pop-psychology poppycock from a talkshow wannabe .
`` A lot of academics think this whole area is rubbish , '' says Steven Peterson , a political-science professor at Alfred University in New York and co-author of skeptical articles on birth-order effects .
But Dr. Sulloway has built a formidable case .
Says Harvard University psychologist Jerome Kagan , who has read a draft of Dr. Sulloway 's nearly completed , 800-page report : `` A lot of people are going to be bothered by his very important result .
We tend to think personality comes either from genes or what parents do to children .
'' Dr. Sulloway shows that a third crucial influence `` is having a sibling , '' which tends to polarize people into conformist and maverick camps .
-LRB- Single children typically are centrists in the `` open-mindedness '' spectrum , says Dr. Sulloway .
-RRB- Partly supported by a $ 192,000 grant from the MacArthur Foundation , Dr. Sulloway has worked since 1970 on a huge biographical database .
It now has more than 300,000 entries on 6,000 people involved in 30 scientific and social revolutions over the past 500 years -- essentially everyone swept up in the upheavals that he could find biographies on .
He enlisted 108 scholars to independently rate dozens of `` descriptors '' about his subjects , such as their levels of shyness , piety and political liberalism , then melded the ratings .
Want to know why Prussia 's Frederick the Great remained calm when Voltaire publicized his homosexual escapades ?
Why Charles Darwin waited almost 20 years before publishing his theory of evolution ?
Why Margaret Mead was easily hoodwinked by the Samoans about their sexual mores ?
Tapping keys on his computer , Dr. Sulloway can generate correlations suggesting answers -- a way of approaching history , he says , that is analogous to the statistical methods used by medical detectives to trace the causes of mysterious diseases .
Critics may quibble about details of his work , Dr. Sulloway says , but his main finding is overwhelming : In every revolution , birth order emerges from the statistical mist -- it best explains how people responded to radical new ideas , dwarfing influences historians traditionally study , such as social class .
In the late 1500s , later-borns were twice as likely as firstborns to accept Copernicus 's idea that the Earth revolves around the sun .
In the 1850s , later-borns were five times more likely to accept then-radical ideas about evolution .
Later-borns also pounced on wrong new ideas : In the 1830s , they were twice as likely to buy into phrenology , the theory that bumps on the skull reveal personality .
Later-borns also led the way during the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment , an 18th-century flowering of science and liberal politics .
Firstborns joined backlashes .
Without later-borns like Voltaire , opines Dr. Sulloway , the Enlightenment might have been delayed a century .
Dr. Sulloway is so confident of his findings that he sometimes tosses off predictions about individuals ' birth order based on behavior .
When the names Nelson Mandela -LRB- `` a later-born '' -RRB- and Carlos the Jackal -LRB- firstborn -RRB- came up , he guessed right .
Dr. Sulloway , who resembles actor William Powell , sees himself as a typical later-born .
`` I 'm 47 years old and have no car , no house , no job and no pension , '' he says .
After receiving a doctorate in history from Harvard in 1978 , he was poised to roll down a tenure track .
He jumped the rails to pursue pet projects .
The first one culminated with a myth-busting book that showed how Freud cleverly cobbled borrowed ideas , largely wrong , and passed them off as landmark theories to promote himself as a seminal thinker .
The book made a splash -LRB- Newsweek called it `` fascinating '' -RRB- , but instead of settling down , Dr. Sulloway trekked into the quagmire of birth-order research .
He joined a large crowd .
Scientists have churned out more than 2,000 studies on the subject .
Some classify firstborns as introspective , resigned and fearful ; other studies peg them as rebellious and assertive .
Surveys show firstborns are overrepresented among eminent people , including Supreme Court justices , women mayors and Nobel laureates .
One study found that a strikingly high percentage of stripteasers are firstborns .
Meanwhile , researchers say later-borns are ambitious , cooperative , extroverted , empathizing and popular .
Later-borns reportedly are more likely than eldest siblings to smoke marijuana or work the night shift .
In the 1920s , psychiatrist Alfred Adler claimed to have it all figured out .
Firstborns , he explained , are spoiled by doting parents , then `` dethroned '' by the birth of siblings .
They tend to become power-hungry conservatives -- and sometimes rebellious -- because of a subconscious fixation on restoring past pre-eminence .
Middleborns , sharing parental attention from the first , are more cooperative than firstborns .
But they often become highly competitive striving to catch up with older siblings , hence generally turn out more talented and successful than firstborns .
Youngest children , firmly enthroned , often become spoiled and lazy .
But they tend to feel inferior to their siblings and sometimes become competitive .
Like fortune-cookie forecasts , this theory was roomy enough to fit almost anyone .
Indeed , birth-order gurus , stretching to explain a welter of conflicting data , tend to be vague , lax , confused and wrong , according to Swiss researchers Cecile Ernst and Jules Angst .
In 1983 , they wrote a scathing review of 1,200 birth-order studies .
Widely regarded in academia as definitive , it showed the studies added up to a contradictory mess .
`` This kind of research is a sheer waste of time and money , '' they concluded in a rare display of temper .
Dr. Sulloway agrees -- with certain exceptions .
`` Ernst and Angst threw out the baby with the bath water , '' he asserts , including some 200 relatively rigorous birth-order studies that , statistically combined , support his view on birth order and open-mindedness .
In another heretical twist , Dr. Sulloway chucks traditional psychological analysis in favor of biology to explain his findings .
Food often was scarce among prehistoric hunter\/gatherers , he says , forcing siblings to vie hard for parental handouts .
Those who got less died .
Now siblings are genetically predisposed to compete , polarizing them into family `` niches , '' such as conformers vs. iconoclasts .
Indeed , various studies show siblings are little more alike in personality than people drawn randomly from the population , he says .
Linking this to birth order , Dr. Sulloway speculates that when starvation loomed in the bad old days , parents fed eldest siblings first .
Since they were less likely than younger offspring to die from disease or starvation , they were the best bets to survive and pass on genes .
Remnants of this abound .
Various societies practice infanticide when resources are scarce , but none sacrifice firstborns .
In ancient Japan , younger siblings were called `` cold rice , '' because they were fed after eldest sons .
British wags have nicknamed Prince Charles 's sons the `` heir '' and the `` spare .
'' Eons of this favoritism , says Dr. Sulloway , etched marks on our genes that dictate the niches rival siblings occupy today : Being firstborn switches on a primordial tendency -- one of multiple genetic `` programs '' each person carries but does n't necessarily express -- to identify with parental authority and support the status quo .
Similarly , younger siblings are biologically primed to buck the system .
With less to lose than firstborns , they become the family risk takers -- surveys of college athletes indicate later-borns prefer such sports as rugby and football , while firstborns play tennis and golf .
While controversial , this theory may finally bring natural law and order to birth-order research .
Says biologist Ernst Mayr , Harvard professor emeritus : Dr. Sulloway 's `` admirable '' theory , `` once stated , seems almost obvious .
'' Still , not everyone fits neatly into Dr. Sulloway 's scheme .
Revolutionary scientist Isaac Newton , for example , was a firstborn .
But most such cases , says Dr. Sulloway , illustrate another part of his theory : Birth-order effects can be offset by certain factors .
For instance , a shy temperament can mask a last-born 's radical ways , while conflict with parents can make a firstborn rebellious .
Newton 's father died before he was born ; the famous physicist hated his stepfather and once threatened to burn his house .
Dr. Sulloway 's greatest difficulties were posed by the French Revolution , seemingly dominated by firstborns .
After analyzing data on the period , `` I was desperate , '' he says .
`` I had to rethink .
'' The problem , he says , was a firstborn trait he had n't considered : tough-mindedness .
Eldest sons are used to asserting power over younger siblings , and they tend to be obdurate defenders of turf -- at least , more than younger siblings are , says Dr. Sulloway .
These tough ways come into play most strikingly when extended revolutions lead to terror .
After the French revolt was in full swing , eldest sons became revolutionists as often as younger ones .
But when the guillotine blades began to fall , later-borns balked while eldest sons headed the beheadings .
Maximilien Robespierre , one of the most bloodthirsty firstborns , even executed fellow revolutionary Georges Jacques Danton , a later-born , for his opposition to the killings .
`` The use of terror absolutely divides siblings '' along birth-order lines , adds Dr. Sulloway .
That made him confident that Carlos the Jackal , the Venezuelan terrorist , is a firstborn .
He is , in fact , the eldest offspring of Jose Altagracia Ramirez , a fanatical Marxist who taught his three sons to emulate his views , even naming them Ilich , Vladimir and Lenin after the parts of the Soviet leader 's name .
Ilich , alias Carlos , recently was arrested and boasts of killing 83 people .
His younger brothers , apparently revolting against their father 's extremism , have led quiet lives in business and engineering .
Dr. Sulloway hopes to publish his book soon , but recently has faced rejection from people in high places -- where , he notes , firstborns tend to preside .
Gleefully noting that anonymous grant reviewers termed his work `` silly '' and `` loopy , '' he adds , `` I 'd eat my grant proposal if there were n't some birth-order effect there .
'' MEXICO CITY -- As Mexican presidential election results increasingly pointed to a solid and relatively fair win by ruling-party candidate Ernesto Zedillo , the potential for unrest faded .
The possibility of problems diminished partly because it seemed more and more as if the margin of victory was much too great to be affected by the limited sorts of irregularities that watchdogs were reporting .
In addition , Dr. Zedillo did n't seem to be winning by too much .
With about a third of the votes counted , he seemed likely to win with less than 50 % of the vote , the first time in the ruling party 's 65 years in power that its candidate had n't won , or at least claimed , a majority .
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , the losing candidate considered most likely to call on his supporters to hold demonstrations , addressed a cheering crowd of 20,000 and urged them to push the Mexican government to clear up the irregularities in Sunday 's balloting .
But he stopped short of calling for widespread protests .
`` I ca n't claim triumph in this election , '' Mr. Cardenas said in one of the most forceful speeches the laconic candidate of the leftist PRD has given .
`` But no one can accept the results they are giving us .
'' His supporters chanted , `` Not one step back , '' `` Mobilization , '' and `` Death to the PRI , '' a reference to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party .
But Mr. Cardenas , the 60-year-old son of a revered ex-president , mainly seemed to be measuring the left 's strength , and he did n't find a lot .
The crowd was , for instance , far smaller than the angry crowd of 250,000 that gathered to protest what they saw as the fraudulent tactics used against Mr. Cardenas in the 1988 campaign , and even the crowd six years ago did n't resort to violence .
Yesterday 's crowd was also just perhaps one-seventh the size of the group that gathered in the same place a week and a half ago to mark the end of his campaign .
Mr. Cardenas managed to turn out thousands more in cities around the country , in what Mexicans had expected to be a high noon that could lead to demonstrations or even violence if Mr. Cardenas felt the elections were fraudulent .
But he ended the rallies simply with a call for another nationwide gathering Saturday .
At a news conference later , Mr. Cardenas said he felt there had been massive fraud in the elections .
He said he intended to have supporters spend the next week documenting the fraud and said he would try to pressure the government into concessions that would guarantee the legality of future votes .
He was n't more specific , but he emphasized that he intended to resolve the problems peacefully .
As election results came in yesterday , Mr. Cardenas 's chances of mounting a credible challenge diminished .
Roughly in line with nationwide exit polls , vote counts from about a third of the country gave Dr. Zedillo about 48 % ; Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , of the center-right PAN , about 30 % ; and Mr. Cardenas some 16 % .
Mr. Fernandez also undercut any claims of massive fraud by coming close to conceding the race and saying that the electoral process was `` a great triumph for all Mexico .
'' Likewise , unofficial reports that voter turnout was an extraordinary 75 % , compared with 48 % six years ago , lent credence to the results .
There were , however , some additional reports of fraud that came out yesterday .
Grassroots International , a U.S. group , said , for instance , that it had monitored 24 voting booths in the state of Oaxaca and had found widespread illegal monitoring and coaching of voters by ruling-party officials in the voting areas .
The Civic Alliance , the biggest Mexican watchdog group , said that in 9 % of the voting booths it monitored , observers found people who appeared to have voted twice .
The evidence was that the people 's fingers had already been marked with the indelible ink that was put on each voter 's right thumb when he or she voted .
Another 8 % of the booths had ink that could be washed off , creating opportunities for people to vote twice , the Civic Alliance said .
But even the Civic Alliance said it would n't be sure for another couple of days whether the problems affected a meaningful number of votes .
Other observer groups said they felt that the elections were generally clean .
The U.S. State Department , for instance , said that the Mexican elections `` appear to have been conducted in an orderly , peaceful fashion despite some irregularities .
'' Reflecting the calm that was settling in again in Mexico , the main stock market index here jumped 50.79 points , or 1.9 % , to 2758.97 .
The peso rose almost two centavos against the dollar , closing at 3.3375 pesos to the dollar , up from 3.3585 on Friday .
The bounce in the peso means it is now almost 3 % above the bottom of the official trading band .
That breathing room should allow the government to start lowering interest rates , which it had been keeping high to attract foreign money into peso-denominated securities and support the currency .
Any lowering of interest rates would be welcome here because rates , which are several times as high as in the U.S. in inflation-adjusted terms , have been strangling the economy .
The exit polls conducted following Sunday 's vote did confirm how disillusioned many Mexicans are and how much they want change .
A poll conducted by Mitofsky International , for instance , found that almost two-thirds of voters wanted significant changes in economic policy despite what has been described as the `` economic miracle '' of the current Salinas administration .
The poll also found that while 40 % felt they were better off than they were six years ago , 38 % felt they were in the same situation and 21 % were worse off .
As a result , not everyone , feels Mexico will settle down quickly .
At the Cardenas rally yesterday , Alejandro Encinas , a federal congressman from Mr. Cardenas 's party , said Dr. Zedillo needed to reach an agreement with opposition parties because of the irregularities .
He said Dr. Zedillo was especially vulnerable because of his apparent lack of a majority .
`` We will see a period of conflict for 100 days , '' Mr. Encinas predicted .
`` The vote has left the country divided .
'' WASHINGTON -- The compromise health plan put forth by Senate moderates came under withering attack from the left , while Republicans sought to use the pending crime bill to extricate themselves from the health-care reform debate .
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- held a flurry of meetings in an attempt to reach out to the bipartisan `` mainstream coalition '' and bridge differences within the Democratic Party .
The Democratic leadership is determined to keep the Senate in session to Labor Day if needed , but the hard reality is that no plan has enough support yet for passage .
The mainstream group , representing a swing bloc of perhaps 20 votes , is pivotal .
But most of its members are so fixed in their positions that it is difficult to find a combination of compromises that will keep the group intact and still move close enough to the Democrats so a bill can pass .
Sens. John Chafee -LRB- R. , R.I. -RRB- and John Breaux -LRB- D. , La. -RRB- , the two leaders of the mainstream group , met with Mr. Mitchell last night .
Although Democrats want to show some progress by the end of this week , Mr. Chafee said after the meeting that the path will be difficult .
`` The tough part is there are certain basic , core items that we feel are non-negotiable .
'' The moderates ' plan brought scalding attacks yesterday from some of the White House 's strongest allies in the health-care reform movement -- labor , the elderly and consumer groups .
The coalition 's package of insurance reforms and subsidies would leave 20 million people without health coverage at the turn of the century .
`` This is the ` Rosemary 's Baby ' of the health-care reform debate , '' said Ed Rothschild of Citizen Action , a consumer group .
`` It is something that has to be killed .
It is something concocted in part by the devil .
'' Many consumer groups have held their fire in recent months as the health-care reform debate steadily drifted to the right , away from timely universal coverage and from explicit controls on prices .
But the mainstream-coalition plan -- which drops a prescription-drug benefit for the elderly , scales back a proposed long-term-care program and devotes $ 100 billion to deficit reduction rather than expanded health coverage -- has gone too far for most of these groups .
Many say they are nearing the point that they 'd rather see no health-care legislation than a bill like the mainstream proposal .
`` It is becoming more and more difficult to imagine that something will be salvaged out of this debate , '' said Gail Shearer , manager of policy analysis at Consumers Union .
`` We fear the mainstream type proposals will make things worse for consumers in many ways .
'' Added John Rother , lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons : `` It 's getting closer and closer to the point where traditional advocates of reform are deciding it 's no longer worth the candle .
'' While closed-door negotiations continued into the evening yesterday , the Senate took a break from publicly debating health care in order to begin work on the crime bill , which passed the House Sunday night .
Republicans immediately sought to use the crime debate as a means to delay action on health care , suggesting that GOP senators would be willing to act more quickly on the crime legislation if they had a promise that the Senate could go home afterward for the rest of Congress 's summer recess .
All sides concede that the health-reform movement is in serious peril , but neither political party wants to seem so obstinate that it can be blamed for the collapse .
Republicans would prefer to extricate themselves on the grounds that time simply has run out and the issue is better taken up next year .
Democrats know they are too divided to pass a bill alone , but want to keep the focus on the GOP .
So prominent liberals such as Sens. John Rockefeller of West Virginia and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts played down their differences with the mainstream bill , and put the onus on the moderates to show some flexibility or be blamed for failure .
`` If they take a ` take-it-or-leave-it ' attitude , they 'll be responsible for the death of health care , '' said Mr. Rockefeller .
Sen. Chafee met yesterday with a predominantly liberal cast of Democrats committed to the goal of universal coverage .
Within this group , younger senators made no attempt to hide their disappointment with the limited scope of the moderates ' plan ; `` It 's a long way from what we campaigned on , '' said Sen. Russell Feingold -LRB- D. , Wis. -RRB- .
But lawmakers close to the leadership sought more often to emphasize common ground .
While the Rockefellers and Kennedys tend to get more attention , Sen. John Glenn -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- has emerged as a quiet stabilizing voice among the Democrats .
And Republican moderates credit Sen. Kent Conrad , a relatively junior Democrat from North Dakota , for playing an important role in holding the mainstream bloc together in developing its package .
Early in the day yesterday , Mr. Mitchell sought to smooth party rifts by bringing several Democratic members of the mainstream group together with leading proponents of universal coverage , like Mr. Rockefeller .
The scene , in a meeting room off the floor of the Senate , had a touch of the surreal .
As members gathered , a television screen showed a taped interview of Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan -LRB- D. , N.Y. -RRB- attacking elements of the plan only the day before .
Minutes later , the chairman arrived in the flesh and shirtsleeves .
`` Everybody 's going after it , '' said Sen. Harry Reid -LRB- D. , Nev. -RRB- .
`` Maybe that 's one of its good points .
'' Any effort to strike a compromise with the moderates is complicated by their commitment to reduce the deficit by as much as $ 100 billion over the next 10 years .
By comparison , both the Senate Finance Committee health bill reported last month and Mr. Mitchell 's more recent plan would reduce the deficit by about $ 13 billion to $ 14 billion over the same period despite higher taxes than the mainstream coalition has been willing to accept .
Opponents of the mainstream proposal are planning a daily drumbeat of events this week to attack elements of the proposal .
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland is slated to hold a news conference today ; elderly and disabled groups will speak out tomorrow , and health-care providers and consumers are likely to hold a forum Thursday .
MEXICO CITY -- When Mexico 's likely presidential winner , Ernesto Zedillo , is asked to summarize his economic program , he says : Macroeconomic reform has been accomplished , so now is the time to turn to the microeconomy .
Like the serious Dr. Zedillo , who apparently easily won Sunday 's elections , that sentence is n't the sort of rallying cry that people will take up in the streets .
But it does neatly forecast the attention that he and the team of young technocrats he has assembled will pay to such issues as on-the-job training and education .
Not that he and his team will stray far from the macroeconomic programs of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , with their emphasis on low inflation and balanced budgets .
Like Dr. Zedillo himself , many of his team were key players in the Salinas administration .
Dr. Zedillo likely will extend some of the Salinas macroeconomic reforms , selling off the state-run port system , railroads and anything else that was n't sold under the $ 22 billion Salinas privatization program .
Dr. Zedillo is expected to even open to foreign investment Petroleos Mexicanos , the state-owned oil company , which has been protected for political reasons but is so inefficient that its high prices are a drag on the whole economy .
But , based on those who seem to be his inner circle , he is likely to emphasize growth , even if it means slowing the attack on inflation .
Dr. Zedillo has said he wants to return the Mexican economy to what he sees as its historic growth rate of about 6 % , compared with 0.5 % last year and perhaps 2.5 % this year .
His team seems to feel that only robust , long-term economic growth can attack such microeconomic problems as low wages .
And while wages , adjusted for inflation , rose more than 30 % in the Salinas years , they are still below where they were in the early 1980s .
Dr. Zedillo 's story is reasonably well-known by now : Son of an electrician and a nurse , he grew up poor but , through overwhelming intelligence , won a series of scholarships that culminated in a Ph.D. in economics from Yale .
Dr. Zedillo , now 42 years old , then went to the central bank , where he engineered what has been widely described as a brilliant program to let Mexican companies deal with their dollar-denominated debt during the economic crisis of the early 1980s .
Later he served as secretary of budget and planning , then the secretary of education , then campaign manager for his friend Luis Donaldo Colosio , the ruling party 's initial candidate for president .
When Mr. Colosio was assassinated in March , Dr. Zedillo was named to replace him .
Those Dr. Zedillo has gathered around him are almost all young technocrats with advanced degrees in economics from major U.S. universities .
There are also some of the so-called dinosaurs , who retain considerable influence in the ruling party and did so much to turn out the vote for Dr. Zedillo .
Here are profiles of some of Dr. Zedillo 's closest advisers : Pedro Aspe , 44 , is Mexico 's finance minister and chief architect of the past seven years of economic reform .
He is considered one of the best finance ministers in Latin America .
During his tenure , annual inflation fell to about 6 % currently from about 160 % .
He privatized $ 22 billion of state-owned companies , renegotiated Mexico 's foreign debt at favorable terms and freed up billions of dollars for government social programs .
Entertaining , yet a man who abides by his convictions fearlessly , he has put rich tax cheats in jail and cleaned up Mexico 's corrupt customs service .
Dr. Aspe , who has a doctorate in economics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology , has said he would like to leave public service and spend more time with his family .
But many think he is one of the few people with enough guts and vision to modernize Pemex , or to tackle almost any other tough project .
Jaime Serra Puche , 43 , commerce secretary , was chiefly responsible for handling Mexico 's side of the negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. and Canada .
During the dark days of 1968 , Dr. Serra was a protester .
When he went to Yale to get his Ph.D. in economics , he overlapped for three years with Dr. Zedillo , and they became good friends .
As commerce secretary , he concentrated his efforts on Nafta and sometimes was faulted for not doing enough to help Mexican companies deal with such problems as high interest rates .
But Dr. Serra 's work on Nafta still seems to have him in line for either the finance ministry or Sedesol , which administers the huge Solidarity antipoverty program and which would round out his technocratic background by giving him more political experience .
Carlos Hank Gonzalez , 66 , the agriculture minister , is best-known for his leadership in the old guard of the ruling party .
After a campaign scandal here , known as `` Hankgate '' in which he used an office fax to send hundreds of letters promoting Dr. Zedillo , Mr. Hank promised he would retire from politics .
Some doubt that he will , and , in either case , his influence over the old wing of the PRI may prove useful to Dr. Zedillo as he tries to manage the country -- and his party .
Born into a family of humble means in a small town near Mexico City , Mr. Hank has built up an empire of businesses even though he began as a schoolteacher and has spent most of his career in public office .
Guillermo Ortiz , 46 , is subsecretary of finance and another old friend of Dr. Zedillo .
Dr. Ortiz was the hands-on technocrat who handled much of the day-to-day work of financial reform .
He oversaw Mexico 's $ 12 billion bank privatization program .
He was also a crucial player in lining up international support for the peso after the assassination of Mr. Colosio .
Dr. Ortiz , who obtained his doctorate in economics from Stanford University , is mentioned as another candidate for finance minister .
If he gets the job , he is likely to push for a more competitive banking system , look for ways to draw in substantial direct foreign investment and press for the privatization of state services , such as electric power , railroads , airports and ports .
Jose Angel Gurria , 44 , is Mexico 's Mr. Fix-It .
As chief foreign debt negotiator during the 1980s , Mr. Gurria , known as Angel , earned a nickname : In a spoof on this city 's famous Angel of Independence monument , he became known as the `` Angel of Dependence .
'' Mr. Gurria has also run Mexico 's export bank and the state development bank .
Most recently , he has been in charge of international relations for the ruling party and Dr. Zedillo .
In any bar in London , Paris , Frankfurt , Tokyo or New York where bankers or bond traders congregate , the Angel would recognize 20 friends and speak to them in their own language .
For this reason , Mr. Gurria , who has a master 's degree in international relations from the University of Southern California , is thought to be the choice to lead Mexico 's foreign ministry .
Cranky customers in cyberspace may hate advertising , but they better get used to it .
Commercial on-line services are increasingly sneaking ads into their products .
America Online , the service that just last year bragged `` no annoying advertising , '' is now exploring all kinds of ad possibilities .
Ads will proliferate on eWorld , the new Apple Computer service , as well as on the new Ziff service Interchange and CompuServe .
Rupert Murdoch 's Delphi outpost and a widely anticipated and as yet unnamed service from Microsoft will also run ads .
When users want to read daily news from Time magazine on America Online , they have to click past a window that shyly notes , `` Sponsored by Compaq .
'' And when an ad for Dreyfus shows up on a Prodigy `` Money Talk '' bulletin board , approximately 30,000 users see it , and 3,000 order brochures .
Ads appear in all shapes and sizes , depending on the service .
Some take the shape of product descriptions in electronic malls , giving users a chance to view a photo of the product .
Others appear as subtle blurbs in the corner of a window , while still others flash constantly on the bottom of the computer screen .
To sidestep user resistance , sponsors and on-line networks often deliver advertising along with with heavy doses of information or masquerading as sponsorships , contest promotions or interactive displays .
Alternatively , advertisers can beg for attention .
Ads being contemplated by Delphi Internet Services Corp. , recently acquired by News Corp. , might pay users cash rebates to endure product plugs .
`` The win for us and our media partners is if our subscribers did n't even think of it as advertising , '' says Stephen Case , president of America Online , Vienna , Va. .
Advertisers like the on-line demographics .
The services ' subscriber base is expected to grow 40 % to 4.2 million users by year end and to 13 million by 1998 , according to Link Resources .
On-line users typically earn more than $ 50,000 a year and are well-educated ; 80 % are male .
And on-line services can see their subscribers ' every move once they 've logged on and can feed that information to advertisers .
Most forecasts say ad sales could grow from nil to 30 % of on-line revenues in five years .
That distresses legions of on-line subscribers , who feel the monthly fees they pay should free them from ad clutter .
The barrage of ads also rankles privacy advocates .
On-line access is supposed `` to give you a window out into the world -- not give others a way to look into your home , '' says Marc Rotenberg , director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center , a public-interest group .
Two-thirds of users do n't want unsolicited ads , and almost half would n't be swayed even by paid incentives , says a survey by the Interactive Facts newsletter .
Undaunted , the broadcaster NBC , together with its major advertiser McDonald 's , pushes fast food on America Online .
Users can download a coloring book and bone up on a little McHistory : Did you know the Filet-o-Fish was spawned in 1964 ?
New America Online software soon will allow Time magazine to track how many of its on-line readers tap into a Merrill Lynch ad seeking retirement-planning advice .
CompuServe Information Services , owned by H&R Block , offers CD-ROMs to users , which are , essentially , guides that allow people to use CompuServe more cheaply and efficiently ; they also contain advertisements .
On the first disk that went out this summer : mail-order electronics , Kodak photo-CD software , a trailer for the `` City Slickers '' sequel and music videos by Jimmy Buffett .
A plug on the CD-ROM costs advertisers about $ 15,000 .
The early results of the CD-ROM are inauspicious .
About 60,000 people played the first disk , but only about 100 ordered music CDs .
Even fewer bought Walkmans and other gear , logging $ 22,000 in orders with direct marketer CUC International Inc. `` We thought it was an interesting and encouraging first cut , '' says Edward Sanden , a CUC vice president .
Advertisers have a less expensive option with CompuServe .
Ads on the service 's `` electronic mall , '' an on-line catalog , cost $ 20,000 per year plus 2 % of any resulting sales .
The CD-ROM effort and the on-line mall let CompuServe avoid what on-line customers really hate : `` highly intrusive advertising , '' says Barry Berkov , executive vice president at CompuServe .
But rival Michael Kolowich , president of Ziff Communications ' Interchange , says that by relegating advertising to a small corner of the on-line service , you `` ghettoize '' it .
Interchange , which will start up late this year , prefers a proud-to-pitch approach .
`` We wo n't be apologetic about advertising , '' vows Mr. Kolowich .
Electronic banners will beckon users to call up full-screen ads .
Prodigy , a joint venture of International Business Machines and Sears Roebuck , caters advertising to users ' expressed interests .
Fidelity Investments , for example , offers investment tips to users who cruise the financial bulletin boards .
`` If you 're in the financial area , we should n't be bombarding you with toothpaste ads , '' says Ross Glatzer , Prodigy 's president .
Financial-services firms typically pay Prodigy $ 27,000 a month for five linked `` electronic pages '' of exposure .
While it is difficult to compare the cost with other media , Mr. Glatzer says an on-line ad costs perhaps $ 34 to reach 1,000 households .
It costs only about $ 10 , by comparison , to reach 1,000 homes with a prime-time TV ad .
But narrowing the target to reach the same high-income sliver of viewers would cost upward of $ 40 , says Roland Sharette , director of interactive resources at ad agency J. Walter Thompson , a unit of WPP Group .
He says he ran one recent ad campaign in which on-line exposure amounted to only one-tenth of the budget but generated more than 20 % of customers ' responses .
Madison Avenue could learn a lot from on-line advertising , where clients would get detailed information about which ads flop and a direct line into customers ' likes and dislikes .
But `` there 's a high level of concern , '' too , says Mr. Sharette of J. Walter Thompson .
Direct customer response `` has always been a blessing and a horrible experience , '' he says , `` because everything is laid bare .
'' Seagram Co. yesterday eliminated Grey Advertising as a finalist for its Chivas Regal scotch account .
That leaves TBWA Advertising as the only agency in the review , which until recently also included WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather .
However , Seagram stopped short of officially naming TBWA as its agency .
Indeed , a Seagram official said : `` We have n't appointed an agency .
We have eliminated Grey .
'' The official added that Seagram is n't speaking to other agencies .
-LRB- The incumbent agency is Omnicom Group 's DDB Needham .
-RRB- Billings were n't disclosed , but officials said they are `` in excess of $ 10 million .
'' Grey and TBWA made presentations yesterday to Seagram executives , including the president and chief executive officer , Edgar Bronfman .
It could be assumed that Seagram and TBWA have n't come to compensation terms on the new world-wide campaign .
An announcement is expected sometime next month .
The most recent campaign for the venerable brand is `` There will also be a Chivas Regal .
'' The brand went from campaign to campaign without the success of a campaign it ended in 1988 after a quartercentury .
That campaign used humor to position Chivas as a tony brand .
But the ads made Chivas seem that it was only appropriate for special occasions .
So , ads introduced six years ago included the slogan , `` What are you saving the Chivas for ?
'' Ciba-Geigy Corp. 's Ciba Seeds unit said it filed for regulatory approvals to market a genetically engineered corn seed that resists insect pests .
Ciba Seeds , based in Greensboro , N.C. , said it filed applications with the Environmental Protection Agency , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
A company spokesman said the first major hurdle is the EPA approval , which is required because of the insecticide properties of the corn .
The spokesman said EPA approval is expected within a year , and that the company expects to market the corn seed in 1996 at the earliest .
The Ciba corn produces a protein derived from the naturally occurring soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis , or Bt .
Corn plants producing the Bt protein are protected from such insect pests as the European corn borer .
Ciba-Geigy is a Swiss chemicals and pharmaceuticals concern .
Big investors and retirement-plan sponsors said they are forming a committee to deal with the U.S. fallout from the collapse of Canadian-based Confederation Life Insurance Co. .
At stake is the performance of about $ 2 billion in guaranteed investment contracts issued by Confederation in the U.S. .
Many employees choose GICs as an option for retirement investing .
A GIC is a bond-like instrument issued by life-insurance companies , with the insurer `` guaranteeing '' principal and interest payments .
But that guarantee is n't backed by any federal insurance .
Confederation has suspended making principal and interest payments on its GICs .
Many corporate employees indirectly own GICs .
The investment contracts are the principal holdings of `` fixed '' or `` stable value '' accounts in 401 -LRB- k -RRB- savings plans and profit-sharing plans .
A spokesman for Confederation said it is `` impossible to even guess '' what the eventual impact on its GICs will be .
Confederation Life was seized by Canadian insurance regulators earlier this month and is being liquidated .
Its U.S. operations , with assets of some $ 7.3 billion , were taken over by regulators in Michigan and Georgia , who are attempting to rehabilitate the business .
Confederation 's GICs represent only about 1 % of the total GICs outstanding in the U.S. .
In most cases , retirement-plan providers said , Confederation GICs probably make up a small part of any particular plan 's overall GIC portfolio .
But a few unlucky retirement plans with a heavy concentration of Confederation GICs may face lower interest rates than they expected , or delays in getting access to their money .
In the worst case , they could also suffer losses on some of the money they have invested in Confederation GICs .
Confederation 's woes are `` unlikely to have an impact '' on most GIC investors in retirment plans , said Victor Gallo , an executive vice president at Primco Capital Management , a Louisville , Ky. , manager of GICs and similar investments .
Mr. Gallo has been part of the effort to form a committee and more than 40 institutional investors and retirement-plan sponsors have expressed interest , he said .
Investors are `` highly likely to get money back '' from Confederation , said David Schupp , of the Hartford , Conn. , insurance research firm Townsend & Schupp .
`` The question is , how much money and when .
'' PaineWebber Group said the Confederation troubles will have an `` insignificant impact on annual yield '' of the GIC portfolios managed by PaineWebber , and `` no impact '' on their principal value .
PaineWebber says Confederation GICs make up about 2 % of its clients ' GIC holdings .
However , employees of some plans with a large investment in Confederation GICs might find that they ca n't redeem that portion of their GIC investments until a plan is worked out for paying off Confederation 's GICs .
It `` seems to be likely '' that investors ' principal will be covered , Mr. Gallo said .
Other observers said they do n't know what the final result will be .
Investors in GICs issued by Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co. , seized by regulators several years ago , received lower interest rates , or longer maturies , than they expected .
But they received 100 cents on each dollar invested .
However , most investors in GICs from Executive Life Insurance Co. , also seized by regulators , can expect at most 84 cents on the dollar , according to Townsend & Schupp .
Industry people said that among the retirement-plan managers that have bought Confederation GICs for their clients are Fidelity Investments , T. Rowe Price Associates , Bankers Trust , Merrill Lynch & Co. and State Street Bank & Trust Co. .
Hewitt Associates and Vanguard Group said their retirement-fund clients have only a small investment in Confederation GICs .
Primco has clients invested in these GICs , though none have major positions , Mr. Gallo said .
Vanguard said it 's suggesting two possible paths to its retirement-plan sponsors .
In the first , some plans are allowing their investors to withdraw money from GIC plans that hold Confederation GICs and to get 100 cents on the dollar , either because the holdings are so small or because their retirement-plan sponsors are making up the difference in anticipation of future payments from Confederation .
In the second , other corporate plan sponsors are barring withdrawals from whatever part of the portfolio is represented by Confederation GICs until a plan is worked out to pay them off .
It used to be said that whenever the U.S. faced a foreign crisis , the president 's first words were , `` Where are the carriers ?
'' For a Third World country faced with those carriers , a natural cry is `` Where is our submarine ?
'' Quiet and hard to detect , the submarine is one of very few possible equalizers a relatively poor country can use to oppose overwhelming naval power .
Many nations , some of them quite hostile to the U.S. , already have submarines .
The examples include Cuba , Algeria , Libya , Syria , Iran and North Korea .
Many of these submarines are aging , but in the post-Cold War world they do present a threat to Western naval intervention .
Consider the Adriatic , where Western carriers enforce a blockade of Serbia : Should Serbia decide to resist the blockade , probably its most effective counterforce would be its small submarines .
A single Serbian submarine might not have a good chance of sinking a Western carrier .
But the sub raises the risk of the operation .
Blockades are politically acceptable because they cost very little .
Raising their cost with a submarine-based threat to the surface ships would make politicians think twice about blockading .
The germane difference in the post-Cold War world is that the level of acceptable cost involved in naval warfare has come down dramatically .
In a fight to the death against the Soviets , Western navies would have hunted down and sunk submarines anywhere in the world .
Such a strategy might have resulted in mistaken attacks against friendly or neutral submarines , but that was considered an acceptable cost .
Now that the Soviets are gone , such a high cost is considered unacceptable .
An accidental attack on a friendly or neutral sub would be a huge political embarrassment .
Therefore , navies are n't as likely to hunt out potential submarine threats .
Big-power navies may well find themselves limited mostly to counterattacks on submarines actually attacking their ships .
Similarly , in a major war -LRB- like the one envisioned during the Cold War -RRB- , losing many warships was seen as a perfectly acceptable cost of victory .
However , in a very limited regional war -LRB- of the sort envisioned in the post-Cold War world -RRB- , submarine-inflicted damage to even one of its ships might well cause a big-power government to think twice about further intervention .
Small nations interested in beefing up their submarine capabilities have three choices : hoping that their existing craft suffice to deter superpower navies ; upgrading existing submarines with better weapons ; or buying new ones .
Submarine builders hope that they can offer sufficient improvements to justify the high cost of new submarines .
The main such improvement , offered by several builders , is a secondary form of submarine power plant called an air-independent propulsion -LRB- AIP -RRB- .
The Swedish Stirling engine , the German fuel cell and the German closed-cycle diesel are three examples .
This quiet and long-lasting propulsion system allows a submarine to loiter on patrol for days or weeks without having to recharge its battery -- a process that involves risking detection because a loud diesel engine is used for the recharging .
At a stroke , the AIP system dates the developing world 's recharge-needy submarines , and the Swedish and German builders hope these countries will want to update their fleets .
For those unwilling to purchase the new propulsion system , simpler and cheaper modernization is available thanks to underwater-to-surface antiship missiles .
A submarine exposes its position and invites pursuit when it fires .
It can lessen its risk of detection by extending the range of its fire .
At last year 's Moscow Air Show , the Russians suggested that they would soon be selling antiship missiles that Western-built submarines might fire from below the water 's surface .
During the Cold War , the Soviets also developed torpedoes that could detect and follow a ship 's wake .
They had a very long range , and it was virtually impossible to counter them .
The only consolation was that they surely would not sell anything so effective to third parties .
Now the cash-hungry Russians have put a variety of torpedoes up for sale -- all of them wake-followers .
The Russians are not alone .
Some years ago , the Germans developed a sensor for wake-following , but never put it in a torpedo until earlier this year , when a French torpedo maker announced the standard French antiship torpedo could use the German sensor .
German-made torpedoes will likely follow suit .
German submarines sold in the 1970s and 1980s will be able to accommodate such weapons , thus the wake-followers are likely to be popular .
The question remains whether a submarine threat to big-power navies will be realized .
Iran has bought Russian submarines as a way of keeping the U.S. Navy out of the Persian Gulf , and North Korea has reportedly purchased used submarines from Russia .
But so far there has been relatively little activity in the new-sub market .
This is partly because submarines , while prestigious , are expensive both to buy and to operate .
Most buyers are aware that the potency of a submarine depends as much on the training and motivation of the men operating it as on the machine itself .
But the technology and skill required to use a submarine effectively are not readily available in most developing countries .
Some buyers seem to have concluded that merely listing their boats in the pages of the standard naval reference works buys them much of the deterrence they seek .
For example , in 1986 the U.S. attacked Libya , which had six Soviet-supplied submarines .
Although U.S. intelligence had good reason to believe that these submarines were unusable , the carrier force could not afford to disregard them .
In the submarine world , `` good reason '' is never certainty .
Although a developing-country submarine threat has yet to materialize , big-power navies should take precautions now , with better intelligence-gathering and preservation of their own maritime strength .
Today 's trophy submarine in a developing-country harbor can quickly become tomorrow 's effective threat if its officers and crew receive the right training and it is updated with the right weapons .

The Berkeley Three are free .
Joseph Deringer , Alexandra White and Richard Graham went up against the modern police state and won .
The Department of Housing and Urban Development last week dropped a seven-month investigation against the trio , who had fallen under the evil eye of HUD after voicing opposition to a housing project for the homeless that is planned near their homes .
The HUD vigilantes launched their investigation under the terms of the Fair Housing Act , which protects the housing rights of , among others , the mentally ill and people with drug or alcohol problems .
Many of the homeless fall into either or both categories , and according to the imaginative definition of the HUD thought police , opposition to housing proposals based on such attributes as mental illness or substance abuse constitutes harassment and is not protected by the First Amendment .
The Berkeley Three have gotten a lot of publicity , including a feature on this page by Heather Mac Donald on August 8 , and senior HUD officials have been working overtime talking out of both sides of their mouths trying to explain their investigation .
On one hand , they rush to assure critics that they would n't dream of doing anything that might chill free speech .
On the other hand , they piously claim it is their duty to investigate any complaint .
This was the tack taken by Roberta Achtenberg , assistant secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity , in announcing the Berkeley Three decision and in an Op-Ed article yesterday in the Washington Post .
But the champion doubletalker is her boss , HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros , who took the unusual step of issuing a statement on August 11 on the Berkeley Three .
Mr. Cisneros forcefully set down the perils of the HUD policy : `` It would be dangerous if government agencies were to exercise the power to judge or to censor what people may say in pursuit of their political objectives .
It is in direct contradiction of a constitutional principle for large and remote bureaucracies with their intimidating legal and police powers to assume a role as judges or guardians of thought , public expression , or political discourse .
'' Fine , but how did the Berkeley Three ever get charged in the first place ?
For saying what they thought , they faced fines of up to $ 100,000 and a year in jail .
How much easier it would have been simply to keep quiet .
Mr. Cisneros is unwilling to recognize the reality of enforcing a law that tells him to go out and silence people , and along the way possibly impoverish them as they fork over huge penalties and legal fees ; if he means what he says , he should urge that the provisions be repealed .
The plight of the Berkeley Three also raises the troubling issue of the growing police powers of agencies whose traditional duties do not include law enforcement .
HUD `` fair housing '' lawyers who troll the classified ads searching for malefactors such as the Wisconsin woman who advertised last year for a `` Christian handyman '' as a tenant for an apartment in her home .
Or the EPA posses on the hunt for despoilers of `` wetlands .
'' Or the New Jersey man who this month faced two summonses from the Humane Society for killing a rat .
Do we really want to hand over to such agencies the power to ruin lives ?
The Berkeley Three are not an isolated example of HUD 's overreach .
Across the country , HUD 's thought police have silenced critics with fines and threats .
Like dissidents who got their names in the papers in the days of the Soviet Union , the Berkeley Three were protected by the publicity their case generated ; it was easier for HUD to drop their case than face the public outcry .
Other HUD targets may not be so lucky .
WAYNE , Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. will add a third production crew at its truck plant here , increasing the plant 's full-time work force by 900 and boosting its annual production capacity by 15 % .
The decision , which had been expected , gives Ford additional flexibility to meet strong truck demand in the U.S. Even if demand were to soften -- a real possibility because of recent interest-rate increases -- Ford said the added production at Michigan Truck could be used for exports .
Ford said it is spending $ 10.7 million to add the third crew , plus an additional $ 15 million for training facilities .
The plant , which opened in 1964 , produces Ford 's full-sized F Series pickups , its full-sized Bronco sport-utility vehicles and its full-sized F-150 Lightning specialty pickups .
Last year , the plant produced 132,378 vehicles .
The third crew boosts the plant 's total annual capacity to 240,000 vehicles from 208,000 vehicles .
Most of the new jobs will be hourly positions , some of which will be filled by part-timers who already work at the plant .
The plant currently employs 1,900 hourly workers .
Bob Transou , Ford 's group vice president for automotive manufacturing , said successful implementation of the third crew could lead to the addition of third crews at other Ford plants .
However , he said the decision to add extra crews elsewhere probably would n't be made before the end of next year .
Separately , Ford said it is establishing a $ 40 million technology and development laboratory in Yokohama City , Japan , that will be used to market the auto maker 's vehicle components to Japanese customers .
The facility will begin operating in 1996 .
Ford said it will employ 40 people initially , but its staff could double by the year 2000 .
NEW YORK -- Lucie Salhany , the television-industry veteran who recently quit at Fox Broadcasting Co. , has emerged as a top contender among four candidates to head the upcoming United\/Paramount Network , according to people familiar with the situation .
The so-called fifth network , which is set for launch in January , is a joint venture between Chris-Craft Industries Inc. 's United Television and Viacom Inc. 's Paramount Communications Inc. .
Ms. Salhany `` is very much near the top of the list '' of candidates , which also includes Paramount insiders , said one senior company insider .
This person and others familiar with the situation declined to identify other candidates .
Ms. Salhany 's discussions concerning the job were first reported by the Los Angeles Times .
The television-industry executive could n't be reached to comment .
Viacom officials declined to comment , and Chris-Craft executives were n't available .
If selected , Ms. Salhany would return to Paramount , where she presided over the studio 's highly successful and profitable television-syndication division .
She quit the studio in 1991 to join Fox .
Last month , however , she resigned from Fox after differences with her boss , Rupert Murdoch .
Separately , WKBD-TV in Detroit said yesterday that it will become an affiliate of United\/Paramount Network in January .
Until the announcement , the station had been the subject of intense speculation about its future ownership and affiliation plans .
Currently , the station , which is owned by Viacom 's Paramount , is a Fox affiliate .
Last week , Neutrogena Corp. was nothing more than a company with a funny name that peddled see-through soap .
Yesterday , it became a sensation on Wall Street , the latest beneficiary of what is being called the `` blowout bid .
'' Johnson & Johnson 's agreement to buy Neutrogena at $ 35.25 a share is 70 % higher than Neutrogena 's price only two weeks ago and a 23 % premium over its closing stock price on Friday .
Why would any rational company pay such a huge premium ?
The simple answer : That 's what it takes to get the job done .
By offering a high price -- one equal to nearly 29 times expected 1995 profits and 2.7 times expected sales -- Johnson & Johnson minimizes the chances of getting topped by a rival bidder .
Assuming the $ 924.1 million transaction makes good business sense , the `` blowout bid '' gives Johnson & Johnson -- not to mention Neutrogena -- everything it wants without the uncertainty of a prolonged auction .
`` It 's a very smart tactic , '' says Bernie Jacob , senior vice president of global mergers and acquisitions at Chase Manhattan .
`` If you really want the target , you go after it .
'' While buyers and sellers both may love the idea of blowout bids , not everyone shares that enthusiasm .
Arbitragers and other investors who buy takeover targets after a transaction is announced , for example , can find themselves frozen out of what could , under other circumstances , be lucrative deals .
A case in point : last year 's monumental battle for Paramount Communications Inc. .
Investors who bought Paramount stock immediately after Viacom Inc. 's initial bid paid $ 64.50 a share .
Then QVC Inc. made a rival bid , and Paramount stock went even higher .
Before the dust settled , investors saw their stock peak at $ 83 .
That represented a 29 % return in just two months , or an annualized return of 174 % .
But because J&J is willing to pay such a steep premium , investors who bought Neutrogena after the announcement might not be so lucky .
On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday , Neutrogena closed at $ 34.766 , a mere 48 cents shy of the agreed price .
If the transaction closes in a month , that 48-cent-a-share gain would represent an annualized return of 14 % .
If it takes two months , the return falls to 7 % .
That 's not much of a benefit considering the risk that , because of unforeseen circumstances , the acquisition falls through and the share price plummets back to near its original pretransaction level .
At least in Neutrogena 's case , investors had an inkling that something might be coming .
Two weeks ago , the company disclosed it was talking `` with a substantially larger company '' about a takeover .
But , more often than not , blowout bids strike out of the blue .
Two of this year 's biggest transactions , Sandoz AG 's $ 53 bid for Gerber Products Co. and Roche Holding AG 's $ 24 bid for Syntex Corp. , came without hints .
And both offers are so rich that they leave little room for a decent arbitrage return .
Sandoz paid a surprising 27 times expected 1995 earnings for Gerber .
Roche paid 24 times expected earnings .
American Cyanamid Co. presented a slightly different situation .
American Home Products Corp. intially offered an unsolicited $ 95 a share for Cyanamid .
In such cases , the target will often try to find a white knight , or a friendly bidder .
But because American Home 's offer was so high , it scared off other bidders and managed to persuade Cyanamid into a friendly takeover at $ 101 a share .
The rise of blowout bids marks one more difference between this year 's merger mania and the takeover frenzy of the 1980s .
In the 1980s , corporate raiders bought companies in search of a quick buck .
They would buy with borrowed money and sell off the assets to reduce the debt .
The less they paid for acquisitions , the bigger the potential return .
The current crop of corporate buyers can afford to pay more .
Not only can a buyer slash overhead by cutting redundant functions , but it can build the franchise .
Johnson & Johnson can lend its marketing clout to Neutrogena and , it hopes , make Neutrogena 's products more profitable than if Neutrogena stood alone .
Corporate buyers also may have a better sense of the target 's true worth than a leveraged-buyout firm .
`` Corporate buyers are much more knowledgeable about what has to be paid because they are in the market all the time , '' says Peter Schoenfeld , vice chairman of Wertheim Schroder & Co. .
Another , albeit lesser , factor contributing to the high bids are recent court actions .
In its ruling earlier this year in Paramount 's lawsuit against QVC , the Delaware Supreme Court put more pressure on companies to canvas the market before announcing a transaction .
So it 's not surprising that companies are nowadays conducting silent auctions .
`` The board of directors knows it has to get more than just a price in the range of fairness , '' says Meredith Brown , a takeover lawyer at New York law firm Debevoise & Plimpton .
`` They have to get the best price .
'' LOS ANGELES -- Casual Dining Concepts Inc. will pay $ 55 million to buy stock and notes of Koo Koo Roo Inc. , giving the private investment company a stake of as much as 51 % in Koo Koo Roo , a restaurant chain .
Under the preliminary agreement , Los Angeles-based Casual Dining will buy $ 45 million of Koo Koo Roo senior secured notes , $ 5 million of common stock , and $ 5 million of preferred stock .
Some of the preferred stock has a conversion feature , which along with warrants issued as part of the transaction , would allow Casual Dining to raise its ownership stake in Koo Koo Roo to 51 % when all elements of the proposal are completed .
Terms of the preliminary pact call for a final agreement to be signed within 60 days .
Koo Koo Roo said the $ 55 million will be used to open restaurants nationwide .
The accord also calls for a voting trust under which Kenneth Berg , Koo Koo Roo 's chairman , agrees to vote his shares with those of Casual Dining for a designated slate of directors .
Currently , the chain owns 10 restaurants in California , Florida and New Jersey .
Koo Koo Roo serves flame-broiled , skinless chicken using a proprietary recipe ; fresh roasted , hand-carved turkey ; rotisserie chicken , fresh vegetables , rice , wheats and grains .
The company , which prior to the transaction had 8.2 million shares outstanding , or 11.2 million on a fully diluted basis , had revenue of $ 1.4 million in its fiscal third quarter ended March 29 , and a loss of $ 804,784 , or 12 cents a share .
On news of the proposed transaction , shares of Los Angeles-based Koo Koo Roo fell 43.8 cents to $ 8.69 cents , or 4.8 % , in Nasdaq Stock Market trading .
Volume of 731,600 shares was more than seven times the stock 's daily average volume .
NEW YORK -- AT&T Corp. and Intel Corp. , bridging high-tech 's biggest chasm in desktop video communications , agreed to develop software methods for letting all kinds of video-equipped personal computers talk via AT&T 's global network .
AT&T and Intel continue to back competing software schemes for letting people communicate using personal computers equipped with video cameras .
But the world 's biggest communication services company and largest chip maker sought common ground so that their differences would n't stall videoconferencing 's next gold rush : the desktop .
`` This is a great deal for the industry , '' said Elliot Gold , president of TeleSpan Publishing Corp. , Altadena , Calif. , which follows the videoconferencing market .
`` Now people who buy equipment using either standard will know their machines will communicate .
'' AT&T , in a bid to boost traffic over its network , has been pushing a new network service called WorldWorx .
The offering promotes video and data collaboration between PC users through long-distance communications lines .
As part of this effort , AT&T is programming the computer servers in its network to recognize and pass traffic from video-equipped PCs that adhere to an international software standard called H. 320 .
Many of the world 's biggest computer and communications companies back this method and have joined AT&T 's camp , including International Business Machines Corp. , Apple Computer Inc. , Xerox Corp. , PictureTel Corp. , and Sun Microsystems Inc. .
International communications carriers also support H. 320 .
Not Intel .
It is pushing a method called Personal Conferencing Specification and a software product , ProShare , that uses such a design .
While Intel is virtually alone in backing its `` PCS '' proposal , it nonetheless has been a conspicuous loner in the desktop video race , since it equips more than 80 % of the world 's personal computers .
Another conspicuous holdout , particularly from the AT&T camp , has been Microsoft Corp. .
The world 's largest PC software supplier has yet to unveil its own videoconferencing product .
AT&T insiders said AT&T may try to use the Intel agreement to persuade Microsoft that the two companies can find common ground .
AT&T declined to comment .
Yesterday 's agreement concludes more than nine months of arduous negotiations between AT&T and Intel about how best to work together .
`` Now the consumer gets a choice of products , the videoconferencing industry grows and we get rich traffic volume on our network , '' said John Petrillo , president of AT&T Business Communication Services .
`` The logic of this relationship is extremely strong , '' said Andrew Grove , Intel 's chief executive .
`` We want to make ProShare pervasive , giving users access to other users and advanced services .
'' He said Intel will design bridging mechanisms into its software so that its customers can also use H.320-based equipment .
But some people at AT&T resisted the deal .
They pressed the company to bypass Intel entirely .
Their arguments raged as late as last week .
But Mr. Petrillo said AT&T 's determination to create a global network of video users and build its traffic won out .
`` There clearly was debate , but we 've made a choice to do both and develop transcoding to make it work .
'' Mr. Grove said the collaboration will take months of work between AT&T and Intel engineers .
So far , `` we 've developed a roadmap , '' he said .
Whether their roads connect will be displayed in December when AT&T and Intel will demonstrate their video collaboration in New York 's vast public library .
NEW YORK -- James J. Schiro , 48 years old , has been nominated for a five-year term as the next chairman and senior partner of Price Waterhouse , the sixth biggest U.S. accounting firm , starting July 1 , 1995 .
Mr. Schiro , vice chairman of Price 's metropolitan New York region since 1990 , would succeed Shaun F. O'Malley , who turns 60 next year , the firm 's mandatory age for retirement .
Mr. O'Malley has been the firm 's chief executive since 1988 .
The nomination of Mr. Schiro must be confirmed by Price 's 970 partners .
The vote has already begun and should be completed by mid-September , the firm said .
Mr. Schiro joined Price in 1967 and became a partner in 1979 .
Price , which has 106 offices and 13,000 employees in the U.S. , reported annual revenue of $ 1.57 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30 , up 10 % from a year earlier .
That compares with a 4 % year-to-year gain in fiscal 1993 .
Arthur Bowman , editor of Bowman 's Accounting Report , says that Mr. Schiro takes over Price when the firm is in a strong financial position and is growing stronger in information-technology consulting , a field dominated by Arthur Andersen , the biggest U.S. accounting firm and a consulting leader .
Mr. Schiro will assume leadership of the firm at a time when it has been hit with sizable lawsuits involving professional negligence , as have most other Big Six firms .
Earlier this month , Price converted itself into a limited-liability partnership , which protects the personal assets of partners that are n't involved in a lawsuit if the firm were to go bankrupt .
A Price spokesman said that Mr. Schiro is out of town and `` can not be reached '' for comment .
WASHINGTON -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Under pressure from Congress and the drug industry , the Clinton administration has abandoned plans for the government to distribute vaccines as part of its new program to immunize children free .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had planned to set up a federal warehouse to distribute vaccines at a cost of about $ 14 million as part of the Vaccines for Children program .
But Walter Orenstein , director of the CDC 's immunization program , said yesterday that controversy had killed plans for the federal warehouse planned for Burlington , N.J. Dr. Orenstein said the Vaccines for Children program still will start as scheduled on Oct. 1 because the states that wanted to get vaccines from the warehouse had promised CDC that they would continue providing vaccines to public clinics through the Medicaid program .
However , uninsured children who would have been able to get free vaccines from private doctors under the warehouse distribution plan will have to continue relying on public clinics or pay out of pocket for the time being .
The Vaccines for Children program is part of President Clinton 's $ 500 million child-immunization initiative , a plan to get almost every U.S. child immunized against nine major diseases through a mix of education , reminders and free vaccines .
WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans served notice they would not rubber-stamp the $ 30.2 billion crime bill , which got through the House only after difficult bipartisan negotiations .
While the Senate action is likely to be less tumultuous than the 11-day battle that engulfed the House and the White House after the bill was temporarily stalled , the Senate debate promises to be a heated one , as Republicans vowed to stop the bill with a parliamentary move .
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah , ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , urged rejection of the bill because he said it spends too much on crime prevention and too little on prisons .
`` The most effective crime-prevention program we can enact is one that provides for the swift apprehension of criminals , their speedy trial and their lengthy incarceration , '' Mr. Hatch said .
The legislation `` falls far short in this regard , '' he added .
Republicans say the trust fund that would finance the crime bill violates the 1974 budget law .
If their parliamentary move is successful , it would open up the measure to potentially hundreds of amendments and delay passage of anticrime legislation indefinitely .
Mr. Hatch said such a procedural move `` is not intended to kill a crime bill .
It is intended to provide the basis for making the bill tougher '' through additional negotiations .
`` There is plenty of time left in this session to produce a worthy crime bill , '' he said .
Democrats need 60 votes to block the GOP move , the same number needed to break a filibuster .
`` I think it will be close , '' Sen. Joseph Biden -LRB- D. , Del. -RRB- , chairman of the Judiciary Committee , said in an interview .
He said he knows of only a couple of GOP members currently willing to vote against the Republican move .
If that move is successful , the Senate will be in session a long time .
Mr. Biden told colleagues `` there is not a chance '' the Senate will recess without a crime bill .
`` We are not going home until we get a crime bill .
'' -- About $ 6 billion for crime-prevention programs , including drug treatment , economic development and a block grant which could fund such efforts as antigang projects and midnight basketball leagues for young people .
Additionally , the legislation would ban military-style assault weapons , expand the federal death penalty to cover more than 60 crimes and mandate life imprisonment for those convicted of three violent felonies .
Mr. Biden urged passage of the crime bill , saying : `` It literally is the difference between tens of thousands of people being safe and being in danger .
It literally saves lives .
'' Seagram Co. yesterday eliminated Grey Advertising as a finalist for its Chivas Regal scotch account .
That leaves TBWA Advertising as the only agency in the review , which until recently also included WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather .
However , Seagram stopped short of officially naming TBWA as its agency .
Indeed , a Seagram official said : `` We have n't appointed an agency .
We have eliminated Grey .
'' The official added that Seagram is n't speaking to other agencies .
-LRB- The incumbent agency is Omnicom Group 's DDB Needham .
-RRB- Billings were n't disclosed , but officials said they are `` in excess of $ 10 million .
'' Grey and TBWA made presentations yesterday to Seagram executives , including the president and chief executive officer , Edgar Bronfman .
It could be assumed that Seagram and TBWA have n't come to compensation terms on the new world-wide campaign .
An announcement is expected sometime next month .
The most recent campaign for the venerable brand is `` There will also be a Chivas Regal .
'' The brand went from campaign to campaign without the success of a campaign it ended in 1988 after a quarter-century .
That campaign used humor to position Chivas as a tony brand .
But the ads made Chivas seem that it was only appropriate for special occasions .
So , ads introduced six years ago included the slogan , `` What are you saving the Chivas for ?

As a copacetic earthbound-gardener , I 've never had much enthusiasm for things lunar : not moonshots , not moonwalks , not moon flag-plantings .
What dirt gardener could care about so unphotosynthetic and lifeless a place as the moon ?
Nevertheless , despite having an attitude toward the lunar landscape , even I got mildly caught up in celebrating the 25th anniversary of American moonwalking enough to decide to plant the ordinary gardener 's easy alternative to moonshots : MOONFLOWERS !
My own moon program took off by chance one impossibly humid night last summer .
Round midnight I leashed up my canine , Mojo , and wandered up the block .
Before too many paces the sullen Brooklyn night turned delicious , fragrant , tropical .
We were whiffing downwind of a startling terrestrial moonflorescence !
Some anonymous moonflower maven had draped an entire front fence in lunaflora .
Plenipotent urban aroma therapy !
Scores of the bright white moonblooms exuding lushlife fumes could not but rocket mere pedestrians over the moon .
Thereafter , I inhaled of the moonflower patch on the midnightly dogwalk .
As summer waned , I deadheaded and stockpiled moonflower seed , in planticipation of our man on the moon 's 25th anniversary .
My moon program , unlike NASA 's $ 100 billion Apollonian adventure , is dirt cheap and mostly dependent on such opportunistic scavenging , especially on being in the right `` situ '' at the right `` tempus '' to rescue that most abandoned of corporate trees in New York City : the braided `` Ficus benjamina .
'' Last year I made three streetside adoptions of dead but nonetheless upright Ficus benjaminas .
I had no desire to bring these casualties of corporate interior decor back to life : For this moonflower mission , the deader the ficus the better .
In May , I nicked , notched , filed , scarified and soaked the steel-hulled seeds of the moonflower and planted them around the trunk of a defunct ficus -LRB- moonflower scaffold pro tem -RRB- .
Come June , I had successfully reinvented one Ficus benjam-ina -- voila the moonflower tree !
By way of celebrating man 's first moon footfall , July 20 , I celebrated my first moonflowering , summer 1994 .
The moonflower tree lofted luminous ghostly vespertine blooms , evening-glories of such prodigious perfume -- as to totally eclipse memory of the whilom little-leaved corporate ficus .
My first encounter with these magical sublunar bindweeds dates from the early '80s , when I ordered seed of the ` GIANT MOONFLOWER ' from the inscrutable J.L. Hudson , Seedsman .
-LRB- P.O. Box 1058 , Redwood City , CA , 94064 -RRB- Hudson 's wildly idiosyncratic `` Ethnobotanical Catalog '' -LRB- $ 1 -RRB- had moonflower as `` Calonyction aculeatum , '' though cutting-edge taxonomists have since rechristened this reverse morning-glory `` Ipomoea alba : '' `` Large , white , sweetly scented 3-6 '' wide trumpet-shaped flowers which open rapidly in the evening ... Fast-growing twiner to 10-20 feet , with handsome heart-shaped leaves .
Tropical America '' -LRB- $ 1.25 the packet -RRB- .
Such is the strength of moonflower power in these parts that some summers I have seen moonflower trees covering up for dead street trees in Greenwich Village .
So why not use these lyrical leaping lianas -- plant aerialists that rapidly circumnutate to 10 or 20 feet as annuals in temperate-garden captivity , or to 40 feet as perennials in their edge-of-jungle habitat `` propre ?
'' The New Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening suggests them `` for covering unsightly garden structures , '' while The Cook 's Garden catalog -LRB- P.O. Box 535 , Londonderry , VT 05148 -RRB- recommends : `` A heavenly vine to grow around a porch '' -LRB- $ 1.80 the packet -RRB- .
In 1865 Charles Darwin wrote `` On the Movements of Plants , '' a patient study of scandent plants .
He noted : `` If we observe a circumnutating -LRB- or revolving -RRB- stem ... it generally describes elliptical or oval figures ; for the apex after pointing in any one direction commonly moves back to the opposite side , not , however , returning along the same line .
'' By the same token , we should take the time , at crepuscule , to observe the crepuscular moonflower 's opening .
The long spiral bud unfurls with the precision of an umbrella .
It is as if a florigami master had twisted the bud , folding and compressing the petals by hand , to arrive at purest geometric botanic elegance : the hypocrateriform moonflower .
Yet each moonbloom lasts vespers to matins only -- such exquisite design for a one-night standout !
In `` The Gardener 's Day Book '' -LRB- 1938 -RRB- , Richardson Wright briefly turned his pen to the lunatic noctihorticulturist .
`` Since gardeners are quite mad and go prowling around their places at night ... it is n't at all surprising to find that the mad ones plant flowers which are fragrant only at night ... Vespertine Flowers ... Moonvine can be almost overpowering on hot nights .
'' Indeed , moonflowers innoculate the night with a perfume that seems to overpower description .
The English gardening wit Beverley Nichols , after assaying that moonflower `` fragrance could not be caught in words '' -- tried to catch it anyway : `` a blend of incense and the peel of fresh lemons .
'' To Peter Loewer , illustrator and author of the noctihort book , `` The Evening Garden : Flowers and Fragrance From Dusk Till Dawn '' -LRB- Macmillan , 256 pages , $ 25 , 1993 -RRB- , moonflowers have `` the scent of magnolias .
'' And he hastens to suggest , ooo-ooo-ooo , what a little moonflower can dooo-ooo-ooo .
`` The glow of flickering candles reflected on a trellis of moonflowers and the flower 's sweet fragrance mixing perhaps with the sharp and pungent smell of juniper berries in a perfect martini will lead to a memorable evening .
'' But , lest anthropocentric gardeners assume all this olfactory bliss is meant for them , Deni Bown in `` ALBA : The Book of White Flowers '' -LRB- Timber Press , 1989 -RRB- explains .
`` Odours produced by night-flowering species resemble those put out by the insects themselves in order to attract a mate .
'' Ms. Bown 's attempt to render the moonflower 's `` spellbinder '' scent , `` a fragrance reminiscent of clean clothes that have been folded between bars of soap , '' is itself memorable .
Most fascinating is her explication of the five-point-star shape intaglioed in the moonflower 's face .
Most any hawk moth would recognize it as a nightflower 's semaphore -- a nectar guide : `` highly scented bands of tissue radiating from the center of the flower .
These ` scent patterns ' can be seen -LRB- or smelled , in the case of moths -RRB- as a star-like shape set into the circular white blooms of the aptly named moon flower .
'' On July 20 , 1969 , Neil Armstrong set feet to moon and proclaimed a `` giant leap for mankind .
'' President Richard Nixon hyped this achievement as `` the greatest week in the history of the world since the Creation .
'' But after 25 years and 12 American men on the moon , the consensus on the moon missions is that they have turned out to be not much more than moonpie in the sky .
Definitely not the case with my moonflower mission .
Every successful moonbloom launch boosts this gardener into far-out sublunar orbit .
In -LRB- moon -RRB- light of the above , therefore , I bring up the moon-tech query posed precisely 60 years ago , in the August 1934 , issue of My Garden : An Intimate Magazine for Garden Lovers -LRB- British , of course -RRB- , by one Gilbert McAllister , M.A. -- and still unresolved !
`` Why -- why has no one invented a moondial ?
The moon is as worthy of such an honor as the sun .
Gardens look as lovely by the light of the moon as in all their day-time gaudiness .
'' Perhaps the time has come for NASA to take up the moondial challenge .
Clearly a moondial is one moonspinoff that even a gardener could love , especially a moonflowering gardener bathed in moonshine .
TVX Gold Inc. said it wo n't pursue its proposal to merge some assets of Lac Minerals Ltd. with TVX , a Toronto gold producer .
TVX said last month it was planning a share swap with Lac , in which TVX would acquire Lac 's U.S. and South American assets , and Toronto concern Kinross Gold Corp. would acquire Lac 's Canadian assets .
The transaction was meant to be an alternative to two takeover bids for Lac , and would have required the approval of Lac 's board , TVX said .
TVX president John Hick said TVX had talks with Lac , but Lac `` did n't give us the encouragement '' to hold further talks .
Lac is urging its shareholders not to tender their shares to the `` inadequate '' cash-and-stock takeover bids by Royal Oak Mines Inc. , Vancouver , British Columbia , and American Barrick Resources Corp. , based in Toronto .
Royal Oak 's bid expires tonight , and Barrick 's offer expires Friday .
Lac , a Toronto gold company , said it remains in talks with a third party regarding a new option for Lac shareholders .
NEW YORK -- The dollar continued its weak performance against major currencies yesterday , falling to its lowest level in more than a month against the mark and edging closer to its postwar low against the yen .
In late afternoon New York trading , the dollar was quoted at 1.5278 marks , down from 1.5396 marks late Friday in New York .
The U.S. currency also was changing hands at 97.85 yen , down from 98.70 yen .
Sterling was trading at $ 1.5565 , up from $ 1.5550 .
About noon Tuesday in Tokyo , the dollar was trading at 1.5325 marks and at 98.03 yen ; sterling was at $ 1.5523 .
Traders said there was n't any particular news yesterday to explain the dollar 's weakness .
They said the downward trend was provoked by the growing perception that European interest rates are headed higher , continuing uncertainty over U.S.-Japan trade talks and the market 's eroding confidence in the Clinton administration .
The dollar slipped against the yen in Asian dealings , despite reports of more intervention by the Bank of Japan , and then hovered about one yen above its postwar low of 96.55 yen that it hit July 12 .
Traders said weak U.S. financial markets also helped depress the dollar .
Bond prices were down sharply on the day , with yield for the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond jumping to 7.55 % from 7.48 % late Friday .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 3.89 points lower , at 3751.22 .
Meanwhile the Mexican peso jumped after ruling-party candidate Ernesto Zedillo headed for victory in Sunday 's presidential election .
The dollar fell to 3.3375 new pesos late in New York , from 3.3585 pesos late Friday .
With one-third of the vote counted , the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party had 47.8 % of the vote , a significant lead over opposition parties .
Mexican stocks and bonds also rallied yesterday .
Traders said the dollar recovered from its intraday lows around 3.317 new pesos soon after the Bank of Mexico informed local banks that it had raised the bottom of its daily intervention band to 3.250 new pesos from the previous 3.104 new pesos .
The threat of central bank intervention at that level helped push the new peso off its highs .
Analysts said the Mexican central bank apparently wanted to limit too much volatility in the new peso , which had weakened steadily during the first few months of 1994 amid election uncertainties .
Meanwhile , traders said the dollar outlook is likely to remain gloomy for a while .
`` There 's nothing really new for the dollar , '' said Tom O'Malley , senior foreign-exchange analyst at Technical Data .
`` There 's just a feeling in the market that the dollar 's going down .
'' Mr. O'Malley said the difficulty President Clinton had pushing his crime bill through the House of Representatives and the continuing fight over health-care reform and its costs may be weakening the market 's confidence in his leadership .
`` There 's a total failure of buyers to materialize , '' said Alfonso Alejo , vice president at Sakura Bank in New York .
He said Japan 's trade surplus with the U.S. and the perception that there has n't been any progress in the trade talks probably will continue to put pressure on the dollar against the yen .
Mr. O'Malley said the dollar may test 1.5000 marks and 95 yen before a turnaround occurs .
Sakura 's Mr. Alejo said he expects the dollar to test 1.5165 marks and its historic low of 96.55 yen before a correction is seen .
MESSY DESKS are a good sign to many employers -- within limits .
`` The more I see on their desks , the more I figure is going on in their brains , '' says Tom Bedecarre , chairman of San Francisco ad agency Citron Haligman Bedecarre .
James T. Kindley , vice president of marketing for Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing Co. in Fort Worth , Texas , admits he makes jokes when an employee 's desk becomes too chaotic , but he adds , `` I 'm always a bit suspicious about people who have a pencil tray and a totally clean desktop .
'' Still , Fidelity Investments discourages clutter in offices where workers meet with clients .
The capital bureau of the American Statesman in Austin , Texas , prodded reporters to clean their desks when movers had trouble moving file cabinets through the aisles .
Citron Haligman , despite its chairman 's love of clutter , gives a `` Clean Desk of the Month '' award .
The prize ?
Windex .
Some bosses say order is worth even more .
Jeffrey Mayer , author of `` Winning the Fight Between You and Your Desk , '' receives about $ 1,000 for helping offices combat clutter .
UNIONIZATION : Does it increase the likelihood a firm will go out of business ?
No , say researchers Richard Freeman and Morris Kleiner , who prepared a paper on the subject for the National Bureau of Economic Research .
They examined more than 300 firms and business lines between 1983 and 1990 , separating those that folded from those that did not .
They then assessed the union presence in each category .
`` The probability that union firms , or business lines , or union workers suffer plant closures or insolvency is not discernibly different from that of nonunion entities , '' the researchers said .
Unions do reduce company profits by raising wages of workers but do n't `` destroy the goose that lays the golden egg , '' the researchers concluded .
`` GO HOME !
'' employers urge late workers , but some do n't heed the advice .
`` In the past few years , we 've been trying to suggest it is necessary to work hard but not necessarily longer hours , '' says I. Charles Mathews , director of work-force diversity at United Technologies Corp. .
But cost cutting and the elimination of management layers make it difficult to leave on time .
United Technologies has started a `` time management '' program , in which late stayers are pulled aside and told , `` It 's the results that count , '' Mr. Mathews says .
AlliedSignal Inc. encourages its business facilities to build fitness and day-care centers to help workers balance work and personal lives .
Some firms see social activities as a sign of interpersonal skills necessary for promotion .
Frank Schmidt , professor of human resources at the University of Iowa , says there is an `` imperfect correlation between the amount of time spent at the office and the amount of work done .
'' MOTHER NURTURE : Women-owned firms are more likely to offer flex-time , tuition reimbursement and job sharing , according to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners .
Some 40 % of women-owned businesses offer flex-time , while only 30 % of all small firms and 19 % of firms with 25 or more employees do .
And 21 % of firms owned by women offer tuition reimbursement , compared with only 8 % of all small businesses .
JOBS ARE THE TOP CONCERN in cities world-wide .
A United Nations survey of 135 mayors from every continent found unemployment to be the No. 1 urban problem , followed by inadequate housing .
In Boston , which analysts said highlights the concerns of American cities , worry about unemployment was followed by anxiety involving high-school dropouts and lack of day care .
REAL WORLD job training , though popular , has limits , according to a new National Research Council book , `` Learning , Remembering , Believing : Enhancing Human Performance .
'' Learning abstract principles and varied situations makes workers more flexible and able to handle unpredictable problems , the book says .
U.S. PAY RAISES will average 4.2 % next year , but many wo n't feel better off .
The Wyatt Co. , an international consulting firm , surveyed more than 2,200 companies and found that consumer-software firms will give the best pay raises in the country next year , averaging 5.5 % .
The transportation sector will do the worst , with pay raises of only 3.5 % .
There were only slight variations in pay increases between executives , middle managers and hourly workers .
Many workers wo n't feel that much richer because consumer prices are expected to rise 3.2 % next year , exceeding this year 's expected 2.7 % increase .
With such low raises , employers will try other ways to match pay to performance , such as offering pay rewards for work groups that meet high goals , or giving workers a cut of company profits , Wyatt says .
The grass is greener in Asia .
Managers in the Philippines and Indonesia can expect raises of 16 % and 13 % next year , far outstripping inflation , says consultant William M. Mercer Inc. .
THE CHECKOFF : The Open Society City of Sarajevo Project in New Haven , Conn. , is recruiting university-level lecturers to teach in the war-ravaged city during the fall ... If you have had five or more jobs in the past 10 years , you are likely to be considered a `` job-hopper , '' says staffing firm Robert Half International Inc. .
In July 1986 Wilmer `` Buddy '' Parker , a federal prosecutor from Atlanta , met in Aruba with a criminal defendant who did not want to go to jail , in the hope of persuading him to become an informant .
The prosecutor , who hoped to make a major cocaine case , ended up with far more information than he thought he would .
In December 1987 , an employee of an armored car service noticed there was a hole in one of the cartons he was transporting from a jeweler named Orosimo in New York 's jewelry district to a company called Ropex in the Los Angeles jewelry district .
Pursuant to company policy for inspecting damaged parcels -LRB- and motivated perhaps by curiosity -RRB- , the employee opened the parcel -- described as containing gold scrap and jewelry -- and found $ 800,000 in currency .
In early January 1988 , a loan officer in the Monterey Park branch of Wells Fargo called a bank investigator to complain that a customer -- a jeweler -- was making huge cash deposits in the branch , distracting employees and creating a security hazard .
From these threads and many others Ann Woolner weaves a fascinating story about the unraveling of the largest narcotics money-laundering operation prosecuted to date -- a collection of cases known as Polar Cap .
I first heard of Polar Cap as a customs case ; later I heard it was done by the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
In her recounting of the bureaucratic clashing of gears that passes for cooperation in law-enforcement circles , Ms. Woolner makes it clear that the case was handled by a host of people , generally working toward a common purpose but frequently not doing it together .
`` Like a giant jigsaw puzzle that had been scattered everywhere , pieces of La Mina -LCB- the name for the money-laundering business -RCB- suddenly were turning up all over the place .
But they were landing in the hands of different agencies in different cities and none of the holders of the clues knew about each other .
All of them figured they were onto a drug money laundry of considerable size .
But what were its dimensions , and how did it work ?
Who ran it , and who were they servicing ?
'' These are just some of the questions Ms. Woolner poses and answers in `` Washed in Gold : The Story Behind the Biggest Money-Laundering Investigation in U.S. History '' -LRB- Simon & Schuster , 391 pages , $ 25 -RRB- .
This is an exceptionally complicated tale written in a manner that flows and makes sense of widely disparate events .
Based on trial transcripts , official records and hundreds of interviews , it is fascinating both for the story it tells and for the insights it gives into our law-enforcement personnel and their agencies .
One of the companies laundering narcotics money was purportedly buying gold from Uruguay -- and had invoices to prove it .
But when an expert heard that story , he laughed .
Uruguay has no gold , he knew , and hence the informant 's story about the transactions could not be true .
The expert was right that Uruguay has no gold , but the informant 's story was true ; it was the invoices that were false .
The laundry was buying nothing , and paying for it with real money .
In that way narcotics proceeds were withdrawn from the U.S. using our banking system .
Ms. Woolner also cites a case in which the Drug Enforcement Administration obtained a court order authorizing the videotaped surveillance of the room at the Los Angeles jewelry business in which cash was counted .
During the surveillance , which had to be `` minimized '' to avoid recording overtly noncriminal activity , the agent saw two employees start to engage in sex .
He called headquarters and asked for instructions : `` What do we do now ?
'' The agent feared that recording the couple 's sexual activity would get the DEA in trouble .
After his superior asked for a detailed description of what was happening , he made a call only a law-enforcement professional would make .
`` As long as there 's money on the table , '' he said , `` you keep that camera going .
'' Polar Cap was a major milestone in the war against narcotics .
It revealed the existence for the first time of major money-laundering operations separate and apart from the drug distribution networks .
According to the money launderers , who did n't realize they were talking to law-enforcement personnel , narcotics distributors would turn cash over to the launderers , after which the cash would be the responsibility of the launderers .
One of the most interesting episodes described in the book was when cops seized $ 1 million and the dealers attempted to find out who was responsible for the loss -- their people or the money launderers .
The implications of Polar Cap are that law enforcement should take on this sort of case more frequently .
We should target the money distribution system -- as has been done in New York both by federal and county agencies -- and use a greater percentage of our prosecutorial resources to go after the businesspeople , bankers and lawyers who intentionally assist the cartels with transferring their narcotics profits home .
Ms. Woolner 's book , which was sufficiently entrancing to make me miss my subway stop for the first time in years , poses serious questions for the future that we would do well to consider .

German machinery and engineering group Mannesmann AG reported its first-half group loss narrowed sharply to 27 million marks -LRB- $ 17.6 million -RRB- from 467 million marks a year earlier .
It predicted a full-year profit .
Sales in the period rose 10 % to 14.2 billion marks .
Order inflow during the first half rose 19 % to 16.9 billion marks .
Mannesmann said the `` clear improvement '' in the first half is the result of reduced costs and expanded business .
During the latest reporting period , Mannesmann Mobilfunk , the group 's cellular-telephone unit , posted its first six-month profit since it was founded in 1989 .
The company did n't release specific figures for the telephone unit .
Mannesmann also cited a marked improvement in the automotive technology sector `` despite the persistently restrained '' automotive market .
Sales in the sector rose 10 % .
Citic Pacific Ltd. , a Chinese-controlled conglomerate based in Hong Kong , said its net income surged 45 % for the first half .
It forecast `` substantially increased earnings '' for the full year .
Citic earned 1.17 billion Hong Kong dollars -LRB- US$ 151.4 million -RRB- , compared with HK$ 802.3 million a year earlier .
Revenue rose 6.1 % to HK$ 6.55 billion .
Citic Pacific , which has interests in aviation , utilities , manufacturing and property , among other things , said the motor-trading business in mainland China and its traditional market of Hong Kong remained competitive but that the margin matched that achieved a year earlier .
Otherwise , Citic cited satisfactory performance by several investments , such as Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Ltd. , Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd. , Ligang Power Station , chemical treatment group Enviropace and Manhattan Card Co. .
Kirby Corp. said operating losses are prompting it to discontinue direct , all-water containership service from Memphis , Tenn. , to Mexico and Central America tomorrow .
Houston-based Kirby said the service , operated by its Americas Marine Express unit , had operating losses of about $ 1.35 million , or an after-tax loss of $ 900,000 , or three cents a share , between its February inception and June 30 .
Operating losses for July through tomorrow , including anticipated shutdown expenses , are estimated at $ 1 million , or two cents a share , the marine transportation concern said .
The company said that while it considered the service `` operationally feasible , '' aggressive pricing from competitors kept profits at bay even though Kirby said its volumes were slowly increasing .
Kirby reported second-quarter net income of $ 3.2 million , or 11 cents a share .
I was saddened to read your Marketplace piece Aug. 2 , in which you report that British Customs is refusing entry for Spock dolls on the grounds that Spock is `` non-human .
'' Certainly my friend Spock has taken great pride in his Vulcan heritage .
But to deprive the English people of the company of such a favorite seems to me a sadly inhuman act .
Knoll AG , the pharmaceutical unit of German chemical maker BASF AG , Ludwigshafen , Germany , said it is entering the generic drugs market by buying rights to 80 medications from Hexal Pharma GmbH .
Knoll paid in the `` very low end '' of the double-digit millions of marks for the pharmaceuticals package , a spokesman said .
Knoll hopes to reach annual sales of at least 100 million marks -LRB- $ 65 million -RRB- in the generic drugs market within three to five years .
Knoll also bought registrations for the medications , which will allow it to produce the generic drugs without enduring an approval process that could take up to eight years , the spokesman added .
Unlike a licensing agreement , there are no continuing fees to be paid for the rights to the generic medicines , he said .
Also , Holskirchen-based Hexal Pharma will be able to continue producing the drugs as well .
The package of registrations focus on generic drugs used for the treatment of circulatory and nervous-system ailments .

Sales rose 13 % to 1.5 billion marks .
Wella said the increase in sales reflected the acquisition in 1993 of hair-care product lines from SmithKline Beecham PLC , as well as the first-time consolidation of U.S.-based Sebastian International Inc. .
Without these acquisitions , six-month sales would have risen a `` still good '' 4 % , the group said .
Sales in North and South America , as well as most Pacific Rim nations , saw double-digit growth in the period , Wella added .
For the full year , Wella predicted sales would rise about 20 % to about 3.5 billion marks .
Your July 25th editorial `` God and Prime Ministers '' completely misses the point to the criticism of the Christian Right .
It is not only the Vaclav Havels of the world who understand what tyranny really is .
Our founding fathers understood a tyranny much longer than that of Nazism , fascism or communism -- namely the tyranny of religious bigotry under the auspices of the church that persisted for over a millennium .
The European experience gave rise to the principle of separation of church and state , which is enshrined in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and remains dear to a shrinking minority of Americans -- yourselves , apparently , excluded .
When thinking Americans are alarmed by experiments with our religious liberties , such as government-mandated prayer in a compulsory educational setting , we follow James Madison 's sage advice .
While it is true that most Americans share many moral concerns with the Christian Right , myself included , we do not necessarily share the proposed solution .
It is hardly alarmist to suggest that the Christian Right 's agenda , if completely successful , could result in a renewal of religious tyranny in this country .
It is not always evil men gaining power for evil purposes who are to be feared , but good men obtaining power for ostensibly noble purposes .
One need not question the motives or values of the Christian Right to be alarmed at the prospect of a spiritual takeover of America .
Your editorial `` God and Prime Ministers '' reminded me of the compulsory religion course I took at Drew University , where former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean -LRB- mentioned in the editorial -RRB- now serves as president .
In 1952 , Professor Heisse Johnson , a devout and excellent Methodist minister , told us all about the problems of church and state that the early Americans had inherited .
There were Czechs , Slovaks and Bohemians burning each other and throwing each other out of windows in the name of God , there were the Orthodox Bulgarians fighting first Roman Catholics and then Muslim Turks with a very special kind of barbarism , in the name of God .
He reminded us that the Pilgrims who came here in 1620 seeking religious freedom gave way to the Puritans who in 1630 hanged their first Quaker on the Boston Common in the name of God .
The Cold War is only part of European history .
Please let us not forget the rest .
You should not make simplistic judgments about benevolent religion and the state .
What we should learn from Europe was taught in those countries represented by Prime Ministers Havel and Dimitrov .
You might also remind former Governor Kean we learned our lessons well at Drew .
Your editorial extolling the virtues of blurring the lines separating church and state in America struck me as another case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend .
It 's hard to believe you 're suggesting that the personal experiences and beliefs of a former Bulgarian prime minister and the Czech Republic 's president are persuasive enough to have Americans abandon the wisdom of our Founding Fathers and of our highest courts .
Music retailer Trans World Music Corp. said its fiscal second-quarter loss widened from a year ago , even as samestore sales increased slightly .
For the three months ended July 30 , the company reported a net loss of $ 2.8 million , or 29 cents a share , compared with a loss of $ 2 million , or 21 cents a share , a year earlier .
Sales were $ 107 million , up about 11 % from $ 96.6 million , a year ago .
Comparable store sales -- sales from stores open at least one year -- were up 1 % , the company said .
`` The process of rebalancing our merchandise inventories is underway , but as we warned , we do n't anticipate meaningful results until the second half of the year , '' said Robert Higgins , chairman and chief executive of the Albany , N.Y. , company .
For the six months , Trans World reported a loss of $ 4.7 million , or 48 cents a share , compared with a loss of $ 2.4 million , or 24 cents a share .
Sales in the six months rose to $ 216.2 million , up 8 % from $ 199.9 million .
Same-store sales , a key economic indicator , fell 2 % during a period when the music industry was showing strong gains .
Sorry to sound another alarm as summer 's final weeks slip away , but have you insured property lately ?
Homeowners in catastrophe-prone areas , including much of California and other stretches of the nation 's coastline , are finding it hard to land a policy .
The result may be to partner this risk-mitigation business with Washington .
Some lawmakers say this is needed because the insurance industry is sinking under its obligations , and desirable because the feds have been saddled with cleanup costs anyway and ought to be able to demand better preparedness in return .
However , this heralds more bureaucracy and up-front cost for all Americans .
Morever , as the thrift fiasco demonstrated , socializing risk via the U.S. Treasury is an unnatural disaster in the making .
The crux of the crisis is in California , where hundreds of thousands of homeowners are scrambling for coverage as insurers back out of the market .
Earthquakes are the big uncertainty .
This year 's Northridge jolt will result in $ 7 billion in claims ; estimates of exposure to a more catastrophic temblor exceed $ 100 billion .
But similar if more manageable problems apply wherever destructive winds , floods or fires recur .
If God has n't come up with any new acts , why are our financial shields suddenly inadequate ?
Some point to the surprisingly violent `` vertical thrust '' of the January quake , which seems to have created new appreciation of nature 's wrath .
Yet laws of man explain a good part of California 's insurance problem .
First , the legislature in 1984 required all homeowner-policy writers to offer earthquake coverage .
Predictably , customers near the most dangerous faults signed up in the largest numbers .
One carrier estimates that every $ 1 in premiums brings $ 100 in exposure -LRB- and the `` event '' is better than a 100-to-1 shot -RRB- .
Then the state voters approved price controls for the insurance industry in 1988 .
Although this measure was aimed primarily at auto policies it extended to homeowner\/quake coverage .
How much Proposition 103 has contributed to underfinancing risk is unknown .
The industry does n't provide much pricing data , citing antitrust concerns .
But some set of circumstances has threatened 20th Century Insurance , for example , with insolvency .
20th Century is a high-volume , bargain-rate operator that was a model business until it was caught heavily exposed at Northridge .
Like all California insurers , however , it was being undermined beforehand .
It has battled the elected commissioner , John Garamendi , for nearly four years over 103 's auto-premium rollback .
Last week , the state Supreme Court sided with the regulator .
Clearly , price controls deter enterprise .
But , funny thing , the California home-policy market was nevertheless competitive until recently .
So much so , that companies avoided confronting policyholders with the need to increase coverage because they did n't want to lose them with higher premiums .
Political sensitivity may have figured in that , too .
Meanwhile , insurers have seen big surprises on the payout end .
Policy holders typically gripe about the size or speed of their reimbursement , and in the case of the Northridge quake have objected when checks were issued jointly to them and the lender that may own 80 % of the home .
But California carriers have their own beefs .
Most notably in the Oakland Hills fire in 1991 , which charred 3,000 homes overlooking San Francisco Bay , they 've been worked over by lawyers , politicians and an organizer-agitator named Ina DeLong .
A former claims supervisor for State Farm Insurance , Ms. DeLong now shows up dependably at disasters to corral policy holders of the major insurers into company-focused groups to demand their due .
There 's nothing wrong with that , except when the expectations are extreme and are backed by political pressure .
Say the insured lived in a custom house that might have sold for $ 500,000 but cost $ 1 million to re-create .
If the settlement is bent toward the higher , `` total replacement '' cost -- insured or not -- soon all contractors in the neighborhood are working at a premium .
Some insurers complain this is basically what happened in Oakland , particularly after Mr. Garamendi fined Allstate $ 750,000 for sluggishness in handling claims .
In California alone , the string of calamities over the last five years has been staggering : the 1989 San Francisco quake , followed by the Oakland blaze , the L.A. riots , the Malibu and Laguna fires and then Northridge .
The Legislature , which once before established a quake insurance fund only to scrap it when faced with the enormity of the indemnity , this week is completing a stop-gap response to the homeowner-policy crisis .
Some of the bills are designed to take the industry off the worst hooks temporarily by shifting costs .
But others , including one pushed by state Sen. Art Torres , the Democratic nominee for insurance commissioner , would codify standards such as an insurer obligation to pay restoration costs even if the homeowner decides to pocket the funds and buy another place .
Beyond the next year or two , most working on the issue say only the federal government is big enough to backstop the insurers .
Hurricanes Hugo , Andrew and Iniki contributed to that belief .
Rep. Norman Mineta of California is heading the push in the House and Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii is the catalyst in the Senate .
No action is likely this session , but even some on the GOP right have signed on to creating a federal fund from which insurers can draw in disasters exceeding about $ 4 billion in claims .
The private market for this reinsurance has been tapped dry in the U.S. .
The new money is to be raised by the industry through mass-market premiums reflective of locational risk , with the Treasury 's borrowing as a supplement .
In return , Washington would get added muscle in enforcing building codes and other previously local land-use regulations .
Everyone would pay for this undertaking via a surcharge on insurance bills .
The whole monitoring and rate-setting responsibility would fall on that familiar crisis catch-all of recent years , the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
Because FEMA and federal taxpayers seem caught up in every calamity anyway , this approach seems penny-wise to some .
Congressional staffers are by now mindful of the potential abuses in a program of tax-backed guarantees .
But that does n't mean those can be avoided , or that this plan is going to be administered any better than the longstanding federal flood insurance program , which did n't much cushion the 1993 blow in the Midwest .
`` Mandates '' and `` universal coverage '' have been fighting words in the health-care debate , but the same principles are at issue in disaster-relief policy .
The insurance industry is no fun to deal with in either area , but a good look at how politics and unlimited expectations have pushed both sectors to the brink ought to precede an expansion of Washington 's power .
I read with interest your August 3 page-one article , in which you glean lessons for a possible invasion of Haiti , from the 1989 invasion of Panama -LRB- `` Mixed Message : As U.S. Looks at Haiti , Its Invasion of Panama Shows Limited Results '' -RRB- .
I must point out , however , several instances in which this process is conducted to the unjust detriment and expense of Panama 's image .
We have revisited several times the bare statement , always imputed to unnamed senior U.S. officials , that drug-money laundering now occurs in Panama at levels higher than in the Noriega years .
Neither the U.S. nor anyone else has any statistics on drug-money laundering during Mr. Noriega 's rule .
Unfortunately , this lack of numbers does not prevent the media from periodically reviving the assertion .
Despite countless repetitions , the statement remains nothing more than an empty attention-seeking sound-bite .
Panama has never refused to provide an accounting of the number of invasion casualties -- approximately 500 Panamanian deaths during the invasion .
The investigation remains open even though no new evidence or grieving families have come forth to cause a substantial revision of Panama 's conclusions .
The great aggravation of Panama 's social problems , brought on by a year and a half of U.S. sanctions , will take many years to correct .
President Endara has pointed to Panama 's limited resources as a hindrance to progress in social programs .
Yet , despite limitations , our economy has grown 7 % between 1990 and 1994 .
The post-invasion unemployment rate of 25 % has dropped to 12 % .
These results are proof of a commitment , unacknowledged by your article , to correct social ills .
As you point out , Panama 's economy has experienced a boom , though most economic indicators have only recently reached pre-1989 levels .
We have great expectations of seeing continued , healthy growth , and , with it , increased resources to address the ills that Panama shares with all nations , regardless of wealth .
Immunex Corp. , Seattle , said it 's moved a step closer toward understanding a blood-cell growth factor that could help in chemotherapy recovery , bone-marrow transplants and gene therapy .
The company , which develops products to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases and is 55 % - owned by American Cyanamid Co. , said it will present six papers at a scientific conference this week , detailing a blood-cell growth factor that Immunex discovered and cloned earlier this year .
The factor , called Flt3 ligand , boosted the growth of stem cells , which are the fundamental type of cell from which blood and immune-system cells arise .
Stimulating the growth of stem cells could increase a patient 's white cells , which are often reduced during cancer treatments .
A number of different scientific groups have been searching for the factors .
NEW YORK -- The New York state attorney general is expected today to challenge the proposed merger of Federated Department Stores Inc. with R.H. Macy & Co. .
Spokesmen for Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell declined to elaborate on the topic of a `` major '' news conference set for 11 a.m. EDT here .
Spokeswomen for Macy and Federated said they did n't know what would be announced .
Under the proposed merger , Macy would emerge from bankruptcy court protection and the two companies would form the nation 's biggest department-store retailer .
It could n't be determined whether the state plans to sue to block the combination altogether or whether it would use a `` fix-it-first '' approach , in which legal action is threatened unless the parties meet certain conditions such as the sale of some stores .
BETHLEHEM , Pa. -- When 14-year-old Paul McHale was a ninth-grader at Nitschmann Junior High , a teacher began his political education with a book : John F. Kennedy 's `` Profiles in Courage .
'' Now , with the slain president 's photograph hanging on his office wall , freshman Democratic Rep. Paul McHale of Pennsylvania has a chance to prove his own mettle .
As a deeply divided House braces for debate on comprehensive health-care reform , Majority Leader Richard Gephardt describes the battle as `` about the courage of this Congress .
'' Mr. McHale , 44 , says no to Mr. Gephardt 's reform plan : That is , he says no to employer mandates he fears will sink struggling small businesses in his district ; no to the possibility of eroding health benefits for union retirees ; no to what he calls a `` socialized '' new program of costly federal entitlements .
His fellow freshman from Pennsylvania , Republican Jim Greenwood , 43 , is even more ardently opposed to President Clinton 's agenda .
But the two lawmakers are precisely the kind of political moderates considered central to Mr. Clinton 's original hopes for a bipartisan reform majority .
Both won their seats in 1992 by promising solutions on the health-care issue .
`` There will be no excuse for inaction , '' Mr. McHale , the Democrat , declared at the time .
The debate they joined on Capitol Hill has since grown thick with excuses .
As their experiences show , the saga of health-care `` reform '' is one of missed opportunities and increasing partisanship , but it also is one of deep ambivalence among the half-million Americans each lawmaker represents .
Lately , residents back home have been more concerned about crime , and Reps. McHale and Greenwood both voted for the crime bill that the House passed Sunday .
But it was Pennsylvania that sounded the trumpets for national health reform three years ago when Sen. Harris Wofford rode the issue to victory .
When they arrived in Washington 19 months ago , Reps. McHale and Greenwood shared more than just a home state .
Born 10 months apart during Harry Truman 's postwar presidency , they moved through the state legislature together during the 1980s .
Each cuts against the grain of his party : Mr. McHale , representing the old factory towns of Allentown and Bethlehem , is a Marine veteran who served in the Persian Gulf War that most congressional Democrats opposed ; Mr. Greenwood , whose district embraces the high-income suburbs and fashionable country homes of Bucks County , is a pro-choice GOP moderate whose first career was as a social worker .
Both used the health issue to advantage while ousting battle-scarred incumbents in 1992 .
With President Bush under attack for shunning domestic issues , Mr. Greenwood decried `` piecemeal '' reform and offered his own 10-point plan to increase access and curb costs .
He ousted veteran Democratic Rep. Peter Kostmayer .
Mr. McHale , staking out the political center like Bill Clinton , campaigned for universal coverage .
He embraced a `` new Democrat '' reform alternative that allowed him to isolate and defeat conservative GOP Rep. Don Ritter .
`` People wanted to believe , '' Mr. Ritter recalls ruefully .
`` If you cared about people , you were for universal coverage .
'' At first , Mr. Greenwood was better positioned to influence the health-care debate .
He won a seat on the pivotal House Energy and Commerce Committee , which had first crack at writing reform legislation .
To keep his options open , he declined to endorse his own Republican party leadership 's reform plan as well as Mr. Clinton 's .
Early this year , however , the lawmaker drew the line he would n't cross : supporting a government guarantee of universal coverage .
Mr. Greenwood himself has been blessed with high-quality care .
Seven-year-old daughter Katie , with whom he shares piano lessons each Saturday , and eight-year-old Laura both were born with cleft palates requiring tens of thousands of dollars ' worth of surgery and rehabilitative therapy .
Most of the cost was covered by Pennsylvania 's state-employees benefits package .
But though he is willing to support some subsidies to help low-income Americans afford similar protection , he rejects the notion that it should be a government-ensured right .
`` I believe that rights are freedoms , not the assurance of any benefits , '' he says , sitting in the kitchen of his early 19th-century home in Erwinna .
So , earlier this year , he calmed concerns among Republicans and small-business lobbyists who feared he might back Mr. Clinton 's proposed requirement that employers buy health insurance for their workers .
`` He told us we had absolutely nothing to worry about , '' says John Motley , chief lobbyist of the National Federation of Independent Business , the largest trade group representing small businesses .
With the GOP united on that critical issue -- and joined by a few conservative Democrats -- Energy and Commerce Chairman John Dingell could n't produce a majority for anything close to President Clinton 's original proposal .
That left the administration and Democratic leaders this summer looking toward people like Rep. McHale as they aimed for a narrow , Democrats-only victory on the House floor .
By then , Mr. McHale was n't in a particularly receptive mood , however .
He backs President Clinton 's goal of universal coverage and some tax increases to pay for it .
But he had cringed at the product of Hillary Rodham Clinton 's vaunted health-reform task force -- `` a 1,300-page term paper , '' he says -- and bristled at White House attacks on Democratic Tennessee Rep. Jim Cooper 's `` managed competition '' plan to expand health coverage without employer mandates .
That is the plan Mr. McHale embraced himself in 1992 .
Meanwhile , Whitewater and other distractions eroded Mr. Clinton 's personal political standing .
Over the Memorial Day weekend , Mr. McHale announced at a meeting with home-district hospital officials that he would oppose the president 's health-reform plan as too bureaucratic and damaging to the economy .
Reps. Greenwood and McHale alike discovered this spring and summer that there was little political cost to bucking the president .
Tepid support for reform was largely a matter of numbers : Amid rising doubts about the administration 's proposal , the 91 % of Pennsylvanians who currently have health coverage are n't clamoring to rejigger the system for the 9 % who do n't .
Throughout the congressional debate , the medical industry and business in general , which contributed more than $ 300,000 to Mr. Greenwood 's $ 730,000 campaign in 1992 , turned steadily more hostile to the administration .
Nor were Mr. Greenwood 's affluent Bucks County constituents particularly enthusiastic about the issue ; at his town meetings , they were more interested in talking about crime than health reform .
`` If we do n't get it done this session , '' he says , `` most of my constituents will probably be pleased .
'' Attempts to generate some political heat back home mostly fell flat .
One proadministration reform group staged a protest outside Mr. Greenwood 's Doylestown office , but it drew fewer than a dozen people .
In Mr. McHale 's district , by contrast , there are powerful voices on Mr. Clinton 's side .
Bethlehem Steel Corp. , where the congressman 's father worked for years as a middle manager , wants comprehensive reform to help remove the burden of early retirees and end the market distortions that drive up its medical costs .
So do other manufacturers that have negotiated union contracts with generous benefits .
So do the unions , which form the heart of Mr. McHale 's political base and contributed nearly half his $ 222,000 campaign treasury in 1992 .
Yet much has changed in the Lehigh Valley since the early 1980s recession , when Billy Joel 's `` Allentown '' made the region a symbol of broken Rust Belt economic dreams .
Today , just as many of Mr. McHale 's constituents work for health-insurance companies as work for Bethlehem Steel , whose local work force has declined from a peak of 29,000 a half-century ago to about 4,000 currently .
That figure itself is slated to be cut by another 1,700 within a few years .
The local economy is increasingly dependent on small businesses , including some 800 NFIB members , whose Washington lobbyists warn bluntly against backing Mr. Clinton 's employer mandate .
`` He 'll lose that district if he does , '' says the federation 's Mr. Motley .
`` The center of gravity has shifted , '' says Mr. McHale .
Thus the Democrat 's fifth-floor quarters in the Cannon House Office Building in Washington recently witnessed a striking sequence of lobbying encounters : Hap Wagner , chief executive officer of Allentown-based Air Products Inc. , a mostly nonunion company that manufactures industrial gases , urged Mr. McHale to oppose the House Democratic health bill that Mr. Gephardt has substituted for Mr. Clinton 's .
Later , Bill George , president of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO , came by to urge him to support it .
Mr. McHale reassured Mr. Wagner and disappointed Mr. George .
`` I do n't believe in outdated theories , '' Mr. McHale declared the next day in a campaign debate at Bethlehem 's Moravian College with both his Republican and third-party opponents .
He criticized Mr. Gephardt 's proposal for imposing mandates on struggling small businesses and for a `` disastrously misguided '' plan to cover many of the uninsured through an expanded Medicare program .
Administration backers , citing the decades of grief Republicans suffered for opposing Social Security and Medicare , warn that opposing reform would be a historic and costly mistake .
But the shift in public attitudes since those reforms came through clearly one recent evening as Mr. McHale pored over some 150 letters from constituents on health reform .
Their overarching message , he says , was a simple one : `` fear of government .
'' Now that fear fuels increasingly ardent attacks on the administration 's position from business and medical lobbies .
Congressional Republicans , who once worried about charges of obstructionism , have grown emboldened as well .
Mr. Greenwood himself has been swept up in the partisan momentum , signing on to the Republican `` Theme Team '' attacking hot-button elements of Mr. Gephardt 's bill and joining more conservative colleagues in signing a no-tax pledge .
And while he is supporting an 11th-hour nod to bipartisanship -- offered by Mr. Cooper , Mr. McHale 's erstwhile ally -- mounting GOP strength has pulled the plan rightward , stripping its central cost-control and revenue-raising measures .
For his part , Mr. McHale says those changes have left Mr. Cooper 's plan too slender to support .
Meanwhile , the centrist proposal he approves of -- offered in the Senate by Majority Leader George Mitchell -- has little chance in the House because a combination of liberals and Republicans are n't expected to support it .
`` We have not moved toward the middle , '' complains Mr. McHale .
Instead of compromise , `` What I 've seen is a hardening of opinion , fracturing and polarizing the members of the House .
'' But , `` Politics is not just about logic , it 's about emotion as well , '' Mr. McHale said earlier this summer .
And a swirl of emotions -- desire to rescue a struggling Democratic president , to avoid an embarrassing congressional failure , to grasp a historic chance at reform -- all could play on his decision as the House prepares for floor votes in coming weeks .
A Democratic debacle on health could jeopardize Mr. McHale 's marginal seat , which already has party leaders worried , given the incumbent 's own meager fund raising , GOP candidate Jim Yeager 's personal wealth and the generally promising outlook for Republican challengers this fall .
Democratic leaders also have signaled they may adjust their bill to accommodate waverers .
Mr. McHale says he could support an employer mandate if small businesses were protected .
But room for last-minute tinkering is limited , and some of his concerns are contradictory .
He worries that Mr. Gephardt 's plan would increase the deficit , but also that its subsidies and benefits would n't be generous enough .
In the end , the leadership must make it as difficult as possible for people like Rep. McHale to defect in a showdown vote .
`` He wo n't get everything he wants , '' says Rep. Benjamin Cardin , a Maryland Democrat who is a key negotiator for the leadership .
`` If he 's looking for another train to come down the tracks , it wo n't .
It 's going to come down to voting for universal health-care coverage or nothing .
Paul 's got to come to a decision .
'' Even the counsel of old hometown friends may not be much help .
It would be `` nice '' to assure all Americans health coverage , says Mike Zapp , the civics teacher who once gave Mr. McHale a copy of `` Profiles in Courage .
'' But he also complains of being `` taxed right up through the nose '' to support `` loafers .
'' And so from Bethlehem , he watches the shifting debate with a mix of confusion and disgust .
`` Right now , '' says Mr. Zapp , `` I think Congress is a mess .
'' Johnson & Johnson , seeking a boost for its lethargic consumer-products sector , agreed to acquire Neutrogena Corp. for $ 924.1 million , or $ 35.25 a share .

The tender offer also was 23 % above Friday 's closing stock price , sparking a surge in trading of Neutrogena shares , which closed in Nasdaq Stock Market trading at $ 34.766 , up $ 6.016 , or 21 % .
J&J closed at $ 49.125 , up 12.5 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
For J&J , Neutrogena 's soaps , skin creams and shampoos will enhance a $ 4.8 billion-a-year consumer products business that includes such popular products as Johnson 's baby shampoo and baby oil , Clean & Clear toiletries , Shower to Shower powder , Tylenol pain killers , Band-Aid bandages and Reach toothbrushes .
In recent years , J&J 's consumer-product growth has been `` quite anemic , '' said Kurt Kruger , an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist .
The business , representing about a third of the New Brunswick , N.J. , company 's total annual revenue , grew by only 1 % last year .
The J&J transaction is the latest among drug companies scrambling to respond to upheaval in the pharmaceuticals marketplace , where managed-care institutions are exerting tremendous pressure on drug prices .
Companies are adopting different strategies , including diversifying into the consumer-products business to build a buffer against the turmoil in the drug and medical industries .
J&J last year had sales of $ 4.5 billion in pharmaceuticals , and $ 4.8 billion in sales of medical supplies .
Longer term , analyst Diana K. Temple of Salomon Brothers Inc. said that Neutrogena offers J&J a good channel for new consumer products , expecially because it has `` this longstanding relationship with dermatologists -- more than most skin-care companies have .
'' J&J ownership will also greatly improve Neutrogena 's ability to bring new items to market , she said .
For Neutrogena , which has grown fast domestically but has had problems with European markets , the emergence of J&J as its mystery suitor also answers strategic questions .
Analysts had speculated that Unilever or another European multinational giant might be interested , because Neutrogena 's most significant need of late has been marketing abroad , especially in the competitive European market .
Neutrogena has encountered slow going in international market-building , which it does primarily through the European pharmacies that have strong ties to dermatologists there .
In the U.S. , Neutrogena 's thrust lately has been to expand beyond its drugstore and mass-merchandise outlets into more specialized mall and other stores .
The company 's net income for the nine months ended July 31 rose 1.7 % to $ 15.7 million , or 61 cents a share , on a 6.4 % rise in sales to $ 211.3 million .
`` We have an international presence that Neutrogena does n't have , '' a J&J spokesman said .
`` Under the Johnson & Johnson umbrella , that presence should be greatly enhanced .
'' Lloyd E. Cotsen , Neutrogena 's chairman and chief executive officer , said the acquisition will enhance Neutrogena 's `` stated corporate goal -- to be a growth-oriented company with an image for credibility and trust '' in the skin-care and hair-care businesses .
Mr. Cotsen 's 38 % ownership of Neutrogena will be worth $ 348 million in the transaction .
It is n't clear what role the 64-year-old Mr. Cotsen , a 37-year veteran of the company , will have at Neutrogena after the acquisition .
Neutrogena officials did n't return phone calls seeking comment on the company 's joint news release with J&J .
While neither company would discuss the negotiation process , one Neutrogena executive who declined to be identified said that the high price had n't resulted from a bidding war , but rather reflected the premium Mr. Cotsen and J&J had established to discourage competing bids .
`` This is the price it 's been from Day 1 , '' the Neutrogena executive said .
Mr. Cotsen , according to this executive , believed his company would fit well with J&J and felt Neutrogena would be `` best with somebody that is very similar , that he admires a lot .
'' The executive added , `` Lloyd was protecting his people and his trademark .
There was no serious discussion with anybody except these Johnson & Johnson people .
'' Neutrogena , with total 1993 sales of $ 282 million , has 840 employees .
J&J has 79,000 employees in 167 operating companies , with operations in 50 countries .
Under the agreement , J&J will begin a cash offer for all 25.7 million of Neutrogena 's shares .
Mr. Cotsen would tender all his 8,869,000 shares , and all outstanding options to purchase a total of about 2.3 million shares would also be acquired .
The offer , which begins Friday and is open for at least 20 business days , is subject to J&J 's acquisition of a majority of stock in Neutrogena , among other conditions .
Terms provide that if Neutrogena agrees to any unsolicited alternative transaction , J&J would receive a $ 27.5 million fee .
Lehman Brothers Inc. provided financial advice to the Neutrogena board , and submitted a fairness opinion .
Kenneth Abramowitz , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein , said that because of `` the uncertainties surrounding medical or pharmaceutical products , '' J&J may welcome `` the opportunity to expand their base in consumer products .
'' He noted that the relatively stable , if slower-growing , consumer products are n't much affected by government efforts such as health-care reform or by the pressures of managed care .
A Neutrogena accord does n't preclude J&J from other moves to position itself in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies business , Mr. Abramowitz added .
`` The company has the resources to move on all three fronts , '' he said .
`` Traditionally , they have made a continual stream of acquisitions in consumer products and medical products .
So I would expect that to continue .
'' The J&J spokesman declined to comment on plans for future acquisitions .
Burt Flickinger III , a New York-based consultant at A.T. Kearney Inc. , said he thought Procter & Gamble Co. might have expressed interest in Neutrogena because that consumer-products giant also had much to gain by building up its soap lines -- and by keeping Neutrogena away from a rival such as J&J .
`` Now it 's two global Goliaths squaring off against each other , '' he said .
The move by J&J represents the company saying `` do n't come too close to our turf , or we 'll fight you on other fronts .
'' While $ 35.25 a share `` is way overvalued , '' he said , `` it 's a strategic acquisition , and for that the price is right .
'' Lotus Development Corp. , Cambridge , Mass. , said it shipped its SmartSuite 3.0 , an upgrade of its software suite for use with the Microsoft Corp. 's Windows operating system .
Shipment of the Lotus software had been delayed , contributing to lower-than-expected revenue and earnings in the second quarter .
Desktop software increasingly is sold in such suites , a market led by Microsoft .
Lotus said its SmartSuite 3.0 incorporates updates of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet and other software , and includes a multimedia utility program .
The SmartSuite release has a suggested retail price of $ 795 .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading , Lotus closed yesterday at $ 42.125 , up 31.25 cents .
Novell Inc. is calling a truce with Microsoft Corp. .
Novell 's new chairman and chief executive officer , Robert J. Frankenberg , met last month with Microsoft Chairman William Gates to discuss a mending of ways between the two major software companies .
The talks focused on how to make Microsoft 's personal-computer operating systems work better with Novell 's popular networking software , people familiar with the talks said .
Joint customer service was also a topic .
Detente between Novell and Microsoft could be a boost to customers assembling corporate networks that use technology from both companies .
Under Raymond Noorda , who recently was succeeded as chairman by Mr. Frankenberg , Novell refused to give computer code to Microsoft that would make it easier for programs such as Microsoft 's Windows NT and its forthcoming Chicago operating system to work well with Novell 's NetWare .
Novell also was a major force in encouraging a government antitrust investigation against Microsoft , which was recently concluded by the Justice Department with mild penalties .
Mr. Frankenberg told analysts last week that Novell 's public criticism of Microsoft would cease .
`` As far as Frankenberg 's concerned , that has ended , '' said David Cappuccio , an analyst at Gartner Group who met with Mr. Frankenberg last week .
`` It was totally counterproductive .
'' The talks were held July 7 in Redmond , Wash. , where Microsoft is based .
Disclosure of the discussions comes as Mr. Frankenberg is wrestling with other pressing problems , including the need to cut costs associated with Novell 's purchase of WordPerfect Corp. .
Analysts expect Novell to lay off at least 1,000 workers from the combined company , with some estimates approaching 2,000 .
Novell on Friday said it expects to post fiscal third-quarter earnings tomorrow below analysts ' expectations by 15 % to 20 % , citing higher expenses and lower-than-expected revenue from WordPerfect and the Quattro Pro spreadsheet business it bought from Borland International Inc. .
The company also said it has begun unspecified expense reductions , though a Novell spokeswoman would n't comment on possible layoffs or on the talks with Microsoft .
Novell 's stock price fell 7.4 % yesterday in response to the earnings news .
It closed at $ 14 a share on the Nasdaq Stock Market , down $ 1.125 .
Microsoft closed at $ 54.625 in Nasdaq trading , down 25 cents a share .
The talks with Microsoft were reported in an article in Computerworld yesterday , which cited analysts briefed by Mr. Frankenberg .
They were confirmed by Bob Kruger , Microsoft 's director of strategic relations and standards , who was present at the July meeting .
Many companies already use Microsoft 's DOS or Windows on PCs that are linked by networks managed with NetWare , Novell 's network operating system .
But the two companies also compete directly in some fields .
Microsoft 's Windows NT was designed partly to take business from NetWare , and Novell , Provo , Utah , has sold an operating system that is a clone of DOS .
Disputes between the companies about sharing key information have been common .
`` There has been a significant amount of frustration on both sides with each other , '' a former Novell executive said .
Customers have also become frustrated .
Windows NT still does n't work as well with NetWare as it might , in part because wrangling between Microsoft and Novell led them to separately develop software to make the products communicate .
Microsoft plans to feature built-in support of NetWare in its next version of Windows NT -- and in Chicago , the replacement for DOS and Windows expected early next year , the former Novell executive said .
Microsoft also has given Novell information and code to help it adapt NetWare for Chicago , Mr. Kruger said .
Mr. Frankenberg told Gartner Group analysts that the companies plan to begin sharing information earlier in the software-development process , Mr. Cappuccio said .
But terms of the cooperation have n't been set , though Mr. Frankenberg agreed to meet with Mr. Gates and other top Microsoft officials twice a year .
`` Talking about it is a good thing , '' Mr. Kruger said .
`` But there is no agreement on the table .
'' Mr. Kruger said he believes joint customer service may be a particularly fruitful area for cooperation .
As customers assemble networks that combine the companies ' products , it becomes difficult to identify which software supplier is responsible for a problem .
Cooperation between Microsoft and Novell could address the issue , he said .
Analysts predicted the companies would remain fierce competitors .
Novell , in particular , is expected to resist Microsoft 's attempts to exert the same degree of influence in corporate computer networks as it does in personal computers .
But cooperation in making their products work together could help sales for both companies .
`` That would make a tremendous amount of sense , '' said Richard Edwards , an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co. .
Separately , Novell said that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will re-examine the validity of a patent that is the subject of a long-running lawsuit against Novell .
The company said the patent was granted in 1987 to Roger E. Billings for `` client-server '' computing .
Mr. Billings , who could n't be reached to comment , sued Novell in 1991 in U.S. District Court in San Francisco , alleging that the company infringed on the patent .
NEW YORK -- Another lackluster session was highlighted by a flagging dollar and drooping bonds , but small-company stocks overcame early selling to finish mixed .

Your August 9 , page-one article -LRB- `` Some Mortgage Firms Neglect Black Areas More Than Banks Do '' -RRB- makes frequent reference to PNC Mortgage but virtually ignores the many steps PNC Mortgage has undertaken to become an industry leader in low - and moderate-income mortgage lending .
PNC Bank Corp. has owned Sears Mortgage Co. -LRB- now renamed PNC Mortgage Corp. of America -RRB- for less than nine months .
The article was based on data from 1992 , long before we acquired the company .
PNC Mortgage has taken many significant initiatives to reach out to low - and moderate-income or urban neighborhoods .
These steps include : Opening an inner-city office in Atlanta , with new offices in Chicago and Los Angeles scheduled for next month and an inner-city office in Baltimore to follow ; beginning special initiatives to increase lending to this market segment in Baltimore , Denver and Phoenix ; innovating new mortgage-loan products and policies based on more flexible underwriting criteria ; undertaking marketing efforts directed at low - and moderate-income groups in 15 cities and to the Hispanic community nationwide , and instituting a fair-lending review group to review not only denial recommendations , but cancellations or withdrawals prior to underwriting .
As an independent mortgage company , PNC Mortgage is subject to federal fair-lending laws , but is not subject to the Community Reinvestment Act -LRB- CRA -RRB- requirements under which banks operate .
In keeping with the much more extensive requirements of the CRA , PNC Bank has achieved `` outstanding '' ratings from federal regulatory agencies in its five largest markets -- Pittsburgh , Philadelphia , Cincinnati , Kentucky and Delaware .
We are committed to reaching low-to-moderate-income borrowers in our urban communities .
This commitment will continue despite the disservice done by your article .
LDDS Communications Inc. , continuing an ambitious acquisition spree , agreed to purchase the WilTel long-distance unit of Williams Cos. for a sweetened offer of $ 2.5 billion in cash .
The transaction bolsters LDDS 's position as the country 's fourth-largest long-distance communications company and enhances its ability to compete for large customers with the industry 's Big Three : AT&T Corp. , MCI Communications Corp. and Sprint Corp. .
Also , industry analysts said the combination of LDDS , Jackson , Miss. , and WilTel , Tulsa , Okla. , will create a potentially attractive acquisition target for a wide range of companies seeking to enter the long-distance field .
The acquisition of WilTel , which was expected , gives LDDS an 11,000-mile fiber-optic-cable network , some of it snaked through unused oil and gas pipelines ; the network will fit with LDDS 's nationwide base of mostly small and midsize business customers .
LDDS now offers long-distance services to those customers largely over lines leased from other communications companies .
By transferring much of its existing traffic to WilTel 's network , which now serves both long-distance carriers and large corporate customers , LDDS can reduce its access costs .
These efficiencies , coupled with LDDS 's ability to offer a wider range of products , account for the hefty price tag , according to LDDS .
`` We expect significant operating synergies as a result of combining the operations , '' said Bernard J. Ebbers , president and chief executive officer of LDDS .
On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday , LDDS closed at $ 23.0625 , down 75 cents .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Williams closed unchanged at $ 31.25 .
The WilTel transaction is only the latest in a string of acquisitions that have catapulted LDDS from the ranks of regional long-distance carriers to the big leagues .
Most recently , LDDS agreed earlier this month to acquire satellite carrier IDB Communications Group Inc. for about $ 700 million in stock , a move that extended LDDS 's international capabilities .
Last year , LDDS merged with the long-distance unit of closely held Metromedia Co. , a deal that gave billionaire John W. Kluge the LDDS chairmanship and Metromedia a 20 % ownership stake .
LDDS has been pursuing WilTel since May when LDDS offered $ 2 billion .
But Williams rejected the offer as inadequate while insisting that the unit was n't for sale .
The WilTel sale will leave Williams with plenty of cash to focus again on expanding its traditional line of work -- energy -- while costing the company about one-third of its revenue .
Williams 's businesses comprise natural-gas pipelines , petroleum pipelines , natural-gas gathering and processing , and a group handling an array of smaller , new energy ventures .
Keith Bailey , the company 's chief executive , said Williams expects that , after taxes and transaction-related costs , it will wind up with proceeds of $ 1.6 billion from the WilTel sale and expects to post an after-tax gain of $ 950 million .
`` We have identified a number of investments in the energy area that we are actively pursuing , '' Mr. Bailey said .
Williams 's board also authorized the company to buy back as much as $ 800 million of its own stock during the next 12 months .
Although the planned WilTel sale was n't a surprise , it still reflects an aboutface for Williams .
Mr. Bailey has repeatedly said that telecommunications was growing much faster than any other of Williams 's more staid energy operations .
But in a letter distributed to WilTel 's 2,100 employees yesterday , Roy Wilkens , president and chief executive of the WilTel Network Services unit , wrote , `` Any asset -- no matter how important -- has its price .
'' It was Mr. Wilkens who first came up with the idea of stringing fiber-optic cables through unused Williams pipelines in 1986 and marketing them as free from disruptions .
Through acquisitions , stringing of more lines and leasing , WilTel developed its national telephone network .
WilTel Network Services had an operating profit of $ 48.1 million on revenue of $ 420 million in the first six months of this year .
The acquisition of WilTel will take LDDS to a new level of competition , according to analysts .
Many large companies , which LDDS has only selectively targeted in the past , will feel more comfortable signing up with LDDS once it expands its own hardware , they say .
And with WilTel , LDDS can begin offering a broader menu of services , especially in data transmission .
Just as important , analysts say , the LDDS-WilTel combination creates a long-distance concern that could provide a convenient entry into the business for a number of companies looking for acquisitions .
The Baby Bells , in particular , may gain entry into long-distance for the first time ; Congress is debating legislation that would allow it .
What 's more , information-services concerns , such as Electronic Data Systems Corp. , have considered entering the field .
Talks between EDS and Sprint were held , but later collapsed , earlier this year .
Wall Street rumors , which portrayed EDS and LDDS as close to a merger agreement , sent LDDS stock upward last week .
Afterward , LDDS said it would n't comment on rumors .
EDS said it 's talking to an array of telecommunications concerns but would n't comment on any specific one .
Under terms of the WilTel-LDDS agreement , Williams will retain two smaller portions of WilTel -- an equipment supplier and service company and a subsidiary that operates a video network specializing in transmitting television signals .
LDDS 's original , $ 2 billion offer included those two units .
In the first half of 1994 , the two segments had combined operating profit of $ 6.9 million on revenue of $ 168 million .
Provides long-distance telecommunications primarily for small and midsize businesses nationwide , placing its customers ' traffic on both company-owned and leased lines .
Owns and operates an 11,000-mile national fiber-optic telecommunications system that provides data , voice and video product services .
Atco Ltd. said it is considering spinning off part of Atco Enterprises Inc. , a subsidiary , and is also considering selling some of the subsidiary 's assets .
Atco director William Britton said the Calgary , Alberta , management company 's board has approved in principle both transactions as ways to `` unbundle '' Atco Enterprises ' various businesses .
A committee of Atco directors is assessing the value of the subsidiary 's assets and has n't determined how much of the unit might be spun off to Atco shareholders , he added .
Atco said its is discussing with potential buyers the possible sale of Atco Enterprises ' space-rentals business , which involves the leasing of movable offices , classrooms and other structures in the U.S. and Canada .
Atco Enterprises also makes and supplies relocatable industrial shelters and owns part of a company that provides services to remotely situated airports .
Following a sweeping corporate reorganization in the late 1980s , Atco spun off parts of its electrical and gas utility and its oil and gas production units .
Mr. Britton said the company 's plans for Atco Enterprises are intended to continue this pattern .
American Stores Co. said higher sales and cost-cutting helped boost net income 18 % in the fiscal second quarter .
Earnings rose to $ 69 million , or 48 cents a share , for the quarter ended July 30 , compared with $ 58.5 million , or 41 cents a share , a year earlier .
The Salt Lake City food and drug retailer said revenue fell fractionally to $ 4.67 billion from $ 4.69 billion for the second quarter .
For the six months , American Stores had net income of $ 117 million , or 82 cents a share , on revenue of $ 9.28 billion .
That compared with net income of $ 100 million , or 70 cents a share , on revenue of $ 9.36 billion .
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , American Stores shares closed at $ 24.375 , up 50 cents .
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , citing increased costs for tooling , said it will spend one-third more than expected to build its first U.S. plant .
BMW now will spend as much as $ 800 million over seven years on its plant in Spartanburg , S.C. , said a spokesman for the German maker of luxury automobiles .
That 's up from a previously forecast budget of $ 600 million .
Most of the additional expenditure is to purchase tooling equipment that originally was to have been owned by suppliers , the spokesman said .
BMW said there are long-term cost advantages to owning the equipment .
Production begins next month at the plant .
It will produce 318i sedans at first , and add 325i sedans next year .
Separately , BMW and rival Mercedes-Benz AG , a unit of Daimler-Benz AG , have both denied a report in the Sunday Times of London that said the two were in talks to develop a new luxury car with Vickers PLC , maker of Rolls Royce automobiles .
BMW denied the article 's assertion that it may take a capital stake in Vickers .
CLINTON TOWNSHIP , Mich. -- The board of directors of First Nationwide Bank Corp. said it has `` entered into discussions with a potential acquirer .

First Nationwide Bank has assets of $ 517 million and operates 16 branches in Macomb County , Mich. .
Federal regulators issued a `` Special Fraud Alert '' to warn health-care providers and patients about aggressive and possibly illegal pharmaceutical industry marketing tactics .
The Office of Inspector General at the Health and Human Services Department singled out three types of marketing activity as potential violations of federal antikickback laws .
The programs , which are used increasingly by some big drug companies , involve cash or other payments to physicians or pharmacists to promote specific products .
Patients often are n't aware that their physician or pharmacist is being paid to select a specific drug , according to regulators .
The fraud alert seeks to protect the public `` from companies which encourage health-care providers to put their financial self-interest ahead of the best interest of their patients , '' said June Gibbs Brown , the inspector general .
Such incentives may interfere with a physician 's judgment in determining the most appropriate treatment , she said .
Fraud alerts have been issued infrequently , the last one in 1992 .
But the changes in the pharmaceutical industry , which include new marketing practices as drug companies try new ways to sell their products , are prompting more regulatory review by the inspector general and others , said Lewis Morris , deputy chief counsel for the office .
The agency did n't name specific companies in the fraud alert , in part because the activities are `` typical '' in the industry , said Lisa Foley , the inspector general 's senior counsel .
In one marketing scheme , a drug company pays pharmacies to persuade physicians to change prescriptions from a competing product to its own drug .
Bayer AG 's Miles Inc. is under criminal investigation by the Inspector General 's Office for a program that paid pharmacists to counsel patients about its heart drug , Adalat CC .
Miles has denied wrongdoing .
`` In our opinion , everything we did was truthful and in the best interest of patients , '' a spokesman said .
In another scheme , dubbed by the Inspector General 's Office as the `` frequent flier '' scheme , a drug company awards physicians points toward free airline tickets each time physicians complete paperwork saying they had newly prescibed the company 's drug .
Last year , Ayerst Laboratories Inc. agreed to a settlement in such a program involving some 20,000 physicians .
Although Ayerst , a unit of American Home Products Corp. , denied any liability , it agreed to pay $ 830,000 to settle civil and administrative claims .
In the third scheme , a drug company gives physicians substantial payments as a `` research grant '' for keeping minor records on a prescription drug 's usage , the inspector general 's office said .
Earlier this month , a federal grand jury in Minneapolis charged Caremark International Inc. with participating in a kickback scheme to win millions of dollars for Caremark through payoffs to a Minneapolis doctor , David R. Brown .
The indictment charges that Dr. Brown received hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments from Caremark and Genentech Inc. , disguised as research grants and consulting fees , to prescribe Protropin , a human growth hormone .
Dr. Brown and Caremark , which is a Protropin distributor , were indicted and denied any illegality .
Genentech itself was n't indicted , but an employee was named .
The company expressed support for its employee , who has denied all charges , according to a Genentech spokesman .
The Inspector General 's Office specifically enforces the federal anti-kickback statute that forbids any person or company from paying cash or making in-kind payments to get Medicare or Medicaid business .
The maximum penalty is a $ 25,000 fine per violation , five years in federal prison or both .
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , a trade group , said it has already established guidelines , together with the AMA , that govern the `` proper relationship between physicians and pharmaceutical-industry sales representatives .
'' A spokesman for the PRMA said , `` We do n't know of any major violations of those particular guidelines .
'' But the PRMA will launch today its own initiative to improve awareness of drug-marketing regulations within the industry .
Included in its educational push is a 700-page reference manual that compiles drug-marketing regulations and professional guidelines , according to a PRMA spokesman .
Drug companies have scaled back marketing programs of years past that blatantly lavished physicians with expensive gifts , such as golf weekends at plush resorts , Mr. Morris said .
Companies are using more `` sophisticated ways to get money to doctors , '' such as giving so-called research grants or paying honoraria for speaking engagements , he said .
Mr. Morris notes the agency is also investigating instances of companies giving physicians office equipment , such as laser printers or fax machines , and in some cases , providing physicians with staffers .
The fraud alert `` is n't the last word on drug marketing practices , '' Ms. Foley said .
`` We are aware the industry is going through changes ... and there may be more on the topic .
'' Summer is the time when lots of people get the idea that buying a vacation home would be a great idea .
And it can be -- as long as you do n't consider it an investment .
Sure , there are tax benefits , and you may be able to generate rental income .
If you 're lucky , someday you will be able to sell the house for more than you paid .
But , meanwhile , you have to make those monthly mortgage payments , maintain the property and pay taxes , which can add up to big bucks .
Financial professionals say rental income and tax benefits rarely offset the costs completely .
`` If you want to go to a place that 's yours , a family place that maybe you can pass on , fine , '' says Tim Kochis , a financial planner with Kochis & Fitz in San Francisco .
`` A second home is a psychic investment , not a financial investment .
'' The tax consequences can get complicated if you rent out a vacation home for more than two weeks each year .
It 's generally treated as a second residence if you rent it for fewer than 15 days , as rental property if you use it yourself for fewer than 15 days , or as a combination of both , which requires you to allocate costs according to a specific formula .
A second residence is much like your first as far as the Internal Revenue Service is concerned .
Property taxes and interest on mortgage and other home-related debt up to $ 1.1 million on primary and second residences combined are generally tax deductible .
-LRB- Mortgage interest is n't deductible on additional homes , unless they are rental property .
-RRB- The best deal is that under current law , if you rent out a second home for 14 days or less the income is tax-free ; you do n't even have to declare it on your income-tax return .
But there 's a proposal before Congress to change that and make all rental income taxable .
`` The primary reason you buy a vacation home is because you want to use it , '' says Andrew Blackman , a certified public accountant with the firm Shapiro & Lobell in New York .
`` Tax reasons ... are way down on the list .
'' If your house is used as rental property , you can deduct operating expenses -- such as utilities , maintenance and insurance -- as well as advertising and commissions and depreciation , in addition to property taxes and most of your mortgage interest .
But in most cases , you can use those deductions only to offset rental income , or income from other `` passive '' investments , such as limited partnerships .
You also can carry forward those losses to offset a capital gain when you sell the property .
You can use a rental house yourself for fewer than 15 days or 10 % of the number of days that it 's rented , whichever is greater , and you can spend time there to do repairs and maintenance .
The portion of your mortgage interest allocated to your personal use is considered personal interest and is n't income-tax deductible .
The calculations get even more difficult if your property is part vacation home and part rental property , which is usually the case if you rent it more than two weeks a year and spend more than two weeks there yourself .
A portion of your expenses allocated to renting the property can be used to offset rental income .
Mortgage interest is apportioned between personal residence interest and rental expense .
Property taxes are fully deductible , the portion that is rental expense on Schedule E of Form 1040 and the personal portion on Schedule A of itemized deductions .
But the IRS requires that you take the rental deductions in a certain order and there 's disagreement between the IRS and the tax court over how to calculate the percentage of real-estate taxes and mortgage interest allocated to rental property .
IRS Publication No. 527 , Residential Rental Property -LRB- Including Rental of Vacation Homes -RRB- explains the rules and has work sheets , but you still may want to consult a tax professional .
If you use the tax court 's method , you may risk an audit .
You can switch the tax treatment of a vacation home from year to year .
One year , for instance , it may clearly be rental property .
The next year , it may be used exclusively as a second home that generates no rental income .
Then the next year , it may be used as part vacation home and part rental property .
However the property is used , that is the way you treat it on that year 's tax return .
Some financial professionals question whether it 's worth renting your vacation home at all .
Maintenance and insurance costs will probably be higher than if you just use it yourself .
You 'll have the hassle of finding suitable tenants or have to pay someone to do it for you .
`` Think long and hard about why you 're doing this , '' advises Steven B. Weinstein , national director of personal financial planning for accountants Arthur Andersen & Co. in Chicago .
`` There is an incremental cost .
'' There are some tax breaks , but few owners of second homes are eligible .
If your adjusted gross income is less than $ 100,000 for a couple filing jointly , you may be able to deduct losses on rental real estate up to $ 25,000 .
The loss deduction is phased out completely when a couple 's AGI -- income after some adjustments but before personal exemptions and itemized deductions -- reaches $ 150,000 .
There also may be some benefit for taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax , who would be allowed to take some deductions they otherwise could n't .
There were more tax benefits a decade ago .
Deductions were worth more because the top income tax rate was 50 % , compared with a maximum official rate of 39.6 % now .
Also , rental property previously could be depreciated over 15 years , instead of 27.5 years under current law , and at an accelerated rate , which allowed taxpayers to deduct as much as 15 % of the value of the property in the first year .
Still , any deduction will at least reduce your taxes .
`` If you can generate a profit or at least break even , you have nothing to lose , '' says Douglas Stives , a certified public accountant with the firm Curchin & Co. in Red Bank , N.J. This is probably a good time to buy , too .
After the economic downturn of the early 1990s , vacation-home prices are still low in many parts of the country .
`` It can be a form of forced savings , '' says New York financial planner Lewis J. Altfest .
NEIAFU , Tonga -- This remote and farflung Pacific archipelago has been ruled by royalty for most of its 3,000-year history , the last thousand years by the same family .
Gadfly Akilisi Pohiva would like to change that by curbing the king 's power and promoting democracy , but he knows it will take time .
`` Ten years , 20 years , '' he says .
`` We 're not going to get change overnight .
'' That 's a pretty good bet .
The kingdom 's royal family and 33 nobles are n't very friendly to his ideas .
One of them , a man known only as Luani , thinks Mr. Pohiva is guilty of `` treason '' and does n't know his place .
Sitting on a balcony overlooking one of the prettiest ports in the Pacific , Luani glances at a manservant squatting at his feet and observes that Tongans like to defer to their social betters : `` I try to get him to sit in a chair , but he wo n't .
'' Mr. Pohiva , a 52-year-old former schoolteacher , says he is no radical .
But he has accused King Taufaahau Tupou IV and his nobles of financial legerdemain , and he has called for the formation of a democratic party to run Parliament and share power with the monarch .
`` The king is a dictator , '' he says .
Such talk has gotten Mr. Pohiva elected to Parliament three times since 1987 , and last year five like-minded souls won seats , too .
`` No other person has called the government to account like he has , '' says Kalafi Moala , publisher of the Tonga Times , comparing Mr. Pohiva to Ralph Nader .
`` He 's a zealot for the common people , and he 's become their hero .
'' But the government is entrenched .
Under the 1875 constitution establishing a feudal monarchy , Tongan politics is rigged .
The king appoints 12 ministers -- for-life to the Parliament -LRB- mostly nobles -RRB- .
The nobles elect nine representatives -LRB- always nobles -RRB- .
And the other 96,000 Tongans vote for nine representatives -LRB- in the past , mostly nobles -RRB- .
The king and the nobles also technically own all land .
Mr. Pohiva 's biggest problem , however , is Tongan culture .
Movement of all sorts , democratic and otherwise , is sluggish .
The temperature is typically 80 degrees , the humidity 80 % .
Tonga , just west of the International date line , calls itself the place where time begins .
Culturally and politically , says a diplomat here , `` It 's also the place where time stands still .
'' Open criticism is perhaps the biggest tapu in the nation that gave English the very word taboo .
`` No bad moral habit appears to a native of Tonga more ridiculous , depraved and unjust than publishing the faults of one 's acquaintances and friends , '' observed William Mariner , a British sailor held captive here almost 200 years ago .
`` It is better , they think , to assassinate a man 's person than to attack his reputation .
'' Mr. Pohiva says he is motivated to be un-Tongan by outrage at the lack of political accountability in the kingdom -- and the disparity of wealth .
The king owns a number of estates , including a Victorian mansion with flocks of swans that dominates the waterfront of the capital , Nukualofa .
Less than a mile away , Mr. Pohiva , an intense , wiry man with a toothbrush mustache , lives in a ramshackle house with pigs in the yard .
Mr. Pohiva has felt the social gulf since his teenage years in the provinces .
Orphaned at 13 , he worked as a farmhand to pay for teachers ' college in the capital , then worked in semipoverty as a teacher back in the Tongan boondocks , writing letters to the education ministry complaining about working conditions .
After winning a government scholarship to study in Fiji , he returned to take an obscure post in the education ministry .
Mr. Pohiva got his first crack at influencing public opinion in 1981 .
He was allowed to host a public-affairs show on Radio Tonga , interviewing academics and government officials .
While he says he `` never directly criticized '' the government , Mr. Pohiva says the interviews left `` the impression that the people had no power .
'' He was booted off the air in 1983 , then reinstated on the condition that he stop making speeches about the causes of the French Revolution , oppression of the masses and such .
But a year later , Mr. Pohiva accused ministers of misusing funds , and the government shut down his show .
Then he was fired from his government job .
That motivated him to found an opposition newspaper called the Conch Shell in 1986 , and he has been taking on the king and his nobles ever since .
One of his first attacks was on the king 's practice of selling passports to foreigners , allegedly in violation of Tonga 's citizenship laws .
But being a near-absolute monarch gave the king certain leeway here .
In 1991 , he simply had the passport laws changed .
And he ignored Mr. Pohiva 's demand for an accounting of what became of the $ 27 million supposedly raised by the passport sales .
The Conch Shell later reported that Tongan ministers were taking trips paid for by foreign governments but double-billed to the crown .
It reported that some legislators were doubling their $ 7,100 salaries by claiming two weeks of overtime -LRB- Parliament members put in four-hour days , five months a year , but get a day 's pay for every hour of overtime .
-RRB- Per capita income in Tonga is under $ 600 .
When Mr. Pohiva first won election to Parliament , he began rabble-rousing there , too .
One day in 1990 , Mr. Pohiva rose and complained that the government was full of crooks .
`` They eat money , '' he said in a Tongan phrase that the speaker found rude and insisted Mr. Pohiva take back .
Mr. Pohiva refused , and the speaker threw him out of Parliament for three days for bad manners .
More recently , Mr. Pohiva has castigated the king for letting his daughter , Princess Salote Pilolevu Tuita , set up a private company with rights to launch satellites into orbital slots in space claimed by Tonga .
Last year , Tongasat Ltd. began leasing its place in space to a U.S. concern , Rimsat Ltd. , of Fort Wayne , Ind. .
Mr. Pohiva asserts that most of the profit goes to the princess and her American partners , and just a sliver to Tonga .
The king ignored Mr. Pohiva 's demands for an accounting .
Tonga 's nobles do n't ignore Mr. Pohiva ; they sue him for libel and win .
Mr. Pohiva lost three such suits last year , with judgments against him totaling $ 63,000 .
Lost In one case , he had alleged that Crown Prince Tupoutoa had squandered $ 700,000 of Taiwanese aid on Royal Beer Co. , a private venture .
In another , he had accused four executives of a struggling squash-growing cooperative of paying themselves $ 2,000 each out of the co-op 's account .
Judges in the cases declined to force his accusers to produce financial records Mr. Pohiva feels would have proved the truth of what he had said .
To pay the judgments , he had to pull his son out of college in Fiji and , he says , he has raised thousands of dollars among Tongan expatriates in the U.S. Supporters in Tonga have started a legal defense fund .
Mr. Pohiva says he is now back in semipoverty .
His political prospects do n't look too good , either .
The pro-democracy contingent 's proposals are regularly voted down in Parliament or utterly disregarded .
And though Mr. Pohiva and his friends have drafted a platform for their prospective new democratic party , they do n't plan to field any candidates until 1999 , to give the idea time to sink in .
The health-care debate is now entering its final phase , with Congress preparing to make a decision about which , if any , reform plan to pass .
Television journalists long ago cut the amount of airtime they were giving to the policy substance of this issue , focusing their attention instead on political gamesmanship .
In a study recently published in the Media Research Center 's `` MediaNomics '' newsletter , analysts looked at every story on the networks ' evening newscasts from June 15 to July 15 .
Out of 68 reports on health care reform , 56 focused on the political aspects .
The 12 policy stories featured a curious spin .
Nine examined the possible economic effects of the health care proposals , while three focused on patients in a financial bind because of health-care problems .
None featured what would happen to individuals representing the 80 % of the public who are satisfied with their current health care arrangements .
Business has played a crucial role in arguing for and against various proposals , yet out of 208 people interviewed during this one-month period , only 16 were businessmen -LRB- six of them were supporters of employer mandates -RRB- .
The major networks instead chose to focus on politicians , yet here again the numbers were skewed .
Out of 141 political officials , Democrats supporting national health care outnumbered Republicans opposing it by 102 to 39 .
Surely the medical community could have instructive things to say about health care reform -- if only it were asked .
NBC featured seven interviews with doctors ; CBS had one ; ABC and CNN , none .
And what about the insurance industry , generally typecast as the villains in this whole thing ?
Their representatives were interviewed by NBC seven times ; ABC and CNN each had one ; CBS ignored them altogether .
While the `` NBC Nightly News '' was by far the most diverse in interview selection , ABC 's `` World News Tonight '' was just awful .
It aired 18 stories focusing on the politics of the issue , none on its economic ramifications -LRB- though it did run one feature dealing with problems in existing government-run programs -RRB- .
It aired 55 soundbites from politicians -LRB- 40 were Democrats -RRB- ; and only two from businessmen , both brought to Washington by the Clintons to promote employer mandates .
The Mitchell bill has dominated the health-care debate for the past several weeks , even though it 's been missing its most important element -- a price tag .
Incredibly , in the dozens of network evening news reports in the week after it was introduced on Aug. 2 , not one focused on the fact that no one had any idea what the Mitchell plan meant in terms of costs .
On Aug. 10 , the Congressional Budget Office released its preliminary report on the Mitchell plan .
Among other things , the report questioned the feasibility of many major components of the package , and warned that Congress was rushing to impose a system that could n't be implemented .
How did the networks react ?
NBC 's Lisa Myers devoted a major portion of her Aug. 10 story to the CBO bombshell .
Over at ABC , John Cochran reported that it was `` damaging '' to Sen. Mitchell but cited only one aspect , the CBO 's contention that mandates could not be applied efficiently ; the next day he mentioned the report 's conclusion that subsidies would be hard to administer for low-income people .
At CBS , Dan Rather opened his broadcast with news of `` what could be an important shot in the arm '' for the Democrats -- the Mitchell plan 's endorsement by the seniors ' lobby .
Buried at the end of the story was a mention of the CBO report .
CNN 's Jeff Levine had an even stranger take , concluding that the CBO report was politically `` an important plus for Sen. Mitchell .
'' Within 24 hours , the CBO report was forgotten altogether .
The journalists also have spent more time analyzing advertising than the policy substance .
Reporters , so pleased with their highly publicized ad-watch patrols in the 1992 presidential campaign , are at it again .
No advertising campaign has come under more fire than the `` Harry and Louise '' spots aired by the Health Insurance Association of America .
When the first commercial aired a year ago , `` CBS This Morning '' brought on Ron Pollack of Families USA to denounce it as `` unethical to the worst degree .
'' CBS did not mention that Families USA is lobbying for the Clinton plan .
Aside from the usual concerns of bias in the media , television coverage of the health care debate illustrates an interesting pattern .
There is early coverage of the horror stories that are the impetus for the legislation .
But then the journalists ' interest shifts quickly to the political gamesmanship .
Lost in the middle is reporting on whether the various reform plans will actually work .
This could be disastrous on an issue as huge as health care .
If health care legislation goes wrong , then the perverse consequences will be so massive that even Washington television reporters may be forced to cover the substance .
Mr. Bozell is chairman of the Media Research Center in Alexandria , Va. .
HANGZHOU , China -- Social programs are a hot topic in China these days , reflecting the country 's fatigue with its huge welfare burden .
While economic liberalization has spawned a thriving private sector , the state remains the lifetime provider of free or heavily subsidized benefits to 70 % of the nation 's 147 million nonfarm workers .
These benefits , provided by work units , include not just housing and medical care but also schools and even cinemas .
The result : inefficient state firms struggling to cover costs unrelated to production .
The welfare problem is so daunting that China has asked outsiders for help .
The World Bank recently approved $ 350 million in loans and credits to build housing for sale to state employees .
Until now , such housing reform had been tried only on a small scale .
Foreign insurance companies , whose role in China is now tightly restricted , also may play a role in welfare reform .
Beijing has indicated it may ease those restrictions to encourage competition and entice workers to buy their own policies to cover medical and other risks .
What little has been done to date , though , provides only minor relief for China 's beleaguered state firms , about 60 % of which are believed to be incurring losses , which must be covered by the state .
Beijing has threatened from time to time to clean up the mess by letting the moneylosers go bankrupt .
But so far , this has been more talk than action .
While the central government dithers , some local officials and factory managers are increasingly critical of the system .
To Zhang Mingguang , vice mayor of Hangzhou , a city of two million people on China 's east coast , the country 's health care , which requires users to pay little or nothing , offers proof enough that the system cries out for reform .
`` Ours is a system that hands out medication to perfectly healthy people and prescribes huge overdoses to patients who are only slightly sick , '' the vice mayor declares .
Seated beside him , Zhang Yunggao , an economic planner for Zhejiang , the province that encompasses Hangzhou , nods in agreement .
`` People do n't think about it because the money does n't come directly out of their own pockets , but it has to come from somewhere , '' he says .
Direct Subsidies And it adds up .
The central government disclosed this month that direct subsidies to the state sector last year soaked up 72 billion yuan -LRB- $ 8.3 billion -RRB- , or 16 % of Beijing 's total revenue .
That sum covers only handouts to prop up ailing state companies and to pay for workers ' cost-of-living increases ; it is but a fraction of the welfare state 's full costs , which are dispersed throughout the government budget .
The line for handouts may well stretch even longer this year .
Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said this month that many state enterprises are so starved for cash they have been deferring salary payments until later this year .
He emphasized the need to create properly funded social programs to ease the welfare burden borne by state companies .
Some Chinese officials see a partial solution in companies such as Kaidi Silk Co. , a fabric and garment manufacturer majority-owned by the city of Hangzhou .
Workers , rice bowls in hand , stand watch over a machine that prints Donald Duck and other Walt Disney Co. cartoon characters on fabric for export .
Given generous incentives , the workers have opted to work through their lunch hour .
Kaidi , which is highly profitable , pays its workers above-average wages .
They parcel some of their rising incomes into pension funds and medical insurance , and buy their own homes , all of which used to be provided either free or at nominal cost by the state .
Kaidi 's record also means that it has had no trouble selling minority stakes to employees and foreign investors .
With the money thus raised , it has taken over an ailing competitor -- and responsibility for its hundreds of workers .
`` We got some prime real estate .
We also took over the obligation to provide housing to these workers , '' says Yang Bingfang , Kaidi 's chairman and general manager .
But he is confident the company can unload the burden .
`` We aim to make them homeowners in the long run , '' Mr. Yang says .
`` We 'll do it even if it means lending them the money .
'' Ideally , if China had enough model enteprises like Kaidi , they could take over all the loss-ridden companies and lead the country in a transition away from the welfare state .
But success stories like Kaidi are rare , so the central government must attack the mess piecemeal .
Reform-minded officials acknowledge that Beijing will have to examine the system of perks and throw out nonessential items .
In the welfare state of the future , no one would get free skating rinks or free rides in state-run amusement parks .
Nor , in theory , would anyone go without basics such as housing and medical care .
`` In the long run , we should have a system where the costs would be shared among the workers , the enterprises and the state , '' says Wang Qipei , a former government planner who is now overseeing construction of Nanjing 's new airport .
One of the most ambitious proposals is for a national pension fund to replace the existing system , which now neither earmarks any money for this purpose nor requires contributions from anyone .
When they retire , workers continue to draw as much as 100 % of their pay from their work units .
The central government has already directed some wealthier state companies in selected cities to convert their employees from renters into homeowners .
The exercise requires the companies to build homes and sell them at affordable prices .
But without a mature property market , the pricing can be haphazard .
`` The boss goes to a worker and says , ` How about 20,000 yuan for this apartment ?
' '' says Rocky Shao , an executive with a securities firm in Shenzhen , across the border from Hong Kong .
`` If the worker does n't object , the boss will say , ` How about 30,000 ?
' If the worker jumps up and protests , the boss will back off and say , ` OK , OK , so how about 25,000 ?
' The price basically is determined by how violently the potential buyer reacts .
'' TOKYO -- For an encouraging story in the discouraging world of bonds , consider Japan .
Large Japanese investors are inching back toward their government 's bonds , which have tumbled this year .
Fueled by the yen 's recent strength against the dollar , their buying has helped bring down the yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese bond to 4.6 % from 4.64 % a week ago .
It is probably a short-term play .
That 's because any economic recovery , including the one many analysts expect for Japan , will inevitably breathe life into the bond market 's mortal enemy , inflation .
Interest rates begin rising to keep pace , and bond prices , which move in the opposite direction , start weakening .
But for now , some foreign investors believe the bonds of Japan may have more momentum in coming months than Japanese stocks .
The bonds have been hard-hit by rising world-wide interest rates and the prospect of a Japanese government deficit .
Some analysts believe bond prices are near a bottom , with yields likely to stay on a plateau at least for a few months .
Salomon Brothers Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. both dimmed their views of Japan 's stock market this month .
Morgan Stanley last week reduced its weighting in Japanese stocks to 20 % of a global-stock portfolio from 30 % , in favor of shares in Europe , the U.S. and emerging markets .
Salomon earlier had cut its weighting in Japanese stocks to 28 % of a global-equity portfolio from 35 % , in favor of European and emerging markets .
Meanwhile , Japan 's insurers , banks and mutual funds -- all hurt by a four-year bear market in Japanese stocks -- now are earmarking piles of cash for Japanese government bonds .
Japanese fund managers say their government 's paper poses no foreign-exchange risk to yen-based investors , offers better yields than Japan 's stock market , and has less credit risk than the corporate loans that institutions here often underwrite .
To be sure , Japanese government bonds are packed with potential problems for a global investor .
If the yen slips from its current highs against the dollar , as some economists predict , dollar-based investors would have to swallow a currency loss .
And the prospects of a growing government deficit this year threaten to raise yields further .
Already , such concerns have fueled a jump in yields from 4.1 % a year ago .
But a visit to Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. shows the pressures that are driving some Japanese institutions to support the bond market .
Like other insurers , Sumitomo Life is having an increasingly tough time funding fixed-rate payments to policyholders guaranteed between 4 % and 5 % a year , says Tomonari Kadoumi , a manager in the company 's bond-investment section .
Falling stock prices have decimated its equity portfolio and the strong yen makes foreign investments risky .
Government bonds , on the other hand , now yield almost exactly the same rate Sumitomo owes to many of its policyholders .
So the firm bought government bonds heavily between April and June -- they now account for 15 % of the roughly $ 208 billion it has under management -- and it is ready to buy more bonds if yields rise above 5 % .
Compared with other possible investments , Mr. Kadoumi says , `` Japanese government bonds are safe and good .
'' Recently , Japanese investors have curbed their investments abroad , stung by turbulence in many world markets and by the rising yen , which hurt the value of their non-yen investments .
A senior officer at another major Japanese life insurer says his firm currently is buying government bonds with money it might otherwise have lent to corporations .
With Japan 's prime lending rate at only 4.7 % , loans earn little more than government bonds , he explains , despite their greater credit risk .
Japan 's banks face similar pressures , says Mikio Fujii , an officer in the bond-sales department at Nomura Securities Co. .
Demand for corporate loans is so weak , he explains , that banks `` have to invest in other sectors .
'' And Nomura Investment Management Co. currently is `` looking at the bond market very closely , '' says Nobumitsu Kagami , chairman of its investment policy committee .
Japanese government bonds may be worth holding for about three months , he says .
Yields on Japanese government bonds are `` completely out of sync with reality , '' says Cameron Umetsu , bond analyst at UBS Securities Ltd. .
Unlike in the U.S. , where bond yields are rising because of inflation fears , `` in Japan , deflation is the story , '' he says .
Japan 's consumer price index rose less than 1 % in June from the year-earlier level , and Mr. Umetsu expects Tokyo 's CPI to fall 0.7 % this month from its August 1993 level .
`` September is the turning-point month '' for bonds , he concludes .
The Bank of Japan 's closely watched Tankan economic survey , set for release Sept. 6 , and the monthly measure of Japan 's gross domestic product will reveal any indications of inflation .
And without clear signs of inflation , he concludes , the Bank of Japan is unlikely to raise its official discount rate .
Economists at Salomon Brothers ' Tokyo office say bond yields wo n't necessarily rise if the government spends more to stimulate the economy .
Bond yields fell during a period of quickening bond supply between 1988 and 1993 , they wrote to clients last week , because demand for bonds was strong .
And a growing portion of the government 's budget is likely to be funded by increased tax revenue -- not from bond sales at all .
Japanese government-bond yields should fall `` toward '' 4.3 % in coming months , a report says .
Catching any wave of bond buying by big Japanese institutions could be tricky .
Tokio Marine & Fire Insurance Co. is waiting for government-bond yields to hit 5 % , says Tadashi Tominaga , a bond portfolio manager there .
`` It 's quite attractive now , '' he says , `` but you do n't have to rush .
'' The Congressional leadership and Democrats more generally have one purpose -- proving they can `` end gridlock '' so they can run in the fall elections on the mantra `` We can govern .
'' They 're now patting themselves on the back for getting the House to pass something that can be labeled a crime bill , and hoping to do the same for something that can be labeled a health bill .
Predictably , we suppose , Congress is actually making a spectacle of itself .
In the ides of August , the House conducted a 36-hour marathon and waived most of its own rules to rewrite the conference report that rewrote the House and Senate crime bills .
The Senate , meanwhile , is under Baseball Commissioner George Mitchell 's threat of all-night sessions while the Chafee Bill , the Mitchell Bill and the Clinton Bill play musical chairs to decide what to do with one-seventh of national output and your next doctor 's visit .
If this is governing , what is anarchy ?
The crime bill was supposed to be a done thing , remember , until a majority of the House decided it could n't stomach the monstrosity disgorged by the Senate-House conference committee .
For starters , with a House bill calling for $ 27 billion in spending and a Senate bill at $ 22 billion , the committee `` compromised '' at $ 33.5 billion .
However , the bill set aside only $ 30.2 billion in a special trust fund , supposedly to be financed by savings through Vice President Gore 's `` reinventing government '' proposals .
The current bill still appropriates $ 30.2 billion ; the `` cuts '' that persuaded 46 Republicans to bail out the leadership were mostly in phantom budget authorizations .
Some of the more egregious pork-barrel projects were sacrificed , but a great many are still hidden in the text few members have even read -LRB- see table -RRB- .
The only way House leaders could sneak this whopper into law was to ignore every conceivable rule governing budget votes .
One rule requires that Members have three legislative days to read a final bill -- waived .
Another allows Members to raise points of order against sections of the bill that have nothing to do with its purpose -- waived .
After amending an eight-inch thick conference report in less than 36 hours , House conferees stumbled out with a new bill at 3 a.m. on Sunday , counting on sheer exhaustion to get it passed on the House floor .
Rep. Don Manzullo of Illinois , a GOP freshman who had actually read the entire first conference report , asked to see the text of the changes .
Only four copies existed , but the Rules Committee allowed him to peek at one .
`` The report was 450 pages long , and the changes were sheets of paper inserted into it along with handwritten notes , '' he told us .
`` It looked like a school exercise book .
'' Perhaps the Senate , where procedural rules tend to mean something , will save the country from a bill that is in itself indictable as budgetary fraud .
Yet Congressional and administration leaders are banking on a similar 11th-hour dynamic to force through a health care bill .
The bill engineered by Hillary Clinton and Ira Magaziner was left standing when the music stopped ; indeed , its two architects may appear in court next month to explain how it was secretly prepared in possible violation of open-meeting laws .
Majority Leader George Mitchell 's bill , a version of the Clinton plan without that dreaded label attached , has been left standing without a chair .
Still marching with the music playing are Senators describing themselves as `` mainstream .
'' -LRB- This month 's Newsweek poll finds that only 31 % of the public wants a health care bill this year , while 65 % would prefer to wait until next year .

WASHINGTON -- Chevy Chase Federal Savings Bank reached an $ 11 million agreement to settle government charges that it failed to offer mortgages and other services to qualified black residents in the Washington , D.C. , area .
In a civil suit filed in the federal district court here , the Justice Department accused Chevy Chase Federal and its subsidiary B.F. Saul Mortgage Co. of discriminating against black neighborhoods in soliciting business , in its branch structure and in its commission system for loan originators .
This case marks the first time the Justice Department has brought a racial-discrimination suit against a lender for its marketing practices .
Past cases of discrimination have focused on the treatment of loan applications .
Chevy Chase Federal , which is based in Chevy Chase , Md. , is the largest savings-and-loan institution in the Washington area .
The Justice Department said the company had n't opened any branches in census tracts with a majority of black residents , which account for 90 % of the district 's African-American population .
The thrift also had n't opened any branches in black areas of Prince George 's County , Md. , even though nearly 40 % of all black households in the county earn more than $ 50,000 a year -- creating the smallest disparity in income between blacks and whites in the nation .
Since the Justice Department 's investigation began last year , the lenders have opened three branches and two mortgage offices in previously redlined areas .
Under the settlement , the company will open three mortgage offices and at least one branch in black areas of Washington .
The company agreed to advertise its services with real-estate agents who serve black areas .
Chevy Chase Federal also will recruit more blacks for loan agent positions and train its existing loan staff in fair marketing practices .
At least $ 7 million of the settlement will be set aside to cover the costs of a special loan program .
Residents in redlined areas will be eligible for home loans at a discounted interest rate plus a grant equaling 2 % of the down payment .
The program will provide an estimated $ 140 million in loans available to the communities .
Chevy Chase Federal can use the remaining $ 4 million as it chooses , either by opening new branches and mortgage offices or expanding the special loan program .
B. Francis Saul II , chairman of Chevy Chase Federal , said the company agreed to the settlement out of its `` strong commitment '' to the community .
`` While we adamantly deny all the allegations , the relief sought by the department asks for lending and banking services for those who most need them , '' he said in a written statement .
Attorney General Janet Reno said Chevy Chase 's allegedly discriminatory practices were `` like placing potholes on the road to prosperity '' and added that with this settlement , `` the road has been repaved .
'' RALEIGH , N.C. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- The British drug maker Glaxo Holdings PLC has agreed to put a warning on the labels of its migraine remedy Imitrex , telling about a woman who died shortly after getting an injection of the drug .
Glaxo agreed to the label revision after a recent request from the Food and Drug Administration , even though the death of Dianne D. Riley of Kansas City , Mo. , has n't been positively linked to Imitrex , an FDA spokesman said .
Doctors may continue to prescribe the drug as they see fit , he said .
Imitrex `` has been widely used and we 're very confident in the safety profile of the drug , '' a spokeswoman at Glaxo 's U.S. headquarters in Research Triangle Park , N.C. , said .
`` What these labeling changes are to do is make sure the physician has appropriate information to make sure and prescribe appropriately , '' she said .
Ms. Riley , 41 , began having reactions to Imitrex about seven minutes after her doctor injected her with the drug , the labeling will say .
She died after developing heart problems .
The warning will also say Ms. Riley had a history of heart disease , asthma and an allergy to codeine .
The label will warn doctors against prescribing the drug to people with heart disease .
WASHINGTON -- A Resolution Trust Corp. investigator made new allegations that RTC officials in Washington tried to quash a regional office 's inquiry into Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan .
The allegations were contained in a letter from the attorney for Richard Iorio , a criminal-investigations supervisor in the RTC 's office in Kansas City , Mo. .
Mr. Iorio and two other investigators , who have issued 10 criminal referrals in the Madison Guaranty case , were placed on administrative leave last week while the agency 's Human Resources Management Group looks into questions of `` compliance with RTC policies and procedures .
'' In a letter to acting RTC chief Jack Ryan , the attorney , Joseph Bocock , asked that the compliance inquiry be turned over to the RTC 's inspector general .
Mr. Bocock said the RTC inspector general usually investigates allegations of wrongdoing by agency officials .
The Human Resources Management Group is controlled by `` key RTC management , '' he said , raising questions as to the impartiality of the personnel group 's findings .
Mr. Bocock also said that the agency 's Aug. 15 decision to put the three Kansas City investigators on administrative leave would prevent their continued assistance in several investigations by an independent counsel and others regarding Madison Guaranty and Whitewater Development Corp. .
The former owner of Madison Guaranty was a partner of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton in Whitewater .
In the letter to Mr. Ryan , Mr. Bocock said that Mr. Iorio and his staff were warned `` as early as '' Feb. 18 of this year that `` certain key RTC managers would take a ` dim view ' of his office 's investigation of Madison Guaranty .
'' But Mr. Bocock said the office nevertheless pushed forward with the probe `` to protect the public trust .
'' He said , `` These efforts must not be jeopardized by the very real possibility that the RTC will not independently conduct the current investigation .
'' Mr. Bocock expressed Mr. Iorio 's concern that the RTC investigation of the three officials involves `` a program of retribution '' by politically motivated RTC managers .
RTC spokesman Stephen Katsanos said the agency has made `` no allegations of wrongdoing '' by the three investigators .
He said he doubts that their absence from duty `` for this brief period '' will affect the RTC 's civil investigation into Madison Guaranty or the criminal referrals that the three officials had made .
A letter from the RTC to Mr. Iorio said the leave will last two weeks .
Mr. Katsanos also said the RTC inspector general is n't asked to investigate personnel performance unless there is first a determination that the inspector general needs to make such an analysis .
In a recent House Banking Committee hearing , April Breslaw , a Washington-based RTC attorney handling the civil investigation of Madison Guaranty , said that when she visited the Kansas City office she had been trapped into an informal discussion on Feb. 2 with Jean Lewis , the Kansas City investigator who wrote the criminal referrals .
Ms. Breslaw has been quoted as saying in that conversation , which was tape-recorded without her knowledge , that top RTC officials would like to be able to conclude that Whitewater 's financial troubles did n't cause any Madison losses .
Ms. Breslaw told the House panel that her comment to Ms. Lewis included a caveat that RTC officials wanted a favorable outcome only `` if they could say it honestly .
'' Ms. Lewis , who is supervised by Mr. Iorio , and Lee Ausen , who oversees both Ms. Lewis and Mr. Iorio , were the other officials placed on administrative leave .
A lawyer for Ms. Lewis and Mr. Ausen said they have n't decided whether to ask that the inspector general investigate the matter .
Mr. Iorio had asked to testify at the House panel 's Whitewater hearing , but was told by the RTC 's senior counsel for legal services that the committee had n't asked for testimony by additional RTC employees and that such testimony was `` unnecessary .
'' MGI Properties said it sold its Minneapolis industrial properties for $ 14.9 million , resulting in a gain of $ 2.7 million , or 24 cents a share , to be reported for the third quarter , ending Aug. 31 .
For the third quarter ended Aug. 31 , 1993 , MGI earned $ 1.9 million , or 17 cents a share .
The real estate investment trust did n't identify the purchaser of the Minneapolis properties , but said it was a national pension adviser .
MGI said in Boston that it intends to reinvest proceeds from the sale in properties that it `` believes will provide greater income growth and capital appreciation opportunities .
'' There 's nothing like a good old View-Master to turn around a bad-luck streak .
Misfortune and soaring costs recently prompted 32-year-old New York fashion designer Marcos Ergas to steer clear of runway shows .
Instead , Mr. Ergas mailed 800 View-Master 3-D Viewers to retailers , buyers and the media , inviting them to review his 1995 men 's spring collection `` at their leisure ... in the bathtub '' or `` on the Stairmaster .
'' The venerable Tyco Toys Inc. gadget -LRB- around since 1939 -RRB- contains seven slides of a model wearing Mr. Ergas 's designer sportswear .
Certainly Mr. Ergas could use a change of fortune .
His notorious streak of bad luck ranges from models slipping and spraining their ankles to his media spokesman losing his voice at a crucial news conference .
One of his most bizarre accidents involved a fire in his showroom last fall that left his entire shirt collection speckled with `` burnt details '' on the collars , cuffs and edges .
Currently , the shirts retail for about $ 135 in some trendier menswear stores .
In addition to dodging disaster and the `` hoopla '' of fashion shows , Mr. Ergas says he 's saving a small fortune .
The toy showcase , `` Run-A-Way With A View , '' cost around $ 17,000 to arrange with Mount Laurel , N.J.-based Tyco Toys and to mail , compared with about $ 80,000 he typically spends for a fashion show .
The idea has roused laughs and curiosity .
But buyers insist they 're not giving up the excitement of the fashion show .
Christopher Spieker , a buyer for Bergdorf Goodman in New York , says the `` whole office was laughing '' when they saw the View-Master , but he enjoys seeing the entire collection at a show .
`` The View-Master is a bit of a fun gag but you ca n't see the clothes upfront , '' he says .
Buyers from Alex Forma of Portland , Ore. , `` thought it was really cute ... But honestly , we have n't said ` we have to spend $ 10,000 on Marcos just because he sent a View-Master , ' '' says co-owner Todd Slenning .
The View-Master is a `` great idea , but the shows really get our creative juices flowing , '' adds David Goldman , owner of Boys ' Co. of Vancouver , British Columbia .
Mr. Ergas says the View-Master performances have helped him win four new accounts .
As for future shows , he plans to send out an additional 700 toys for his women 's collection next month .
WASHINGTON -- Nuclear weapons can be made with smaller amounts of plutonium and enriched uranium than the International Atomic Energy Agency has established as the benchmarks for its inspections , a spokesman for the IAEA acknowledged .
Responding to a Washington-based environmental group 's claim that the agency 's estimates were `` totally out of line with reality , '' the IAEA spokesman , David Kyd , said the agency has known for some time that the estimates were too high .
`` We are in the hands of our member states , '' he explained .
`` They set the benchmarks .
'' Thomas B. Cochran , a physicist with the Natural Resources Defense Council , asserted yesterday that the IAEA 's standards may overstate the amount of weapons materials needed to make nuclear bombs by as much as eight times and that recent quantities being smuggled out of Russia into Germany are `` bumping up against '' the real thresholds for making small nuclear weapons .
At a news conference held by the council , Dr. Cochran charged that while the IAEA estimates that it requires 8 kilograms , 17.6 pounds , of plutonium -- a heavy , leadlike material -- to make a bomb , his calculations showed it would require only one to three kilograms , or 2.2 to 6.6 pounds .
The resulting weapon , he said , could devastate a 40-block area in a major city .
Dr. Cochran asserted that the use of higher threshold levels by the IAEA and public officials in the U. SS and Japan seriously underestimates the danger of bomb materials being smuggled out of Russia , the size of North Korea 's clandestine arsenal and the risk presented by plutonium that is missing from a nuclear processing facility in Japan .
With a high degree of sophistication , he said , a nuclear weapon could be made with a chunk of plutonium no bigger than a cigarette package .
`` It is true that in weapons-sophisticated countries you can do it make a bomb with less , '' said the IAEA 's Mr. Kyd , but he said the 121 nations that make up the IAEA prefer the higher standards partly because setting the agency 's inspection standards to the lower level would make its costs of inspection `` substantially more .
'' `` If you want to drive the threshold down , the price would go up , '' he explained , estimating that the $ 68 million that the agency spends annually to inspect nuclear facilities could easily double if it were forced to account for cumulative losses at lower levels .
The agency currently has 200 inspectors looking at some 1,000 nuclear facilities in 60 countries , most of them nonnuclear weapons states .
The Pentagon had no immediate comment on Mr. Cochran 's statement .
The U.S. Energy Department , which makes nuclear weapons , recently lowered its estimate of the amount of plutonium required for a small nuclear weapon to 4 kilograms , or 8.8 pounds .
Dr. Cochran said the disparity between the public figures and the real amounts of plutonium and highly enriched uranium needed to make bombs has been known within the nation 's defense community since the early '50s .
Ted Taylor , a former bomb designer at Los Alamos , N.M. , lauded the Natural Resources Defense Council for `` performing a public service '' by disclosing the lower numbers .
But Carson Mark , who headed the nation 's nuclear-weapons design laboratory at Los Alamos between 1950 and 1970 , vehemently disagreed .
He asserted that while sophisticated bomb designers could make weapons with less material , it was n't clear that terrorist groups could .
Announcing a lower standard , he said , would be a `` self-deluding mistake .
'' Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said she has asked her experts to review the issue raised by the council .
In a statement , she said she plans `` to move forward quickly to open a dialogue '' on the issue of what amounts of plutonium and uranium must be safeguarded to meet the nation 's nonproliferation goals .
MILWAUKEE -- Firstar Corp. said it agreed to acquire Investors Bank Corp. in a stock swap currently valued at $ 101.9 million .
Under the terms of the definitive pact , Firstar , a bank holding company with $ 14 billion in assets , will exchange 0.8676 share of its common stock for each of Investors Bank 's 3.7 million shares outstanding .
Investors Bank , based in Wayzata , Minn. , has assets of $ 1 billion .
In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , Firstar common closed at $ 31.75 , down 37.5 cents .
Based on that price , Investors Bank holders will receive $ 27.55 of Firstar stock for each of its shares , for a total of $ 101.9 million .
On the Nasdaq Stock Market , Investors Bank shares closed at $ 24.625 , up 12.5 cents .
Upon closing , holders of Investors Bank preferred stock will receive a cash payment of $ 27.50 a share , for a total of $ 8.4 million .
Firstar said the transaction will double the asset size of its Minnesota bank and give it access to new markets in the Twin Cities .
The transaction is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 1995 , subject to approval by regulators and Investors Bank shareholders .
TOSCO Corp. -LRB- Stamford , Conn. -RRB- -- Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group placed this independent refiner and marketer 's double-B-plus senior secured debt and its double-Bminus preferred-stock rating on Credit Watch with positive implications .
Total debt outstanding is about $ 610 million .
The rating concern said the move reflects , in part , the company 's ability to transform itself from a single-asset refiner to a large U.S. refining and marketing company through its acquisitions since April 1993 .
Tosco , S&P said , has aggressively expanded its asset base , and additional acquisitions remain a high probability , particularly in the retail business .
JAPANESE TOURISTS are having a ball -- by traveling in costume .
Masquerade tours are the latest rage in Japan .
Tokyoites are paying 11,300 yen -LRB- $ 115 -RRB- for the Hato Bus `` Dress Up Tokyo '' tour , which includes stops at fancy hotels and an expensive gown to wear .
Participants -- all female , Hato stresses -- don frothy wedding dresses or slinky cocktail get-ups .
More traditional outfits are also in .
A number of companies offer a glimpse into the life of Japan 's maiko , or apprentice geisha .
Tours take travelers to the former imperial capital of Kyoto for a night at a Japanese-style inn , where customers don the resplendent kimonos and makeup of the traditional courtesans .
Prices , however , are strictly modern : Kinki Nippon Tourist sells one such tour for about 50,000 yen .
For slightly less , the Hotel Gimmond in Kyoto offers a similar package that lets women -- some in their 80s -- travel in geisha costume to crowded tourist spots .
And for 3,500 yen , the Madonna Tei coffee shop in the ancient city of Kamakura serves up a traditional meal from Japan 's Meiji era -LRB- 1868-1911 -RRB- to customers wearing 19th-century school uniforms .
`` Japanese are really foreigners to their own country .
They grow up on foreign-style food and in foreign-style buildings , '' says Madonna Tei spokesman Kensei Iwata .
But during the economic slowdown , he says , many realized `` there are some things that should n't be left behind .
'' The glamour is also a draw : A Hotel Gimmond spokesman says his maiko guests only really get their money 's worth when tourists `` take them for real maiko and take their pictures .
Then these women can feel a little bit of what it 's like to be a star .
'' RECESSION-STUNG hotels in Japan are going to even greater lengths to attract customers , particularly during the sluggish summer season .
Wataya Besso , a traditional inn in Kyushu , in July ran a two-week campaign allowing guests to stay at special rates -- of their choosing .
The campaign let some guests pay as they pleased for rooms that normally start at 20,000 yen per person .
A spokesman declined to discuss how much revenue the program brought in .
Some of the freestyle bills were `` well under '' what the hotel normally charges , he says .
But some customers willingly paid the hotel 's listed prices .
Whatever the bottom line , the venture was a profitable promotional endeavor : `` People certainly talked about it , '' the spokesman says .
Not surprisingly , it proved most popular among the elderly : More than half the participants were in their 60s , 70s or 80s and reaped discounts of 60 % to 80 % .
In February , a centenarian snapped up the chance to stay for free .
`` We did n't really expect that , '' admits a spokeswoman .
`` There are n't that many people of that age around .
'' Such promotions are cropping up as hotels across Japan rush to cut prices to lure Japanese tourists who are otherwise flocking overseas .
Hitoshi Kamimura , of the Japan National Tourist Organization , says prices at many hotels have dropped by 20 % or more this year .
Hotels `` are trying to change their image so that Japanese will travel in their own country , '' he says .
AS THE STRONG YEN drives Japanese tourists abroad , it 's no surprise that gaijin , or foreigners , are opting for cheaper destinations than Japan .
The number of foreign tourists entering Japan between January and March fell to 414,760 , a 7.4 % drop from a year earlier , according to a recent Japan National Tourist Organization report .
That 's in sharp contrast to the 2.7 million Japanese tourists -- a 16 % increase on the year -- who traveled overseas during the period .
The number of American tourists fell 2 % from a year earlier .
Declines have been even bigger for tourists from other parts of Asia , where currencies are loosely pegged to the U.S. dollar .
The number of Taiwanese tourists coming to Japan , for example , dropped 14 % for the first three months .
And tourism from Hong Kong dropped 9 % .
`` When travel was first liberalized in these countries , Japan was a first destination because it is close , '' explains the tourist organization 's Mr. Kamimura .
`` But the cheapest destinations are now other -LCB- Southeast Asian -RCB- countries such as the Philippines and Thailand .
'' The tourism board is trying to counter Japan 's `` too expensive to touch '' image , Mr. Kamimura adds .
The organization is having seminars overseas to help travel agents promote the leaner side of Japan travel .
It also recently published a brochure suggesting cheap ways to enjoy Tokyo .
Recommended freebies include a visit to the Toyota Auto Salon -LRB- `` dedicated to total enjoyment of automobiles and provides a wide range of enjoyable information '' -RRB- and the Sony Showroom -LRB- `` displays Sony 's newest home appliances '' -RRB- .
JAPANESE `` theme '' travelers seem to prefer gore to rustic charm .
U.S. tours based on the bestseller `` The Bridges of Madison County '' have flopped , agents report .
But Japanese are calling a special `` Dracula Hotline '' to sign up for a vampire-inspired tour of Romania 's Transylvania ... Breaking into the travel business can take stamina : Tobu Travel decided this year to select employees based on their ability to persevere in sporting events .
`` Travel is up , but our revenues are down , '' explains a spokesman .
`` We need people that have endurance and strength .
'' NEW YORK -- The Treasury-bond market ended a quiet session yesterday with prices nearly 7\/8 point lower , thanks to a weak dollar and concerns over how the market will receive a round of new issuance from the government this week .
However , with the market mired in the summer doldrums , activity was subdued and price action somewhat exaggerated by the thin conditions , traders said .
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped nearly 7\/8 point , or nearly $ 8.75 for a bond with a $ 1,000 face value , to 99 8\/32 .
Its yield , which moves in the opposite direction of its price , rose to 7.55 % from 7.49 % on Friday .
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon 's expected victory in the Mexican presidential race sparked a strong rally in the Latin American debt markets yesterday , pushing up prices of bonds issued by Brazil and Venezuela by as much as three points , traders said .
Mexican bonds rose less , just more than a point , because Mr. Zedillo 's expected victory had already been priced into the market , said traders .
The dollar extended its losses from last week during the New York bond trading session on continuing concerns over the coming framework trade talks between Japan and the U.S. .
The dollar sank to an intraday low of 97.75 yen , compared to its closing level of 98.70 yen Friday in New York .
`` The dollar definitely gave a negative bias to the market , '' said Jim Kenney , head of fixed income at Prudential Securities Inc. `` A lot of people did n't expect the dollar to get hit this hard .
I do n't know if you 're going to get much of a rebound from these levels .
'' The weak dollar also triggered talk in the market that the Federal Reserve may have to raise interest rates again sooner than expected , with last week 's aggressive tightening having little impact .
A declining dollar diminishes the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets , such as Treasurys , especially for foreign investors .
It also raises inflation fears because a lower dollar boosts the cost of imported goods .
However , while bond-market participants are keeping a close eye on the dollar 's movements , few are ready to push the panic button yet .
`` As long as it trades between 97 and 100 yen , it will be fine , '' said Eric Cheung , vice president of the investment-management department at Wilmington Trust Co. `` But if it trades to 95 yen , things will get dicey and the Fed would definitely have to move up the time frame of its next tightening .
'' The dollar 's troubles come at a time when dealers are getting set to underwrite another batch of new government issuance .
The Treasury is scheduled to sell $ 17.25 billion of two-year notes today and $ 11 billion of five-year notes tomorrow .
Although many bond participants contend the new two-year and five-year Treasury issues are attractively priced , concern over the the lower dollar , along with underlying jitters about the pace of economic growth , may limit demand at the auctions , some participants said .
`` With the dollar near the lower end of its range and looking like there may be further pressure on it , that could make participants less than willing to bid for supply this week , '' said David Schroeder , a portfolio manager at Benham Management Corp. in Mountain View , Calif. .
Many portfolio managers are opting to stay away from this week 's auctions and are n't getting too deeply involved in the market until a clearer picture of economic activity unfolds , they said .
`` We 're going to sit on our hands , '' said Patrick Retzer , director of fixed income at Heartland Fund in Milwaukee .
`` Between the inflation issue and the dollar returning to its lows for the year , I do n't see a compelling reason to get real aggressive .
'' However , for some participants , particularly individual investors , the two-year and five-year notes may hold value , traders said .
In when-issued trading late yesterday , the two-year note yielded 6.31 % and the five-year note yielded 6.98 % .
`` For individual investors there is some value based on where certificate-of-deposit rates are , and you saw fairly good participation in the last two-year auction from individuals , '' said Mr. Schroeder of Benham .
Along with individuals , banks and dealers are expected to take much of today 's two-year offering with larger retail interests again expected to stay on the sidelines .
Meanwhile yesterday , the Treasury sold $ 24.56 billion of three-month and six-month bills at its regular weekly auction .
Here are details from the auction : Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it .

Latin American bond prices rallied yesterday in response to the expected victory of Mr. Zedillo in the Mexican presidential race .
However , the prices of Latin American debt and other corporate debt fell slightly later in the day as the U.S. Treasury market plunged .
One trader said factors other than the Mexican election contributed to rising Latin American bond prices , including a new economic plan expected to be unveiled later this week in Venezuela .
The rally had less of an effect on Mexican debt , `` which already had a tremendous rally going into the election , '' a trader noted .
Mexican Brady bonds rose by more than one point during the session , but Mexican corporate and sovereign debt remained unchanged .
Brady bonds are sovereign debts restructured into bonds under the plan designed by former Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady .
`` Everyone knew the Institutional Revolutionary Party was going to win , '' a trader said .
The PRI , its Spanish abbreviation , is the ruling party .
`` From a foreign investor 's point of view , it 's been a very good outcome , '' said Joyce Chang , a director in the emerging-markets research group at Salomon Brothers Inc. .
If Mr. Zedillo wins with less than 50 % of the vote , that would send a signal that more power-sharing has to occur , creating a more democratic and stable environment in Mexico , she added .
Economic growth , which had been hindered in the past two years by free-trade negotiations as well as political uprisings in the southern state of Chiapas and the assassination of the first ruling party presidential candidate , is expected to surge in Mexico now that the election is out of the way , according to Azmat Zuberi , sovereign-ratings analyst at Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. .
The election win `` gives Mexico a window of opportunity , '' says Mr. Zuberi .
`` We feel that investors will provide a catalyst for growth .
'' Mexico managed to attract $ 8 billion in foreign investment during the first seven months of 1994 , according to Duff & Phelps .
In addition , second-quarter economic growth exceeded analysts ' expectations at 3.8 % .
Duff & Phelps , which affirmed Mexico 's triple-B credit rating yesterday , is the only credit rating agency to give Mexico investment-grade status .
Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group rates Mexico in the junk-bond category at single-B-plus with a positive outlook , while Moody 's Investors Service Inc. has assessed Mexican debt at Ba2 .
Ratings upgrades from Moody 's and S&P , however , are expected at the end of this year or in the first quarter of 1995 .
`` Everyone seems to be pretty positive on the underlying fundamentals , '' says Stephen Lockman , senior fixed-income analyst at Stein Roe & Farnham Inc. in Chicago .
`` It will be interesting to see when and if they get the upgrade , how many additonal buyers '' will come into the market , he adds , noting that until now buyers of Mexican issues have been limited because of the junk-bond rating .
Meanwhile , the new-issue market in the U.S. remained quiet yesterday while attention turned south of the border .
No companies sold bonds but about $ 750 million of federal agency debt was sold .
Secondary trading remained thin with activity focused on the junk bonds of Revlon Consumer Products Corp. and Revlon Worldwide Corp. .
Investment-grade prices dropped with Treasurys while junk bond prices fell by 1\/4 point , traders said .
In the secondary corporate market , the most active bonds were those of Revlon Consumer Products and Revlon Worldwide , which rallied on a company announcement that a report issued by Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group Friday inaccurately reported key financial data .
Revlon Worldwide is a unit of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. and owns 100 % of the equity of Revlon Consumer Products .
MacAndrews is owned by New York investor Ronald Perelman .
S&P revised its ratings outlook on Revlon Consumer Products and Revlon Worldwide to negative from positive on Friday .
Revlon contends that S&P is mistaken in its conclusions .
Prices of municipal bonds ended narrowly mixed in sluggish trading , but activity is expected to liven up a little today , when more than $ 300 million of debt likely will be offered .
Due to sell offerings today are issuers including Los Angeles , Utah 's Alpine School District and the New York State Mortgage Agency .
Los Angeles will sell $ 111.3 million of Series 1994A general obligation bonds , and the Alpine School District will offer $ 73 million of school-building improvement bonds .
Underwriters led by CS First Boston are expected to price the New York State Mortgage Agency 's $ 153 million homeownership mortgage revenue bonds .
The Los Angeles bonds have been rated double-A by Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group .
S&P also said yesterday that it has revised its ratings outlook on Los Angeles to stable from negative .
In the secondary market yesterday , the Tennessee Housing Development Agency 's 6.55 % bonds due 2019 ended 1\/8 higher at 98 1\/8 , to yield 6.67 % .
However , Portland , Ore. 's 6.25 % bonds due 2015 ended 1\/2 lower at 99 1\/2 , to yield 6.23 % .
Prices of mortgage-backed securities ended 1\/8 to 1\/4 point lower in light trading .
Mortgage issues were dragged lower by skittishness in the Treasury market , but prices held better than those of comparable-maturity Treasurys , traders said .
Most investors are holding mortgage positions in line with market indexes but are unwilling to add to their investments with a bearish sentiment in the bond market , traders said .
The bulk of investors also chose to stay out of the pass-through market yesterday , leaving dealers to dominate trading .
In the market for collateralized mortgage obligations , investors are beginning to look at second-tier bonds , traders said .
While planned amortization classes of CMOs with two-year to three-year average lives have seen strong demand over the last few months , investors are now beginning to look at slightly longer average-life PACs .
Also , some investors are exploring buying opportunities in PACs that have fallen out of their prepayment bands .
Trading in these securities picked up yesterday as the market saw a few buyers , traders said .
PACs are bonds that have a predetermined amortization schedule tied to a prevailing interest-rate level .
They typically have an upper and lower limit on interest rates , in between which the amortization schedule will be honored .
If interest rates move to levels outside the predetermined bands , the PACs are called broken and do n't pay according to schedule .
Several investors are now looking at broken PACs , expecting that interest rates will be less volatile than the past year , allowing PAC securities to deliver better performance .
In secondary trading , Government National Mortgage Association 8 % issues for September delivery ended 6\/32 lower at 98 17\/32 .
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 8 % Gold issues ended 6\/32 lower at 98 26\/32 .
Federal National Mortgage Association 8 % issues ended 6\/32 lower at 98 23\/32 .
BOSTON -- The Wampanoag Indians of Gay Head are expected to announce today an agreement with Massachusetts Gov. William Weld outlining terms under which the tribe could open a proposed $ 150 million gambling casino in the state .
The `` memorandum of understanding '' between the state and the tribe would represent an important step in the tribe 's previously announced plan to build Massachusetts ' first casino .
But the plan may be stymied by the state 's Legislature , where opposition to the casino has been voiced by a number of lawmakers .
The Wampanoags , a loosely confederated group of Algonquin peoples in southeast Massachusetts , have proposed to build the casino and theme park in New Bedford , Mass. , with financial backing from Carnival Hotels & Casinos , based in Coconut Grove , Fla. .
The Wampanoags are the only Native Americans eligible under federal law to own a casino in Massachusetts .
SAN FRANCISCO -- BankAmerica Corp. and Continental Bank Corp. , which expect to complete their previously announced merger on Aug. 31 , announced the final terms of the transaction .
Continental shareholders will receive either 0.7993 BankAmerica common share or $ 38.297 cash for each of their Continental shares .
The owners of 27.8 million Continental shares elected to receive stock , and 21.9 million requested cash .
Because San Francisco-based BankAmerica plans to issue only about 21.5 million shares in the transaction , some Continental shareholders who preferred to receive stock will receive cash .
They will be chosen randomly and will be notified about the time the merger is completed .
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading , BankAmerica rose 12.5 cents to $ 47.75 , and Continental rose 12.5 cents to $ 38.125 .
When the merger is completed , Continental , based in Chicago , will be renamed Bank of America Illinois .
When it comes to questions of , er , gender , the French have a certain reputation .
And so we were interested to see in the premiere issue of the American version of Marie Claire , a chic French women 's magazine , a story titled `` The Feminist Mistake .
'' According to a Marie Claire-Gallup poll , only one in three American women considers herself a feminist , 51 % think the women 's movement hurts relations between the sexes , and 57 % say feminist leaders do not reflect the views of a majority of American women .
Asks Marie Claire : `` Could it be that women believe feminism -- with its emphasis on victimization and gender wars -- has abandoned them ?
'' Oui , Marie Claire , c'est ca .
At Massachusetts Institute of Technology , a rubber ball bounces off my index finger and returns sharply moments later , as if it had rebounded off a wall .
No big thrill , except for one thing : The ball exists only in a nearby computer .
Virtual reality is entering the tactile stage , and surgical studies , musical instruments and video games may never be the same .
Compellingly palpable but nonexistent objects are being created at MIT by a desktop device resembling a dwarf robot 's arm .
The movable arm has a freely swiveling thimble where its hand should be .
By inserting a finger in the thimble , a person can `` touch '' cubes , keyboards , fingerpaints or balls .
The illusion is created by varying resistance the computer-controlled arm exerts through the thimble against one 's finger .
Called the Phantom , the device was cooked up last year by a student , Thomas Massie , based on an idea by his adviser , Kenneth Salisbury .
Mr. Massie has never advertised the Phantom , but when he recently began selling copies of it to researchers , he got so many orders that he could n't keep up .
`` It 's a beautiful piece of work , '' says Brent Gillespie , who is tinkering with it at Interval Research Corp. , a Palo Alto , Calif. , research company formed by Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen .
Interval , which owns four of the 13 Phantoms Mr. Massie has sold to date , wo n't disclose specific plans for them .
But robot experts familiar with the Phantom can imagine many uses .
Detroit 's engineers might mold next year 's car models with their fingers , sculpting fenders from blocks of `` virtual '' clay as the results are shown on a video display .
Wielding a Phantom-mounted scalpel , a surgeon could practice a tricky procedure on a computerized model of a patient .
A bioengineer could handle a blown-up model of a viral molecule to find its Achilles heel to attack with new drugs .
A musician could pluck a Phantom guitar that , at the flick of a switch , becomes castanets .
And computer games may gain a whole new dimension : One of the illusory objects Mr. Massie has created with the Phantom might pass as a ghastly glob of throbbing protoplasm .
A handful of companies have developed force-reflecting joysticks , gloves and other systems , such as Exos Inc. , Woburn , Mass. ; Sarcos Inc. , Salt Lake City ; and Cybernet Systems Corp. , Ann Arbor , Mich. .
But experts say Mr. Massie 's device stands out because of its relatively low cost , $ 19,500 compared with $ 200,000 or more for some of the fancier systems , and because it can give more vivid tactile impressions .
Tapping commands into his personal computer , Mr. Massie , an MIT graduate student , activates a program that enables aspiring surgeons to biopsy a brain tumor .
As the Phantom 's thimble is pushed , a simulated needle slides into a brain -- a scanner image of an actual patient 's head shown on a computer display .
When the needle pierces the dura , a tough layer of tissue encasing the brain , the thimble 's resistance suddenly lessens , giving the feeling of a slight pop .
At Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M. , researchers are exploring ways to use the Phantom in sophisticated `` surgical rehearsal '' systems .
Surgeons typically learn on the job , says William Orrison , a radiologist working with the Sandia team .
`` That means the results often are n't as good as they might be .
'' Besides training new sawbones , he envisions a veteran surgeon boning up for an operation with a detailed Phantom model of a patient that familiarizes the doctor with the person 's internal idiosyncrasies .
Another possible use is teaching patients how to examine themselves for abnormalities such as breast tumors .
Mr. Massie grew up in Vanceburg , Ky. , population 2,000 , a county seat he describes as having one four-way stoplight , a Dairy Queen -- and no McDonald 's .
During his first month in Boston , he says , `` I kept jerking my head around every time somebody honked because I thought it was somebody who knew me .
'' Asked by MIT friends where Vanceburg is , he places it this way : `` It 's 45 minutes from the nearest Radio Shack '' in Portsmouth , Ohio .
Mr. Massie built his first robot arm in seventh grade .
Many of the parts came from broken appliances he offered to repair ; after they were reduced to a heap of pieces , he says , they were beyond fixing but perfect for inventing robots .
Eventually , `` my mom would n't let me work on anything unless it was really broken .
'' Undeterred , he scavenged elsewhere and by 10th grade had cobbled together a `` seeing '' robot that picked up Easter eggs and sorted them into containers by color .
At MIT , Mr. Massie won renown in a contest in which student-built robots vied to carry ping-pong balls across a table and dump them in a box faster than opposing robots could .
`` I decided that if I could get 200 balls in the box in less than a second and simultaneously block the other robots from dumping any balls , I 'd probably win , '' he says .
He did .
Striving to keep the Phantom simple and compact , Mr. Massie mounted small electric motors on the device 's arms so they simultaneously exert computer-controlled forces and serve as moving counterbalances , doing two crucial tasks at the same time -- a design engineer 's version of a 360-degree slam dunk .
Mr. Massie , 23 years old , has formed Sensable Devices Inc. , a family company , to sell Phantoms .
`` I think about dropping out of school every day '' to work full-time on commercializing the Phantom , he says .
MIT has filed a patent application on the device .
Mr. Massie will own the patent rights , but he frets that rivals will develop similar systems that would wipe out his commercial edge .
Indeed , Interval 's Mr. Gillespie predicts that `` in five years you 'll see a number of force-reflecting devices on the market , '' including a `` powered mouse , '' a hand-held , force-reflecting computer controller that could train users to execute a sequence of commands by pushing their hands around .
But Mr. Massie already has some new ideas to keep the competition scrambling : He 's designing Phantom II , a cheaper version that eventually may be sold as a consumer device .
The Russian government offered compensation for property seized or lost in repressions since the 1917 Bolshevik revolution .
Millions of former Soviets or their families are eligible for payments .
But some Russians scoffed at the program , saying the maximum payment of 100 times the monthly minimum wage -- this now works out to less than $ 1,000 -- is too low , and the claims procedure too complex , as few required documents exist .
Moreover , compensation for undeveloped land ca n't exceed 40 times the minimum monthly wage , and nationalized assets such as factories wo n't be returned .
The order marks an effort to purge Russia of its Communist Party legacy .
But it also poses a financial and legal nightmare for cash-strapped authorities in a country where almost every family has been affected by political purges .
Tens of millions of Russians were executed , starved to death during forced farm reforms , imprisoned , sent to Siberian camps , robbed of their posessions or otherwise repressed under Soviet rule .
Malaysia proposed legal changes to allow caning of white-collar criminals and illegal immigrants , the Star newspaper reported .
Women now are exempt from flogging , used only to punish male drug addicts and men convicted of kidnapping or armed robbery .
The plan to cane people convicted of crimes such as embezzlement or fraud is intended to shame them in society .
And Malaysia hopes to combat illegal immigrants , many of them women who are smuggled into the country to work as maids .
Such offenders could be caned while clothed .
Caning also is used in Singapore , where the case of a U.S. teenager prompted international protests .
The breakaway Trans-Dniester region of Moldova introduced its own ruble currency , to be exchanged at the rate of one for every 100 Soviet-issued rubles until Oct. 1 , when the old banknotes will no longer be honored .
The self-proclaimed republic is trying to establish itself as an independent economic entity .
The region in the eastern area of the former Soviet republic was the site of a 1991-92 civil war between Russian-speaking separatists and the Moldovan government .

Eurowoodstock , a Budapest music festival on an island in the Danube River , could be a financial washout , organizers said .
The weeklong rock fest opened last Thursday under heavy rains .
By Sunday night , only 64,000 tickets had been sold , indicating that attendance could fall short of the expected 150,000 and that revenue wo n't cover costs of $ 750,000 .
Eurowoodstock follows the recent Woodstock '94 festival in New York state that attracted 350,000 people ; both events recall the landmark Woodstock rock concert 25 years ago .
Singapore said it would allow companies to provide satellite communications links in an effort to make the city-state a regional broadcasting center .
These telecommunications services now are provided only by two government-controlled enterprises .
Licensing more operators is intended to spur technological innovations and competitive pricing , the telecommunications agency said .
Applicants may have foreign equity participation of up to 49 % .
Fiji is getting a boost from growth in tourism and sugar production .
The government predicted the economy will expand at least 3.8 % this year , exceeding its March forecast of 3.2 % and recovering smartly from just 1.7 % growth last year , when a cyclone hit the South Pacific country .
Tourist arrivals in 1994 could exceed 300,000 , up from a record 287,658 visitors in 1993 .
Sugar output is expected to top 450,000 metric tons , up from 442,156 tons .
Russian Economics Minister Alexander Shokhin dismissed a top official 's suggestion that international creditors should forgive part of the country 's foreign debt .
He said the government does n't plan to seek a write-off of any of its $ 80 billion in debt to governments and commercial lenders , much of which was inherited from the former U.S.S.R. .
He said such a move would threaten global confidence in Russia and cause a drop in foreign investment .
Last week , Oleg Davydov , minister of foreign economic relations , said creditors should forgive part of the debts to reward Russia 's post-Cold War role in achieving international stability .
But Russia does want to continue rescheduling debt , Mr. Shokhin said .
It is complying with terms for loans issued after the U.S.S.R. collapsed in 1991 .

THE U.S. WILL HOLD Cuban refugees at Guantanamo `` indefinitely , '' Perry said .
The defense secretary visited the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and said up to 10,000 Cubans would be housed there to prevent an exodus of refugees from reaching the U.S. Washington officials stressed that the Cubans taken to Guantanamo , where 15,000 Haitians are detained , had no chance of being admitted to the U.S. as political refugees .
Perry said that the U.S. hopes to send some of the Cubans to the Turks and Caicos Island , Suriname and Panama .
He described a blockade of Cuba as an alternative but `` not an option we ` re actively deploying for at this point .
'' Coast Guard officials in Florida said their vessels picked up 1,367 Cubans by late afternoon , the highest one-day total recorded for 14 years .
Majority Leader Mitchell met with lawmakers to seek common ground on Senate health legislation .
He was trying to reach out to a bipartisan `` mainstream coalition '' and bridge Democratic differences .
A compromise plan drew fire from groups representing labor , the elderly and consumers .
The Senate began considering Clinton 's crime bill , and Judiciary Committee chief Biden declared that the legislation was `` one step away '' from being signed by the president .
But the debate promises to be heated , with Republicans vowing to derail the measure with a parliamentary move .

PARIS -- Selling off a major line of business and lopping off one-tenth of one 's sales could be viewed by some as a sign of retrenchment .
But the way Cie. de Saint Gobain sees it , it 's a signal that it 's back on the expansion trail .
By recently agreeing in principle to sell off its paper and packaging activities to Ireland 's Jefferson Smurfit Group PLC in a transaction valued at 5.63 billion French francs -LRB- $ 1.07 billion -RRB- , Saint Gobain , the French industrial-materials group , has cut its size and its range of businesses .
But it has also filled its coffers with fresh cash .
And because Saint Gobain `` does n't usually sleep on a pile of cash , '' says Philippe Lubineau , an analyst at Barclays de Zoette Wedd in Paris , the company is on the prowl for new opportunities .
`` We consider that we are in a position to make acquisitions in the next 12 months , '' Chairman Jean-Louis Beffa said in a telephone interview last week , adding that the company also intends to grow its core activities , which include glass , insulation materials , construction materials , pipes , industrial ceramics and abrasives , through direct investment .
Big acquisitions and major investments had n't been part of Saint Gobain 's strategy in the past few years .
The fact that Mr. Beffa is talking of them again is the latest sign that leading French business executives are starting to see a recovery around the corner .
In the past month , a series of indicators , including the first monthly drop in unemployment in four years and a quarterly increase in industrial production , have given rise to cautious optimism in the French business community .
Such top companies as auto maker PSA Peugeot Citroen SA , pharmaceuticals and chemicals concern Rhone-Poulenc SA and Saint Gobain have released higher sales figures for the first half , providing further testimony of a budding recovery , and analysts expect corporate profits to show a strong improvement this year .
By pursuing expansion , Mr. Beffa is placing Saint Gobain back on the growth path it set out on in the 1980s .
Chosen as the first group to be privatized by France 's conservative government in 1986 , Saint Gobain , like many other big French groups , spent the rest of the decade aggressively expanding , especially in the U.S. .
In 1988 , Saint Gobain bought the 43 % it did n't already own of CertainTeed Corp. , the glass-fiber insulation , building materials and piping products group , for $ 387 million , and then bought control of Wolverine Technologies Inc. , a maker of vinyl products , for $ 79.9 million .
In 1990 , Saint Gobain topped this with one of the biggest U.S. takeovers by a French company , a friendly $ 1.9 billion acquisition of Norton Co. that rescued the U.S. abrasives and ceramics company from a hostile bid by Britain 's BTR PLC. .
But just then the recession came .
As befits a company whose main product is glass , Saint Gobain closely reflected the downturn of French industry .
After rising steadily throughout the 1980s , Saint Gobain 's sales and profits started falling year after year .
Last year alone , profits fell a whopping 45 % , to 1.31 billion francs from 2.38 billion francs in 1992 .
Cutting debt and costs became the new buzzword at Saint Gobain headquarters .
The sale of La Cellulose du Pin , its paper , pulp and packaging unit , is viewed by analysts as the last major chapter of this effort .
To be sure , not everyone is happy about it .
Unions have protested at the sale and the Socialist Party has denounced `` the total absence of any industrial policy in a sector where France should have important assets .
'' Even the business daily La Tribune Desfosses noted that Saint Gobain 's decision to end its 70-year involvement in the paper business means that the whole sector is now almost entirely under foreign ownership .
But Mr. Beffa retorts that Cellulose du Pin was `` too small and too French '' to be a global competitor .
While some analysts say Saint Gobain should perhaps have retained its packaging activities , which are likely to return to the black with the recovery , Saint Gobain says it seized the opportunity of Jefferson Smurfit 's interest in its range of pulp , paper and packaging activities to turn them over to a `` dynamic and international group that 's capable of improving their productivity .
'' Analysts salute the move as a long overdue strategic decision that strengthens Saint Gobain 's balance sheet and allows it to focus on its strategy of being a global player in its core activities .
Summing up the feeling of most analysts , Mr. Lubineau sent out a note on the transaction with a headline that simply read `` Finally !
'' The market appears to share that assessment : Saint Gobain shares rose 3.6 % the day after it announced the transaction .
In trading yesterday , shares closed at 674 francs .
Analysts note that Cellulose du Pin was bleeding red ink -- it had a loss of 1.1 billion francs in 1993 -- and Jefferson Smurfit 's agreement to assume the paper and packaging division 's net debt , up to a maximum of 2.9 billion francs , meets Saint Gobain 's desire to cut its debts .
By selling Cellulose du Pin , Saint Gobain will reap a capital gain of about 900 million francs .
Coupled with the company 's recent 3.6 billion franc capital increase through a rights issue , Saint Gobain is now in a position to resume expansion .
`` The company has performed very well in the recession , '' says Alan Coats , an analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London .
`` Between 1990 and now , they ` ve transformed financial strain into potential .
'' The big question now is what Saint Gobain intends to do with that potential .
Most analysts contend Saint Gobain will use a mixture of medium-size acquisitions and investments to grow its main businesses in new markets .
Mr. Beffa is coy about his expansion plans , but makes no secret of the fact that he wants to expand in the glass business .
Saint Gobain recently announced it was building glass plants in Brazil and Chile , and Mr. Beffa has expressed interest in expanding in Eastern Europe and Asia .
But Mr. Lubineau says he thinks Saint Gobain should parlay the experience of the U.S. market it has gained through its acquisition of Norton to get into the glass business there too , either directly or through an investment in Mexico , taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement .
`` It 's a source of weakness for Saint Gobain that its main competitors in flat glass are present in Europe and it is n't implanted in the U.S. or Japan , '' he says .
Another possible move suggested by several analysts is raising Saint Gobain 's stake in lens-maker Essilor International , in which it already holds 20 % .
Essilor 's stock surged after Saint Gobain announced it was getting out of the paper business .
NEW YORK -- Stocks edged lower as the dollar weakened against major currencies for a fourth-straight session .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.89 , or 0.10 % , to 3751.22 .
The U.S. currency slipped in value by roughly a pfennig against the mark and by nearly a full yen against the Japanese currency .
The sliding currency has exacerbated continuing fears among stock investors about higher inflation and tighter credit , said Alan Ackerman , a market strategist at Reich & Co. .
Those concerns have been prevalent all year .
Weakness in the dollar makes imported goods more expensive and could nudge prices higher throughout the U.S. economy .
Interest-rate increases , meanwhile , could be used as a way to prop up the dollar or head off that inflation .
Action in the dollar had n't been a major concern for stock investors for nearly a month as it stabilized after hitting lows in mid-July .
But the currency has come back into focus since the middle of last week .
It has been driven lower by worries about the U.S. trade deficit with Japan and the absence of hoped-for interest-rate cuts in Europe .
A steep sell-off in bonds added to the unease in the stock market .
Bond investors also were unsettled by the dollar 's decline , expecially in light of Treasury-note auctions scheduled for this week .
The 30-year bond fell nearly 7\/8 point , lifting its yield to 7.55 % .
The Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index slid 1.36 , or 0.29 % , to 462.32 ; the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.54 , or 0.21 % , to 255.27 ; and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index slipped 1.16 , or 0.26 % , to 437.48 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index was slightly stronger than the Big Board-dominated indexes .
It eased just 0.14 , or 0.02 % , to 742.29 .
The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index managed a gain of 0.32 , or 0.07 % , to 445.77 .
Novell dropped 1 1\/8 to 14 on Nasdaq .
The Provo , Utah , company estimated that its earnings for the fiscal third quarter ended July 31 , excluding one-time items , were 15 % to 20 % below the 25 cents a share that many Wall Street analysts had expected .
It blamed lower-than-anticipated revenue from its recently acquired WordPerfect and Quattro Pro operations , as well as higher expenses .

Glaxo 's American depositary receipts were unchanged at 19 7\/8 .
Continental Corp. fell again following news Thursday that the New York insurer eliminated its 25-cent quarterly dividend as part of an effort to strengthen its finances .
The stock lost 1 to 15 7\/8 , after losing 1 on Friday .
On Thursday it edged up 5\/8 .
Teva Pharmaceutical -LRB- Nasdaq -RRB- increased 1 1\/2 to 27 5\/8 after CNBC reported that the Israeli company has had merger talks with Ivax of Miami .
Ivax declined to comment on the report , which was based on unnamed sources .
A spokesman for Teva could n't be reached .
Ivax shares increased 1 to 21 5\/8 on Amex .
The relatively smaller , more growth-oriented issues of the Nasdaq Stock Market and Amex have outperformed bigger and more economically sensitive issues for two weeks .
Investors are said to be looking for companies whose earnings will grow even if the economic expansion weakens .
Raymond J. Urban , chief investment strategist at Duff & Phelps , said he expects growth stocks to help lead the market solidly higher over the balance of the year .
`` We 've had a little over two years of good performance from cyclical stocks .
We are about due now for a transition in leadership , '' he said .
Mr. Urban expects the fears about interest rates and the dollar to ease .
The economy will slow enough to allow Treasury-bond yields to ease to between 7 % and 7.25 % , but not so much that corporate profits turn broadly lower , he believes .
He expects the stock market to advance 7 % or 8 % by January .
ATLANTA -- Delta Air Lines and AT&T Corp. are expected to announce today an agreement under which the communications company will take over management of the carrier 's back-office computer operations .
The magnitude of the accord , to be unveiled at a news conference in New York by Delta Chairman Ronald W. Allen and AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen , is n't clear .
It is , however , expected to provide significant savings and revenue to Delta , which is in the midst of a cost-cutting plan to eliminate $ 2 billion in annual expenses by 1997 .
The transaction with AT&T has been in the works since before Delta began its restructuring in April .
MOSCOW -- Russia 's MMM investment company , which the government contends is a pyramid scheme , reopened its doors yesterday , offering Russians another chance to buy into the dream returns that brought MMM notoriety before it collapsed last month .
And , waiting into the evening on a muddy sidewalk under a chill rain , thousands of Russians lined up to buy .
`` I understand it 's a pyramid scheme , '' said one customer , 34-year-old widow Marina Sviridenko , who lost money last month when MMM 's share price plunged in July from 125,000 rubles -LRB- $ 62.50 -RRB- to about 1,000 rubles .
Now , says Ms. Sviridenko , she wants to buy more MMM shares `` because they are cheap '' and she is hoping to cash in on a new buying frenzy that might drive up the price a second time .
Authorities have denounced the MMM fund as a classic scam , in which money from new investors is used to pay profits to existing shareholders -- until new investments can no longer cover the payouts and the whole scheme crumbles .
The government is considering tighter regulation of securities markets , where pyramid schemes under Russia 's current hazy laws appear to be legal .
But for now , authorities simply warn investors they must judge carefully what they are buying .
If they lose money in the stock market , the state says it wo n't bail them out .
Russian President Boris Yeltsin calls the MMM crash `` a good lesson for our people .
'' But the lines yesterday in front of MMM offices around Moscow suggest that the lesson may be going in one ear and out the other , as MMM President Sergei Mavrodi recruits eager buyers for another round .
Arrested Aug. 5 , the day after his MMM fund stopped selling shares , Mr. Mavrodi has since been charged with resisting search and with evading taxes on one of his other companies .
From his jail cell last week , the 39-year-old Mr. Mavrodi ordered MMM to reopen and start selling tickets that the company promises to redeem for future shares .
And MMM continues to broadcast the get-rich-quick TV commercials that popularized its original scheme .
Part of the attraction for some investors yesterday was that MMM was promising to buy back some of its pre-closure shares from a select group of widows , invalids and veterans at pre-collapse prices .
But even to this group , MMM was n't handing out cash .
Rather , it was allowing these investors to register some of their shares to be considered later this month for MMM 's promised buyback .
Investors , however , were handing over cash to MMM on the spot , in exchange for tickets to buy future shares for 1,515 rubles , or 70 cents , each .
For this dubious privilege , MMM officials were allowing priority access to the same long line of widows , veterans and disabled customers it purports to be compensating -- offering them a chance to spend their money on MMM share-tickets ahead of a competing line of other anxious buyers .
Typical of the crowd was pensioner Galina Richkalova , who had lost most of her scant savings in MMM 's July collapse .
Thumbing through a wad of thousand ruble notes , Ms. Richkalova explained that she was desperate for money to support her family .
She 'd returned to buy new shares because `` I think that in a month , if I sell them , I 'll make some money .
'' Nearby , a student in wire-rimmed glasses and a thick gray sweater hefted a plastic bag containing his new stash of MMM tickets .
Asked if he thought MMM had any fundamental way of making money , he replied , `` For half a year , they showed they could .
'' INDIANAPOLIS -- Even if Congress and the president could find a magic bullet to `` end welfare as we know it , '' the gun that would fire the bullet -- the traditional welfare delivery system -- is in such a state of disrepair that misfires would be the order of the day .
I recently spent an afternoon working with intake officers in the county welfare department here .
The caseworkers I spoke with were well-intentioned , dedicated and caring .
But their comments were revealing .
Although most caseworkers want to see their clients become self-sufficient , they stressed that their job is to figure out what benefits the people who come into the office are eligible for , and to make sure that the right amount of money gets to the right people with the fewest errors .
This focus makes all the difference .
America Works , a private company that finds jobs for people on welfare , recently opened an office in Indianapolis .
Its biggest challenge ?
Getting welfare offices to send it enough potential clients .
The company has jobs lined up and waiting for workers , but it has received an average of just 20 referrals a month from local caseworkers .
Meanwhile , Indianapolis has 14,000 families on welfare .
What are the consequences for the welfare office when welfare recipients do n't find jobs ?
There are n't any .
By reimbursing almost all administrative costs incurred by local offices while imposing no meaningful performance requirements , the federal government offers the best deal in town : The more you spend , the more you get .
Do n't worry about results .
No matter what reforms are passed at the federal level , they must be accompanied by reform of the delivery system .
We need a competitive , performance-based system with many different providers .
They must be paid for how many people they get out of the welfare system , not how many people they keep in it .
A useful model is school reform -- government could `` charter '' local welfare offices , with pay based on performance .
This would allow innovative private providers of welfare to exist , take advantage of existing neighborhood-level institutions , and cause existing government welfare offices to produce results or go out of business .
With no penalties for failure and no rewards for success , you get cases like that of James Stokes .
To the welfare system , Mr. Stokes was 492108552701 , his case number .
When the welfare office passed him off to the local unemployment office -- the welfare office provided no job placement help of its own -- Mr. Stokes took another number and waited in line .
When an intake worker became available , Mr. Stokes would hand over his I.D. card , and would be assigned yet another number .
If the computer did not show any jobs for which Mr. Stokes appeared to be qualified , his visit would be dutifully logged in , and he would be sent on his way .
If a match did occur , Mr. Stokes would receive a notice in the mail a few days later telling him to show up at a certain place at a certain time for an interview .
Explains Mr. Stokes : `` I would have no idea what the job was , or who I was supposed to talk to , or how I was supposed to find transportation there .
'' He was sent unprepared to interview for jobs that were often filled long before he arrived .
He floated on and off welfare for eight years , and no one was held accountable .
Mr. Stokes 's story is a real-life example of why `` two years and out '' fails as a reform unless the delivery system itself is changed .
Mr. Stokes would continue to receive ineffective assistance in obtaining employment , while the federal government would continue to evaluate the performance of local offices based on such nonproductive measures as how many paperwork errors they make in a month .
At the end of two years , he would either be denied benefits or , more likely , would be given a job at taxpayers ' expense that offers him little chance of advancement .
Instead , Mr. Stokes found America Works .
And in one week America Works found Mr. Stokes a job as a line cook at a hotel restaurant , a position that the 28-year-old still holds almost a year later .
The immense variety of problems experienced by those who must at one time or other apply for welfare should be reflected in the delivery system .
One size does not fit all .
America Works gets paid for putting recipients in jobs .
But there is a wide range of performance measures that could be employed .
Depending on the desired outcome , government could reward charter welfare offices for every customer who obtains a GED , or for every teenage mother who attends school regularly , or for every mother whose kids attend school regularly .
A chartered welfare delivery system would also let government take advantage of some of the strongest forces for good in troubled neighborhoods .
The Care Center , a nonprofit organization closely affiliated with a local church , is one such organization in Indianapolis .
Cramped into a 90-year-old former school building adjacent to the church , the Care Center provides health care , shelter for the homeless and battered , counseling , child care , a kitchen , and a food pantry .
The director of the center , Ernie Medcalfe , says he would be interested in contracting to provide welfare services because the Care Center 's stabilizing influence in the neighborhood , its network through the church , and its understanding of the particular needs of the poor families in its neighborhood would make it a much better provider than government .
He thinks he can do a superior job finding work for his neighborhood 's welfare recipients and providing them with the support to keep working .
And he is right .
There are thousands of institutions like the Care Center in troubled neighborhoods across America .
We natter about welfare reform while allowing these resources to go untapped .
What of the current employees of welfare offices ?
Although government is probably the worst possible provider of welfare delivery services , existing government offices could be given the opportunity to participate in a diverse pay-for-performance system .
To succeed , they would have to fundamentally change their mission and culture .
But accountability and competition are powerful catalysts .
In Indianapolis we used such catalysts to dramatically improve our child-support collections .
For 12 years , I served as county prosecutor , which made me responsible for collecting child support .
Unlike welfare and virtually every other government operation , local child-support collection offices receive a small incentive payment from the federal government for performance : 6 % to 9 % of collections .
We decided to make two fundamental changes in our office to change our culture and our mission .
First , we decided to treat mothers who were trying to collect child support as our customers .
Second , and most important , teams of employees were given an opportunity for financial bonuses based on the amount of money they collected for their customers .
Dozens of changes followed .
We created evening and Saturday hours .
We let our customers make appointments -- we wanted to resemble a private law firm as much as possible .
We tried virtually every enforcement technique we could find , and even invented a few new ones .
We used `` most wanted '' lists .
We held amnesty programs .
We used credit bureau reports .
We put liens on houses and cars .
We intercepted everything from tax checks to lottery winnings .
And in 12 years , collections went from $ 900,000 per year to $ 36 million .
When you free good government employees from the bad systems they work in , miraculous things can happen .
The existing welfare delivery system is a well-meaning but misguided monopoly .
Break it up , encourage new and innovative providers , pay for the right results , and more people like Mr. Stokes will become producers of wealth instead of recipients of welfare .
Mr. Goldsmith , a Republican , is the mayor of Indianapolis .
NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch & Co. agreed to pay $ 20 million to $ 30 million to investors in its failed rare-coin and ancient-art limited partnerships , settling several investor lawsuits .
Approximately 3,500 investors in Merrill Lynch Athena Fund I , Athena Fund II and Numismatic Fine Arts World Coin Fund are affected and will be recompensed the full amount of their initial investment , minus the distributions the first two funds paid from 1986 through 1991 , according to a Merrill spokesman .
The New York brokerage firm is waiving the 9 % to 15 % fees and commissions it initially charged investors .
People close to the transaction said Merrill was anxious to settle the lawsuits before any possible criminal action was taken against the managing general partner of the funds , Los Angeles coin and sports memorabilia dealer Bruce McNall .
Mr. McNall recently filed for bankruptcy and is the target of a federal grand-jury investigation into possible fraudulent loan applications .
In May , European American Bank , I.J. Schroeder and a unit of Credit Lyonnais SA filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition in federal court against him , saying he owed them $ 160 million .
Mr. McNall could n't be reached to comment .
In partnership with Mr. McNall 's Numismatic Fine Arts International company , Merrill Lynch sold the $ 7.2 million Athena I coin fund in October 1986 , the $ 25.1 million Athena II coin and art limited partnership in February 1989 and the $ 16.1 million NFA World Coin Fund partnership in November 1990 .
Investors in the largest fund , Athena II , saw their initial investment of $ 1,000 per unit plummet to $ 260 per unit by 1993 , plus $ 131 in distributions , in Merrill 's own secondary market for partnerships .
Several investors in the partnerships filed lawsuits against Merrill Lynch after the brokerage firm disclosed in a letter to investors last month that 399 coins with a total value of $ 3.3 million were missing from the NFA World Coin partnership .
Merrill stressed that the firm has `` no legal liability '' for the partnerships , given that they initially were sold as speculative investments , and said the `` unique nature of the circumstances involving Mr. McNall , '' not any litigation , prompted the offer .
The terms were comparatively generous : Typically , in settlements of lawsuits related to risky limited partnerships , investors have to prove they were wronged or are only paid a fraction of cents on the dollar .
Mr. McNall is perhaps most known for his ownership of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team -LRB- he recently sold his majority stake -RRB- and for paying the record price for a baseball card -LRB- $ 451,000 for a circa 1910 Honus Wagner , a Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop -RRB- .
Merrill emphasized that while his company managed the fund , Mr. McNall was never a Merrill employee .
The funds still hold coin and ancient art in their inventories and the disposition of those items is undecided , a Merrill spokesman said .
GOLDEN VALLEY , Minn. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- General Mills Inc. is asking its 120,000 restaurant employees to urge Congress to defeat health care reform measures proposed by President Clinton and the House and Senate majority leaders .
The cereal and food company sent a letter and videotape to be shown to restaurant workers this month .
It calls for the defeat of plans that impose new costs on employers and employees .
General Mills joins major companies including International Business Machines Corp. , Eastman Kodak Co. and DuPont Co. in calling on employees to push for defeat of various health-care bills before Congress .
`` We want all our employees to have insurance , '' General Mills restaurant division executive Rick Walsh wrote in an Aug. 3 memo , `` but we strongly believe this can be accomplished without employer-employee mandates which would lead to higher prices , fewer guests and lost jobs for many of our employees .
'' The restaurant division offers a health-insurance plan to all employees who have worked for six months and are employed 15 hours a week or more .
Since many restaurant workers earn minimum wage , it would be difficult to cover new , government-mandated insurance costs by cutting pay , executives say .
WASHINGTON -- U.S. steel imports fell 11.5 % in June from May , and rose 24 % from June 1993 .
June imports totaled 2,208,736 tons , compared with 2,494,601 tons in May and 1,781,000 tons imported in June 1993 , according to the American Iron and Steel Institute 's compilation of Commerce Department statistics .
In June , imports represented 21.7 % of consumption , down from 24.5 % in May and up from 19.3 % in June 1993 .
But the American Institute for International Steel pointed out that imports of semifinished steel by U.S. steelmakers accounted for 20.4 % of the total import volume .
U.S. producers are buying imported semifinished steel in a bid to keep up with surging demand .
`` To bypass bottlenecks at the smelting stage , U.S. steelmakers imported unprecedented amounts of semifinished steel , mostly slabs and billets , '' the American Institute for International Steel said .
The American Iron and Steel Institute said steel imports for the first half of 1994 totaled 13,723,283 tons , an increase of 68 % from the 8,186,286 tons imported in the first half of 1993 .
Import penetration for the 1994 six-month period was 23.4 % of the market , compared with 16.2 % in the same year-earlier period .
Steel exports in June totaled 360,951 tons , up 9.6 % from the 329,374 tons exported in May , and up 7.3 % from the 336,436 tons exported in June 1993 .
Exports for the first six months of this year were 1,882,227 tons , down 11.3 % from the 2,121,509 tons exported in the same 1993 period .
WASHINGTON -- Banks continue to ease standards for consumer and business loans , and demand for business loans continued to rise , a new Federal Reserve survey shows .
In the latest Fed survey of senior loan officers , which covers the three months ended in mid-August , loan officers reported easing terms and standards on commercial and industrial loans to companies of all sizes .
However , more banks eased terms for middle-sized companies than for larger and smaller businesses .
Demand for business loans remained strong , although the rate of growth declined a bit .
However , higher interest rates caused mortgage loans to drop significantly , the survey said .
Home-equity lines of credit declined slightly , but consumer demand for auto and credit-card loans rose during the period .
The survey also showed that less than 10 % of the banks polled increased their lending in response to a Clinton administration program launched last spring to boost credit to small - and medium-sized businesses .
ATLANTIC CITY , N.J. -- When Charles Hurchalla held a reception above the Taj Mahal casino here , his honest business colleagues were there and so were his partners in crime .
Mr. Hurchalla , president of Petron Oil Corp. in Exton , Pa. , led David Shuster and Gerry DiTursi away from the party to an adjoining room , where they discussed how to cheat federal and state governments out of millions of dollars in fuel-tax revenue .
During the meeting , Mr. DiTursi took an electronic device from his briefcase and began moving it over the walls .
`` My body temperature dropped 40 degrees , '' Mr. Hurchalla recalls .
`` He said he was looking for bugs , and I knew he was n't from Terminix .
'' Mr. Hurchalla was shaken because he was working as an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service .
Fortunately , the listening devices the FBI had planted in the room were too sophisticated for Mr. DiTursi 's gadget to detect .
As an informant , Mr. Hurchalla was the catalyst in cracking a tax-evasion scheme operated by Russian and Italian organized crime figures .
Kiev-born Jacob Dobrer , the ringleader , pleaded guilty in federal court in Philadelphia to defrauding Pennsylvania , New Jersey , New York and the U.S. out of $ 48.5 million in taxes in this and related cases .
The case illustrates a new problem in law enforcement -- Russian organized-crime rings operating in the U.S. .
This is one of the unpleasant legacies of the fall of the Soviet Union .
`` As our Russian and Eurasian emigre groups have increased in size , so has the number of crimes in the United States attributed to Russian organized crime , especially major frauds and illegal money laundering , '' Deputy Attorney General Jamie Goerlick told a recent international crime conference .
While not yet as well-structured as the Italian-born Mafia , Russian organized crime is `` evolving faster than any organized crime group we have seen in the U.S. , '' says Jim Moody , chief of the FBI 's organized crime section .
The Russian groups , Mr. Moody says , are particularly well-educated and well-suited to financial thievery .
`` These people know what they 're doing , and they 're very good criminals , '' he says .
Last October , the attorney general 's organized crime council declared Russian organized crime a priority .
Before his recent trip to Moscow and other East European capitals , FBI Director Louis Freeh told Congress the number of investigations involving Russian organized crime and racketeering had doubled in two years .
`` It is likely that violence related to Russian\/Eurasian organized crime groups will increase dramatically as the groups expand their operations in America , '' he warned .
He also cited the risk of Russian crime groups being involved with the theft of nuclear materials .
While authorities say Russian crime groups are active in all kinds of crime , fuel-tax scams apparently are one of their favorite operations .
`` For better or worse , the Russians seem to have made their little niche in the criminal community , '' says Robert Courtney , an assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case that Mr. Hurchalla helped crack .
According to the indictment , the Russian groups controlled the sale of more than 50 million gallons of fuel oil , and cheated federal and state governments out of nearly $ 15 million between October 1991 and December 1992 .
Other Russian criminals specialize in evading excise taxes on gasoline .
`` The Russian emigre gasoline-excise-tax schemes , some with La Cosa Nostra connections ... are estimated to control the sale of more than 50 million gallons of gasoline a month , on which approximately $ 7 million in federal excise tax is evaded , '' Mr. Freeh says .
The Russian crime groups are buying into the tax scams by paying off the Mafia , according to Mr. Moody .
`` They 're not shooting each other , they 're cooperating , '' he says .
Mr. Hurchalla says he agreed to be an informant because `` I was losing an awful lot of money to these tax cheats .
'' His informing days began after he told the FBI he had been approached by a colleague in the oil business who `` asked me if I would be interested in attending a meeting where I could buy some cheap diesel fuel .
'' When he learned the details of the scam , he understood why he had been losing customers to competitors offering lower prices : By not paying taxes they could underbid him .
The fraud artists bilked the governments out of tax dollars through a complex series of paper transactions among mostly sham companies called a `` daisy chain .
'' The companies bought and sold No. 2 fuel oil , which is n't taxed when sold as home heating oil , but is taxed when sold as diesel fuel .
In the middle of the chain is a `` burn company , '' which on paper appears to have paid state and federal taxes at the point when the fraud operators decide to turn the tax-free fuel oil into taxable diesel fuel .
`` However , the taxes approximately 30 cents a gallon were never paid , '' reads a Justice Department document .
`` The tax money was used to fund the sale of the diesel fuel at below-market prices , and the remainder of the money was divided among the conspirators as their profit for participating in the scheme .
'' In an industry where the markup may be eight-tenths of a cent per gallon , the tax evasion allowed the corrupt company to sell diesel fuel at eight cents a gallon below market price , according to federal prosecutors .
As explained by Mr. Hurchalla , his Petron Oil sold tax-free heating oil that changed hands three times before a fourth concern , the burn company , sold it as diesel fuel .
It was then sold again to Bell Fuel Inc. in Philadelphia , which could sell it retail at a tax-included price .
At a meeting in the Guest Quarters Hotel in Plymouth Meeting , Pa. , Mr. Shuster gave a $ 40,000 18-karat gold Rolex watch to Mr. Hurchalla , who calls it a `` sales incentive award .
'' He was paid $ 513,670 for his participation in the daisy chain , including a duffel bag filled with $ 350,000 in cash .
Mr. Hurchalla gave the money and the watch to the government .
But he gave the government information as well .
Beginning with his first meeting , in December 1991 , in a diner in Bordentown , N.J. , Mr. Hurchalla secretly recorded two dozen sessions , some lasting several hours , and 150 telephone calls during his year as an informant .
After each meeting , such as the Plymouth Meeting one , federal agents would collect Mr. Hurchalla 's recording tape , debrief him and discuss what additional information was needed and how Mr. Hurchalla should try to get it .
`` There were certain things we wanted to find out , '' explains John Terry , an FBI agent who worked closely with Mr. Hurchalla .
They wanted to know everything from a suspect 's beeper number to oil-business complexities .
As a result of Mr. Hurchalla 's evidence , 17 people and three companies pleaded guilty or were convicted of charges relating to the scam .
Richard McNaughton , president of Bell Fuel Inc. , was convicted in May .
Mr. Shuster and Mr. DiTursi , of Russian and Italian crime groups respectively , had previously pleaded guilty .
Most await sentencing .
Mr. Dobrer , the group 's ringleader , has forfeited to the government $ 6.6 million and 16 vehicles that were proceeds from the illegal venture .
The 10 Jeeps , five Dodge Stealths and one Mercedes Benz 500E already were bound for Russia on a ship sailing across the sea when prosecutors received authority to seize them .
The shipping company faxed a restraining order prohibiting delivery of the $ 340,000 worth of cars , and the ship 's captain returned them to the U.S. Four Russians fled to their homeland to escape prosecution when their pending arrests became evident .
But in a sign of the increased cooperation between Russian and U.S. law enforcement that Mr. Freeh 's trip sought to further stimulate , the Russian authorities apprehended two suspects and turned them over to FBI agents in Russia for return to the U.S. , even though there is no extradition treaty between the two countries .
`` It was an act of cooperation that , at least for our district , was unprecedented , '' says federal prosecutor Mary Crawley .
The other two suspects , including Mr. Dobrer , a naturalized American , then voluntarily returned .
Though Mr. Hurchalla says he had no qualms about being interviewed for this story , he faced considerable danger as an informant .
If the mobsters discovered the oil executive was working with the feds , Mr. DiTursi warned at one point : `` I want you to know that the Italians will kill you , but the Russians will kill your whole family .
'' BURBANK , Calif. -- Walt Disney Co. formed a joint venture with Cie. Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion Multi Media to launch a satellite\/cable-television channel in Germany .
Disney also agreed in principle to supply programming to CLT Multi Media with a view toward exploring other ventures .
Disney , which already owns 25 % of a TV service in the United Kingdom , said it would `` evaluate the potential for similar services elsewhere in Europe , '' company Chairman Michael Eisner said in a statement .
Disney will supply part of the programming for a family-themed channel called Super RTL , which will reach 30 % to 35 % of all German households starting in 1995 .
The partnership , partly engineered by Walt Disney Studios President Rich Frank , signals a new aggressiveness by Disney in seeking equity in television-distribution systems rather than simply supplying programs .
By owning 50 % of the new venture , Disney can use its programming expertise to shape the entire channel .
It can help determine what other programs are acquired by the channel , and keep the Disney name prominent as part of the channel 's identity .
As television services in Europe proliferate , the importance of having `` themed '' channels increases , and though the new venture falls short of starting a channel under the actual Disney brand name , it moves closer to what Disney has with its pay-cable network , the Disney Channel , in the U.S. Although there are no quotas currently in force in Germany about how much U.S. programming can appear on a channel , RTL will air many hours of indigenous German programs .
Germany is Europe 's largest advertising market and is rapidly expanding , both because of the changes in Eastern Germany and because TV advertising was n't highly developed in the days when two government-run channels dominated the airwaves .
Since then , however , another station partly owned by CLT , called RTL , has become the No. 1 channel in the nation .
CLT also owns another channel in Germany , as well as channels in the Benelux countries .
Disney programs are currently broadcast all over Europe , distributed in Europe through `` output deals , '' under which the U.S. company supplies individual programs or program blocks to TV networks for a fee .
Disney has steered clear of pan-European networks , preferring to sell its programs territory-by-territory .
AUTHENTIC FITNESS Corp. -LRB- Van Nuys , Calif. -RRB- -- Kathy Van Ness , 43 years old , was named president of the swimwear and swim-accessory marketer 's newly formed swimwear division , which combines the company 's designer and Speedo swimwear divisions .
Ms. Van Ness was president of the designer swimwear division .
Christopher Staff , who had been president of the Speedo and White Stag\/Skiwear businesses since 1990 , is leaving to pursue other interests .
PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Co. , gaining an edge over rivals in the hotly contested Chinese power-generation market , is expected to announce two joint ventures there and a $ 100 million contract for steam turbines .
People familiar with the negotiations said a formal announcement could come as early as next week , during Commerce Secretary Ron Brown 's visit to China .
Westinghouse Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Jordan is a member of the delegation .
Westinghouse is expected to invest about $ 90 million in the joint ventures with China 's two largest steam turbine makers , Harbin Electrical Equipment Co. and Shanghai Heavy Machinery .
Westinghouse will own a 50 % stake in the ventures , under which the two Chinese manufacturers would increase their capacity by 60 % by licensing Westinghouse technology and eventually manufacturing steam turbines .
In a separate pact , Westinghouse is set to announce a $ 100 million contract to supply two 350-megawatt steam turbines to the Ministry of Power for the Ligang province .
The units will be manufactured in the U.S. Paul Tobin , a spokesman for Westinghouse , confirmed the company is `` in final negotiations for several projects in China '' but declined to elaborate .
China , with its growing appetite for electrical power , has become an intensely competitive battleground for companies such as Westinghouse , Siemens AG , ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. and General Electric Co. .
In fact , competition for Chinese orders has `` driven down the prices of turbines at Siemens , GE , Westinghouse and ABB , '' said Maureen Lentz , an analyst with Roulston Research Corp. `` There are a number of players competing , and the Chinese know how to bargain .
'' For Westinghouse , which faces sluggish domestic demand for most products , China is a key growth market .
Nicholas Heymann , an analyst at NatWest Securities Corp. , projects the new ventures will generate about $ 250 million in orders for the Pittsburgh-based company by 1995 .
That includes a multimillion-dollar service contract , details of which Westinghouse also is expected to reveal next week .
The service contract is with the Longyuan Power Technology Exploitation Corp. , a 50-50 venture through which Westinghouse will renovate and modernize steam turbine generators , a person familiar with the talks said .
Hoping to mine a relatively untapped field , companies are stepping up efforts to market their products and services to the growing number of minority-owned businesses in the U.S. But big corporations are finding that minority business communities , with their linguistic and cultural complexities , are n't easy to navigate .
As a result , some are coming up with more sophisticated ways to sell themselves .
`` Our most successful clients are those that maintain one underlying principle when marketing to ethnic groups and that is respect , '' says Gary L. Berman , president of Market Segment Research Inc. , a Coral Gables , Fla. , firm specializing in ethnic marketing .
`` Specifically , rather than simply placing an Hispanic , black or Asian in an advertisement , they are doing their homework and identifying the cultural and business hot buttons that are relevant .
'' Pacific Bell has set up a special Ethnic Markets Group to reach ethnic business owners in California with native-language business centers .
This spring , for example , the unit of Pacific Telesis Group , the regional Bell telephone company based in San Francisco , opened a business center for Vietnamese customers , who can order phone services in Vietnamese .
The center , in turn , sends out Vietnamese-speaking sales representatives or mails bilingual information to Vietnamese-American business owners .
Other corporations have seized on the business-center concept .
NationsBank Corp. is piloting a small-business resource center in Nashville , Tenn. .
The Charlotte , N.C. , banking company is working with the Commerce Department 's Minority Business Development Agency to teach would-be entrepreneurs about business plans and loan applications -- with the goal of turning those entrepreneurs into customers .
Meanwhile , other lenders have started pitching small-business loans through bilingual direct-mail campaigns .
Small-business owners are starting to take note .
Edward Kim , owner of Pacific Coast Retreading Inc. in Oakland , Calif. , says in his 11 years in business he has seen a sharp increase in the number of mailings and advertisements directed at him and other Asian-American business owners .
An active member of Oakland 's Korean-American business community , Mr. Kim says he welcomes more Korean-language marketing .
Why the push to market to ethnic entrepreneurs ?
Minority-owned concerns are the fastest growing -- and most underserved -- segment of the small-business market , consultants say .
In just five years , from 1982 to 1987 , their numbers soared 64 % to 1.2 million from 741,000 , according to the latest figures available from the U.S. Census Bureau .
And that trend is continuing : A recent study commissioned by the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce projects that the number of Hispanic businesses alone will more than double by the year 2000 to one million , from 422,000 in 1987 .
Some companies say they also are trying to reach that market by doing more advertising in native-language and bilingual newspapers and in English-language publications and television programs that target ethnic entrepreneurs .
Advertising revenue at Minority BusinessNews USA , a national publication for small minority suppliers , has risen an average of 34 % each year for the past four years , says Donald L. McKneely , publisher of the monthly tabloid owned by TexCorp Communications Inc. of Dallas .
Much of the publication 's advertising comes from large companies seeking minority vendors or recruits , but Mr. McKneely says he has noticed an increase in business-to-business advertising in the past year .
Not every company is segmenting its small-business sales pitches along ethnic and racial lines , of course .
Sprint Corp. , the Kansas City , Mo.-based telecommunications company , says it occasionally advertises in some ethnic publications as part of its efforts to blanket the small-business market .
But a company spokesman says Sprint does n't try to target minority-owned businesses in its sales campaigns .
Other companies target ethnic groups without tailoring their message .
Bell Atlantic Corp. , Philadelphia , which is studying new ways to reach ethnic firms , uses generic small-business advertising in Black Enterprise , Hispanic Business and Working Woman magazines .
One reason may be cost .
At Pacific Bell , for example , each native-language business center has to produce its own brochures , advertisements and other written materials , says Ms. Lum , the marketing manager .
Because each culture has its own colloquialisms and likes and dislikes , copy writers ca n't always effectively translate English into foreign languages .
Direct marketing is n't always the most direct route to the hearts and minds of ethnic business owners .
Sometimes , old-fashioned corporate goodwill can do the trick even better .
Indeed , an increasing number of companies are joining chambers of commerce , sponsoring neighborhood festivals and trade shows and even creating college scholarships for young minority students .
`` Sponsoring events builds friendships with community leaders and business leaders , who will in turn influence other business owners , '' says Eleanor Yu , president and chief executive of Adland , a San Francisco firm that specializes in marketing to Asian consumers and businesses .
`` It 's building bridges .
'' Jerry Roebuck , founder of Black Expo USA Inc. , an Atlanta company that organizes trade fairs for black-owned businesses , says he and other African-American business owners swap stories about hotels , restaurants and computer dealers , for example .
If one entrepreneur has a bad experience with a company , the other business owner may steer clear , too .
Similarly , large vendors perceived as sensitive to ethnic business communities can win entrepreneurs ' loyalties .
`` I 'm very aware of the companies that quote , unquote , are really committed to minority business , '' says Jose Montiel , president of Proftech Corp. , an Elmsford , N.Y. , office-supply distributor .
`` I specifically go out of my way to buy their products .
'' XYTRONYX Inc. -LRB- San Diego -RRB- -- Rand Mulford , 50 years old , was named to the new post of chief operating officer for this biotechnology concern , effective Sept. 18 .
He currently is chief executive of Chiron Mimotopes Peptide System L.L.C. , a joint venture of Chiron Corp. and Houghton Pharmaceuticals Inc. Xytronyx also announced that effective Jan. 1 , 1995 , Larry Bymaster , 52-year-old president and chief executive officer , will become chairman and chief executive when Peter Baram retires .
Dr. Baram , 67 , the company 's founder , will become a consultant to the company .
Mr. Mulford will assume the additional position of president at that time .
As the great walls of China tumble , more big U.S. corporations are scurrying to find bosses for their booming operations there .
The catch : Few local managers in that land of 1.2 billion boast Western business experience .
And expatriates , wary about harsh living conditions in parts of China , seek lavish compensation packages to move there .
With demand for executives outstripping supply , salary levels and job hopping are spiraling out of control in China , complains Jacques Langevin , human-resources director for Avon Products Inc. 's Asia-Pacific operation .
`` It 's the Wild West .
I mean , it 's the Wild East , '' he says .
`` China is a new frontier .
'' The talent gold rush comes amid America 's push to capture a larger share of the globe 's fastest-growing market .
Reflecting that drive , the chief executive officers of Westinghouse Electric Corp. , Eastman Kodak Co. , Federal Express Corp. , Chrysler Corp. and 20 other major companies intend to board a presidential jet Friday for a week-long `` commercial diplomacy '' mission to China with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown .
Mr. Brown hopes to grab at least $ 6 billion in infrastructure projects for U.S. businesses .
But many American multinational concerns need managers to open doors to the emerging Chinese market .
To meet this burgeoning need , five U.S. executive-search firms have recently opened or will soon open offices in China .
Korn\/Ferry International , the world 's biggest headhunting firm , says it plans to set up shop in Beijing and possibly Shanghai by year end .
Executive Access Ltd. in Hong Kong , one of Asia 's largest headhunters , says it expects to conduct between 60 and 90 China assignments for U.S. corporate clients this year , up from just a half dozen in 1991 .
The firm 's total number of China searches could reach 120 this year .
Yet even Executive Access ca n't locate enough local Chinese executives with the right mix of skills .
Ranjan Marwah , the search firm 's chief executive , says he has spent seven months fruitlessly seeking a $ 100,000-a-year agricultural manager in China for a major U.S. food producer .
The candidate must speak English and Mandarin , have business experience in China and be able to negotiate with farmers and government officials there .
`` Such a collection of experiences does n't exist at this point , '' Mr. Marwah frets .
AT&T Corp. , which has eight joint ventures and nearly 1,000 employees in China , mainly recruits local talent through word of mouth , says Francis Kwong , the company 's human-resources manager in Beijing .
Few search firms have a big enough presence in China to be effective , he notes .
`` In China , technical skills are quite easy to find .
But management skills ... are much more difficult to find , '' Mr. Kwong continues .
AT&T is now trying a different recruiting tack .
It recently dispatched nine Chinese-speaking employees from the U.S. to China in search of managers .
The temporary scouts `` know where to look '' for good prospects , says Robert E. Allen , AT&T 's chairman and chief executive .
So far , the hunt has helped to fill more than 100 positions in China , an AT&T spokeswoman says .
Besides providing contacts and knowledge of the Chinese market , indigenous managers cost multinational corporations much less than expatriates .
`` The difference in cost between an expat and local manager can be 10 to 15 times , '' observes Sam Wan , managing director of the Hong Kong office for Norman Broadbent International Inc. , a New York-based search firm .
Broadbent moved into Beijing last fall and will add a Shanghai office later this year .
Mr. Wan cites a midlevel government functionary who recently agreed to run a big Canadian company 's office in Beijing for a pay package that totaled 200,000 Hong Kong dollars -LRB- about US$ 26,000 -RRB- .
The sum was one-tenth the size of a package rejected by an American expatriate with three other job offers .
But the former bureaucrat now earns about 27 times what he had made working for the government .
A senior U.S. executive relocating to China can command an expatriate package that typically includes a hardship allowance ranging between 20 % and 35 % of base salary , free housing , frequent `` rest and relaxation '' trips to Hong Kong and a chauffeur-driven car , recruiters report .
Probably the hottest candidates for China assignments are `` bicultural '' Asian managers , typically born outside the mainland but with both Western and Asian work experience , headhunters say .
Certain bicultural executives can even get a dual-housing benefit .
During the week , they live in China in company-paid quarters .
On the weekend , they rejoin their families in Hong Kong -- where international schools and Western products are less scarce and their housing also is free .
Two executives of Colgate-Palmolive Co. enjoy that sort of arrangement .
Both work at a new toothpaste and toothbrush plant outside Guangzhou that is owned by a joint venture of Colgate and a local partner .
One executive , a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Hong Kong , was an assistant controller at Colgate 's headquarters in New York before he went to China .
When Colgate hired the second executive in 1992 , he already was living in China , apart from his family in Hong Kong .
Colgate says it never could have attracted the new hire , who was born in mainland China , without that housing perk .
Indeed , the intense demand for talent in China has provoked considerable job hopping by both local and foreign managers .
`` We 've had cases where supervisory employees worked for only a few days and then left for school in the States , '' says A&T 's Mr. Kwong .
Why ?
So they can put a blue-chip U.S. firm on their resumes .
These supervisors had arranged to attend school before joining the company -- a detail that AT&T missed during its screening , the official concedes .
Mr. Kwong himself is an example of job hopping in China 's overheated job market .
The Hong Kong native has worked for AT&T for less than a year .
He previously worked for International Business Machines Corp. in Hong Kong and Beijing .
He says several search firms approached him before he accepted AT&T 's bid .
Headhunters still call at least once a month .
ALEXANDRIA , Va. -- The United Way of America said philanthropist Walter H. Annenberg gave $ 1 million to United Way 's 1994 major gifts development plan .
United Way said the funds will be used to increase staff who work to collect contributions of more than $ 1,000 .
The United Way said Mr. Annenberg , one of its major contributors , has given $ 4 million since 1986 .
VANS Inc. -LRB- Orange , Calif. -RRB- -- Christopher G. Staff , 52 years old , has been named president and chief executive officer of this maker of casual footwear , replacing interim president and CEO Walter E. Schoenfeld .
Mr. Staff had been president and chief operating officer of the Speedo and Action Sports divisions of Van Nuys , Calif.-based Authentic Fitness Corp. , an operator of retail stores , since 1990 .
Mr. Staff will begin at Vans Sept. 16 .
Mr. Schoenfeld , 63 , was named interim president and CEO of Vans in April 1993 .
He will continue to serve on the company 's board .
He has also been named vice chairman and chairman of the executive committee .
Mr. Staff will also join the board of Vans , increasing it to seven members .
After months of performing like a bad basketball team , Newbridge Networks is proposing to do the Wall Street version of lowering the basket to guarantee its top officers an easy dunk .
Skeptics say this means Newbridge 's battered stock is n't about to rebound any time soon .
What the Kanata , Ontario , company is proposing is to slash the price at which senior officers and others can cash in certain stock options granted in 1993 and early 1994 .
Because Newbridge stock has fallen too much to give these options a reasonable chance of paying off , Newbridge wants to lower , or `` restrike , '' the options ' exercise prices to make sure that they probably do .
The telecommunications equipment maker is expected to announce fiscal first-quarter earnings today ; it has already said that those earnings , for the quarter ended July 31 , would be disappointing .
The proposed options maneuver is sure to interest any investor , not just those in Newbridge , who has suffered the pain of a plunging investment .
The details are in Newbridge 's proxy documents for its annual meeting Sept. 15 , under the unassuming title 1994 Stock Option Amendment Program .
Shareholders must approve the measure , which Newbridge 's board recommends .
The plan affects options held by senior officers and other employees to buy 2.2 million Newbridge shares .
They were originally exercisable at prices , converted to U.S. dollars on the Nasdaq Stock Market , of 32 to 63 1\/2 .
These used to be reasonable targets .
But with Newbridge stock now languishing at just under 32 , the company proposes to change the exercise price to the U.S. equivalent of just 29 starting in June 1995 .
As they used to say on `` Saturday Night Live , '' how convenient !
While Newbridge is taking steps to protect its management , a lot of outsiders have lost money betting on the company .
The stock nearly tripled in 1993 but has tumbled so far this year .
On Aug. 1 , it plunged 32 % after the company announced that its fiscal first-quarter earnings would n't meet analysts ' expectations .
The price decline was compounded by a botched trading halt on Nasdaq .
Investors have filed lawsuits over the earnings-forecast plunge , according to Newbridge , and options dealers on the Pacific Stock Exchange are still fuming over the botched halt , in which Nasdaq canceled some trades that took place because of a miscommunication about when trading would resume .
All of which makes Newbridge 's proposed option amendment a tough thing to swallow for some investors .
Michael C. Freedman of MCF Capital , a New York investor who says he holds nearly 1,000 shares , has sent a written complaint to Newbridge 's chairman , but says he has n't heard back .
`` I do n't mean to whine about the fact that the stock price has gone down , even though it 's down significantly , '' Mr. Freedman says in an interview , `` but I 'd like for those guys to take their lumps along with the rest of the shareholders .
'' Newbridge did n't respond to an interview request yesterday , but the message from the proxy documents is clear : There 's no way the stock is going back to where it was , so a new `` incentive '' level is needed .
In proposing the options amendment , the Newbridge board `` noted its belief that stock options have been important motivators of employees at all levels of the corporation in recent years during which the corporation has achieved significant increases in revenues and profitability , '' the proxy document says .
The options amendment program is designed `` to preserve this motivating effect '' by ensuring that the options `` are exercisable at prices not substantially higher than '' the current level .
In Canadian dollars , the `` amended '' options would now be exercisable at $ 40 a share .
They had been exercisable at C$ 44.05 to C$ 87.48 .
Joseph Bellace , a Merrill Lynch analyst , notes that Newbridge is n't the first company to amend such a plan .
Still , he rates the stock `` neutral , '' saying , `` There 's a pause in the growth rate .
'' A weak dollar pulled stock and bond prices lower .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered from a session low of 3737.63 to finish down 3.89 at 3751.22 , the average 's fourth-consecutive loss .
The Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index dropped 1.36 to 462.32 and the Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.14 to 742.29 .
The dollar tumbled early in the day , primarily against the yen , after more verbal sparring between the U.S. and Japan over trade issues .
The currency also lost ground against the mark as traders worried that Germany 's central bank may have finished its current round of interestrate decreases and may soon begin tightening credit , which would add to the mark 's attractiveness .
The bond market , already nervous about a two-day , $ 28.25 billion auction of Treasury notes that begins today , followed the ailing U.S. currency lower .
And the stock market , which has stubbornly followed the bond market during the past few months , tracked bonds lower .
But stock prices showed more resilience in the afternoon , recovering much of their losses while bond prices languished .
`` In terms of the flow of events , there 's no question that it started with the dollar falling on the trade-talk news , '' said David C. Munro , chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics , a New York consulting firm .
`` And it did n't take a whole lot in a summer-slowed market to squeeze things some more .
'' With bond and stock prices mired in a narrow trading range and U.S.-Japan trade talks intensifying , the dollar is a focal point for investors .
Several analysts worry that the weak dollar will contribute to inflation by raising the prices of imported goods .
Moreover , some economists worry that the Fed , ostensibly to fight inflation , could step in and raise rates yet again to support the dollar .
World-wide , stock prices rose in dollar terms .
The Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 0.08 to 118.74 .
Stock prices fell .
Volume totaled 235,867,030 shares on the New York Stock Exchange , where 1,238 issues declined and 922 advanced .
Bond prices fell .
The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year issue fell nearly 7\/8 point , or almost $ 8.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to yield 7.55 % .
The dollar dropped .
In late New York trading , the currency was quoted at 1.5278 marks and 97.85 yen , compared with 1.5396 marks and 98.70 yen Friday .
HOLLYWOOD -- News Corp. 's Twentieth Century Fox , joining the ranks of other movie studios that are ramping up production , set up a separate production unit that will make eight to 12 `` mainstream , broad-appeal '' pictures a year .
The new unit , which has n't yet been named , will be headed by Laura Ziskin , a producer of the hit movies `` Pretty Woman , '' `` No Way Out '' and `` What About Bob ?
'' She was named the division 's president .
Fox will now have two main production units that will act as `` sister divisions , '' similar to the arrangement at Walt Disney Co. , which releases mainstream movies under the Touchstone Pictures and Hollywood Pictures labels .
Fox 's existing production unit , which will release a similar number of pictures annually , will continue to be headed by Tom Jacobson .
This year Fox will release about 15 or 16 movies .
But the decision to set up an additional production arm , as well as recently established units to create family films and `` art-house '' movies , puts the studio on track to release about 30 pictures a year once the machine is up and running within a few years .
`` What we 've been grappling with over the past six months or so is to try and find the most reasonable and responsible way to increase production , '' said Peter Chernin , Fox 's chairman .
`` By concentrating on a fewer number of pictures , each of these divisions hopefully will be able to give the films the kind of care and attention they all need .
'' Reflecting conventional wisdom in Hollywood , Mr. Chernin said : `` I question whether any one production division can effectively develop more than 15 pictures a year .
'' Fox , which has had a rough couple of years , is enjoying something of a resurgence .
Two of its summer movies , `` Speed '' and `` True Lies , '' have each grossed more than $ 100 million at the box office .
Movie companies have been increasing production because there is a general feeling that as `` content providers '' they will be big winners in the coming age of the information superhighway .
What 's more , the theatrical exhibition business is strong and many are predicting significant expansion of the home-video market domestically and overseas .
Ms. Ziskin , 44 years old , comes to Fox from Sony Corp. 's movie operations , where she had an exclusive production deal , having produced the Dustin Hoffman movie `` Hero '' as well as `` To Die For , '' a picture directed by Gus Van Sant that will be released early next year .
In her new post , Ms. Ziskin said she hopes to put in place a team of creative executives that together with writers and directors will come up with fresh ideas , as opposed to simply bidding on existing scripts that are making the rounds in Hollywood .
`` We can be like everyone else and bid for the existing ` real estate ' or we can say let 's be architects and builders ourselves , '' Ms. Ziskin said .
`` If we get the right people in the room for us , the right writers and filmmakers , I think we can create some very valuable real estate on our own .
And I think it 'll be more fun .
'' ROCHESTER , N.Y. -- Curtice-Burns Foods Inc. said it would take a $ 12 million pretax charge in the fiscal first quarter to shed unprofitable businesses as part of its continuing restructuring .
Further details about the restructuring for the quarter ending Sept. 24 will be announced later , the food processor and marketer said .
Curtice-Burns currently is pursuing a takeover offer from Dean Foods Co. , Franklin Park , Ill. , which in June bid $ 172.8 million , or $ 20 a share , for the company .
But the board also is to consider an offer of $ 164.2 million , or $ 19 a share , from Pro-Fac Cooperative of Rochester , N.Y. , which is Curtice-Burns 's primary supplier of fruits and vegetables and handles all Curtice-Burns financing .
Earlier this summer , Curtice-Burns rejected an offer from Pro-Fac of $ 145.8 million , or $ 16.87 a share .
Curtice-Burns and Pro-Fac , which operate a venture that produces 21 categories of canned and frozen products , also are entering arbitration .
The Dean Foods proposal is conditioned on terminating an agreement between Pro-Fac and Curtice-Burns under which Curtice-Burns would purchase various assets owned by Pro-Fac and used by Curtice-Burns , as well as settling other issues between the companies .
Among other issues , Pro-Fac has claimed a right to half of the net proceeds from the sale of Curtice-Burns stock and has claimed that Curtice-Burns tried to terminate obligations to purchase crops in violation of a pact between the two companies .
For the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 25 , Curtice-Burns reported net income of $ 551,000 , or six cents a share , including a nonrecurring charge of $ 3.8 million , or 20 cents a share , due to nontax-deductible expenses related to the potential sale of the company .
In the year-earlier quarter , the company had a loss of $ 28 million , or $ 3.25 a share , including nonrecurring charges of $ 58.9 million , or $ 3.36 a share , related to restructuring .
Sales fell 12 % to $ 186.3 million from $ 212 million .
In trading yesterday on the American Stock Exchange , Curtice closed unchanged at $ 17.50 .
WILLIAMS-SONOMA Inc. -LRB- San Francisco -RRB- -- Russell E. Solt , 46 years old , was named senior vice president and chief financial officer , succeeding James E. Riley , 56 , who will assume new duties as senior vice president , systems and administration , for the kitchenware retailer .
Mr. Solt had been chief financial officer for Belk Stores , a chain of retail department stores based in Charlotte , N.C. .
The company said the change was made as a `` realignment of responsibilities '' tied to a new growth phase .
DENVER -- Firefighters and their commanders violated eight of 10 standard firefighting rules in the July 6 wildfire on Storm King Mountain near Glenwood Springs , Colo. , that killed 14 firefighters , according to a report released by a government investigating team .
The interagency team also said the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service crews at the fire that day continued to fight the blaze even though at least a dozen standard warning signs , or `` Watch Out Situations , '' indicated that it was unsafe .
The team , made up of Bureau of Land Management , Forest Service and National Weather Service personnel , did n't blame any individual for the deaths , but maintained that the fatalities resulted from `` a series of judgments , decisions and actions with serious cumulative impacts .
'' No disciplinary actions were recommended .
At a news conference , the investigative team 's leaders tried to negate weekend news reports that the investigation showed firefighters were `` overzealous '' in fighting the fire .
Although a `` Monday morning quarterback '' might judge the fire too dangerous to fight , the firefighters on the line `` made tough decisions , '' said Les Rosenkrance , director of the Arizona state office of the BLM .
Nevertheless , among the 24 factors that the investigators said contributed to the fatalities was the `` can-do attitude of supervisors and firefighters '' that led them to ignore rules and overlook red flags .
Other contributing factors were poor communication of escape routes , weather forecasts and safe zones to the firefighters ; a lack of fire-behavior analysis ; poor choice for an escape route ; a lack of understanding about the fuel in the fire ; inadequate air support ; firefighters ' failure to shed their tools and packs in their escape ; and in the case of one firefighter , fatigue from working too many long days in a row .
The investigators made 20 recommendations , including a proposal that the nation 's firefighting agencies `` strengthen sensitivity to basic safety standards .
'' The team also recommended more training , better guidelines for the use of emergency shelters and better communication of weather forecasts to firefighting crews .
CDI Corp. -LRB- Philadelphia -RRB- -- Walter Blankley was elected a director of this technical-services and management-recruitment company .
Mr. Blankley is chairman and chief executive officer of Ametek Inc. , a manufacturer of products used in electromechanical devices , precision instruments and industrial materials .
The addition of Mr. Blankley gives the board nine members .
SUNBEAM-OSTER Co. -LRB- Fort Lauderdale , Fla. -RRB- -- James J. Clegg was named to the new position of president and chief operating officer , North America , of this consumer-products company .
Mr. Clegg , 42 years old , had been president of the company 's household-products group .
Spencer J. Volk , 60 , currently president of Sunbeam-Oster 's international group , was given the additional title of chief operating officer , international .
Both men will report directly to the company 's chairman and chief executive , Roger W. Schipke , as part of a realignment of Sunbeam-Oster 's business operations .
Richard Boynton , 40 , was named president of the household-products group , succeeding Mr. Clegg .
Mr. Boynton had been the group 's vice president-sales and marketing .
APPLE BANK FOR SAVINGS -LRB- New York -RRB- -- William J. Laraia , chairman and chief executive officer , resigned to pursue `` new opportunities , '' the bank said .
Mr. Laraia , 58 years old , will be succeeded by Alan Shamoon , 43 , the bank 's chief operating officer and chief financial officer .
Mr. Laraia took the top job in early 1991 soon after the bank was purchased by Stanley Stahl , a real-estate developer , through a tender offer .
Apple , a thrift that had grown into a commercial bank prior to Mr. Stahl 's acquisition , returned to its traditional role as a residential real-estate lender under Mr. Laraia 's leadership .

This is the starting point for a bicycle tour called Ride Around Mount Rainier in One Day , a mouthful that nicely compresses into the acronym Ramrod .
Rainier is just visible over a nearby hill , its 14,410-foot summit glowing in the late-dawn sun nearly three vertical miles above us .
The ride , in its 10th year , is one of the toughest nonprofessional contests in the country , following a counterclockwise circuit 156 miles around the mountain and climbing three passes in Mount Rainier National Park for an overall elevation gain of 9,000 feet .
The park service limits Ramrod to 750 bicyclists , and the $ 55 tickets are issued in a lottery .
Away we go .
Enumclaw 's finest have marked off intersections with flares , and cheerfully wave us through .
Almost at once we duck under a blanket of damp fog .
Within a few miles , two fire trucks and an aid car partially block the road .
A bad sign .
On a stretcher lies a bloodied but alive cyclist , victim of a local unaccustomed to pulling out of his driveway on a Thursday morning and finding rows of cyclists blasting past .
Ramrod is billed as a hill climb , but there 's a 60-mile prologue through rolling farmland and past small lakes edged with summer homes .
Because of the easy terrain here , nearly everyone with a shred of vanity throws caution to the wind and rides too fast .
So when a tandem bicycle cruises past at 22 miles an hour , I yell to my friend Dave , `` Let 's follow these guys , '' and speed up to benefit from the generous slipstream the big two-person bike provides .
Call me vain .
I 've lost Dave already .
Mount Rainier National Park is an island surrounded by private and Forest Service land .
At the park entrance , marked by a massive log arch , one has the sensation of entering another world .
The marginally productive farms and espresso stands that line Highway 706 suddenly give way to deep , open groves of Douglas fir , Western red cedar and hemlock , sprouting from a carpet of ferns and mosses .
We 've been riding in bright sunshine for the past hour , but now I can barely see the shaded two-lane road through my sunglasses .
The road tilts upward , and I reflect for a moment on the 19.4 mile-an-hour average I 've carried to here , well above my usual .
No sign yet of `` bonk , '' the combination of fatigue and low blood sugar that is the bicyclist 's bane .
Professional bicyclists call anything that tastes good `` recreational food , '' unsuitable for consumption during competition .
We recreational riders are n't so choosy , and Ramrod organizers have stocked the food stops with mounds of fruit , bagels slathered with peanut butter and jelly , and cookies .
Rainier glistens above through a broad opening in the forest cut in 1947 by a massive mud flow .
These flows , not eruptions , are what make Rainier a dangerous peak .
Geologists call it a `` composite volcano , '' which means it consists of lasagnalike layers of volcanic ash , lava and general rubble .
Melting snow and ice can lubricate the whole mess .
Serious climbing now , 2,000 feet an hour , according to my wrist altimeter .
I 'm feeling pretty chipper , though , and as we labor over the Nisqually Bridge , I offer a fellow sufferer the information that a century ago the Nisqually Glacier , now out of sight two miles upslope , extended to the location of the bridge before retreating due to climate change .
My thanks for this fascinating tidbit is a glacial glare .
Sheesh .
I 've reached Paradise , 5,400 feet in elevation , the main lodge and visitor center in the park .
We 're at treeline , and can see the whole mass of the enormous mountain rising above us and to either side .
I recollect the aphorism that having a wish granted may be one 's worst possible fate .
I had hoped for clear , sunny weather and have had my request answered .
The road to Cayuse Pass , the last high point , is relentless and sun-whipped .
I 'm uncertain whether the pass crests at 4,800 or 4,300 feet , and as I stare at my altimeter slowly creeping toward 4,000 , I lobby heavily for the lower figure .
Of course , it turns out to be the higher .
At the Silver Springs food stop just outside the park boundary , the plastic buckets filled with ice and Cokes and piles of sandwiches remind me of how disgusted I am with energy bars , the synth-food one needs when burning 6,000 calories in a day .
I 've eaten four of them , in addition to real food at the rest stops .
In the shade next to me a knot of cyclists chow down .
One surveys the heap of bicycles carelessly tossed down by butt-sore riders .
`` I wonder what the value of all this rolling stock is ?
'' he asks .
From the high percentage of carbon-fiber , titanium and hand-welded Italian steel in evidence , I 'd say easily $ 2,000 a copy , times 100 or so .
Forty miles to go , and all gently downhill .
On the other hand , the long canyon we descend is blasted by headwinds of 25 miles an hour .
Ten of us form a pace line , switching off taking the brunt of the wind while the rest of the riders tuck in behind , centipede-like .
Four miles to go .
Suddenly I hear a hiss just below me .
A flat .
I say a bad word .
The fairgrounds loom on the right , and I pull into the rope chute .
Finished .
I change into blissfully dry shorts and a clean T-shirt , then drive upcourse to find Dave , who is still 90 minutes from the finish .
That gives me plenty of time for a plate of rice , beans and enchiladas at a local Mexican restaurant , all washed down with a cold beer .
I recall a recent newspaper article criticizing such fare , then ask for a side of sour cream .
Recreational food , indeed .

TWINSBURG , Ohio -- General Computer Corp. said it had entered into `` serious '' but `` very preliminary '' discussions with potential buyers regarding a possible business combination .
General Computer , which had sales of $ 16.6 million in the fiscal year ended May 31 , did not put a value on the combination or identify any potential buyers .
The designer and marketer of computer systems and services for the retail pharmacy industry said it retained the firm Carleton , McCreary , Holmes & Co. of Cleveland as its financial adviser .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading , General Computer fell $ 1.50 , or 14 % , to $ 9 after jumping $ 1.75 on Friday .
The company also posted a loss of $ 1.9 million , or $ 1.05 a share , for the fiscal fourth quarter , including charges of $ 1.7 million , or 93 cents a share , for costs related to legal fees in two pending lawsuits .
In the first lawsuit , the company was sued in Cuyahoga County , Ohio , Court of Common Pleas in February by James J. Mindala , a former executive who charged the company `` improperly calculated its income and overstated the amount of its revenues .
'' The second lawsuit is related to General Computer 's restatement in April of its results for the first two quarters of fiscal 1994 .
The company , blaming incorrect accounting in its managed-care drug-formulatory program , said it had losses instead of profits in those quarters .
Two shareholders filed a suit in U.S. District Court in Cleveland , contending that company officials knew of financial irregularities earlier than they had disclosed them .
General Computer said it had not made a provision for possible settlement or awards in the lawsuits .
The fourth-quarter charges also include amounts that would be due if the company terminated its contract to build a corporate headquarters .
In the year-earlier fourth quarter , General Computer had net income of $ 213,000 , or 11 cents a share .
For the fiscal year ended May 31 , the company reported a net loss of $ 3.8 million , or $ 2.08 a share , compared with a profit of $ 800,000 , or 43 cents a share , in fiscal 1993 .

The defendants were charged with filing false applications to obtain loans of as much as $ 405,000 each .
Among the false filings were copies of doctored income-tax returns , which `` greatly overstated '' the actual incomes of the businesses , according to the indictments .
