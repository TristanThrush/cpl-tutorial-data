TOKYO -- Tokyo Electric Power Co. announced plans to build a large soccer training center in Fukushima Prefecture .
But the utility denied that the plan has anything to do with its request to build two new nuclear reactors in the same region .
Tokyo Electric said it would build a `` National Training Center '' for soccer players that would include a 5,000-seat grandstand , a practice field and hotel , among other things .
The soccer facility , in the suburbs of Iwaki , is likely to cost Tokyo Electric about 13 billion yen -LRB- $ 132 million -RRB- , a spokesman said .
The training center would give a big push to Japan 's bid to invite the 2002 World Cup , according to officials of the Football Association of Japan .
But on the same day it announced the soccer-center plans , the utility applied for permission to install two more nuclear reactors at its No. 1 Fukushima nuclear power plant , which straddles the towns of Okuma and Futaba .
The proposed reactors would make Fukushima Prefecture , on Japan 's Pacific coast , the largest single prefectural source of nuclear energy , with a generating capacity of 11.81 million kilowatts , replacing Fukui Prefecture .
A group of Fukushima citizens calling for increased safety at nuclear power plants oppose the Tokyo Electric plan to install new reactors .
CHICAGO -- Amoco Corp. said its Amoco Trinidad Oil Co. unit discovered natural gas 45 miles off the east coast of Trinidad .
A testing program is under way to determine the potential of the East Mayaro 3 discovery well , Amoco said .
The first of the tests produced 20 million cubic feet of gas a day at a depth of 13,500 feet .
Amoco has a 100 % interest in the well .
Crude-oil prices sank amid slowing demand at U.S. refineries .
Light , sweet crude for delivery in October slid 64 cents to $ 16.90 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Since hitting a peak above $ 20 a barrel in July , crude-oil prices have declined steadily .
Robert Boslego , president of oil analyst Boslego Corp. in Burlington , Mass. , attributes crude 's weakness in part to seasonal changes in demand .
`` Utilization at refineries has peaked , '' he said .
`` And once you get past the peak period for crude refining , you get a downturn in demand for crude , which is a negative for crude prices .
'' Easing worries about Nigerian crude supplies also depressed prices again yesterday , analysts said .
The oil market has been buffeted since July 4 by news about striking oil workers in Nigeria .
At first , prices shot higher in anticipation of a cutoff , or slowdown , in Nigerian oil exports .
But when it became evident that those fears might be overblown , prices swung lower .
George Ellis , a trader at GSC Energy in Atlanta , a division of Grain Service Corp. , said growing confidence that Nigerian production wo n't be disrupted severely is helping to push down prices .
`` Under martial law in Nigeria , oil is going to be produced , '' Mr. Ellis said .
`` Production is not going to stop , because oil is the driving force behind the economy .
'' But Mr. Ellis added that he believes the turmoil in Nigeria is far from over , and further jolts to the oil market are likely as the strike plays out .
`` Just as the market overreacted on the upside , the market is overreacting on the downside , '' Mr. Ellis said .
`` We 'll hear about Nigeria again before year end .
'' Yesterday 's drop in gasoline prices , spurred by worries about hefty supplies , also put pressure on crude , Mr. Ellis said .
`` We went from a shortage to a fair amount of surplus , which translates into less demand for crude , '' Mr. Ellis said .
Unleaded regular gasoline for September delivery fell 2.75 cents to $ 51.45 cents a gallon .
Rising interest rates are another factor taking a toll on oil , analysts said .
Since February , the Federal Reserve has boosted short-term rates five times in an effort to slow the economy and stave off inflation .
A slower economy raises the prospect of weaker demand for oil-and lower crude prices .
`` The increase in interest rates is negative for the gross domestic product , and GDP correlates very highly with petroleum-products demand , '' Mr. Boslego said .
And once the downward trend is in place , it tends to feed on itself , he added .
With crude off about $ 3 from its peak in July , `` when you get negative news , it has a reinforcing effect and destabilizes prices even further , '' he said .
Even so , prices are n't likely to head much lower , Mr. Boslego said .
And he does n't expect crude to slip back to its March lows .
`` There 's a little more downside , but it 's probably getting close to the lower end of the range , '' he said .
CROPS & LIVESTOCK : Prices of soybean futures contracts slipped in the wake of beneficial weekend rains in parched sections of Illinois , Indiana and Ohio .
In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade , the soybean contract for September delivery dropped 8.25 cents a bushel to settle at $ 5.745 a bushel .
Most corn prices settled unchanged because the Midwest crop has matured past the point when rain is the most crucial .
Before the weekend rain , dry weather had eroded soybean conditions in some Midwest states .
U.S. soybean farmers in a weekly survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture rated 71 % of their fields in good to excellent condition last week , down from 79 % the previous week .
Corn farmers rated 81 % of their crop in good to excellent condition , down from 83 % the previous week .
Some crop analysts expect rainy weather this week to improve field conditions .
After the close of trading , the National Weather Service released a six-to-10-day forecast for normal to above-normal precipitation across the Midwest .
In other farm markets , cattle prices sank at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the wake of a monthly feedlot survey released by the Agriculture Department after the close of trading Friday .
The agency reported that 7.37 million cattle were being fattened Aug. 1 by feedlots in the seven major ranch states , down 3 % from a year earlier .
Traders had expected the inventory to shrink even more in large part because a summer plunge in cattle prices has left many feedlots unprofitable .
In trading yesterday , the live cattle contract for October delivery dropped its daily permissible limit of 1.5 cents a pound to settle at 70.2 cents a pound .
COPPER : Copper prices drifted lower in thin trading for the third day in a row as speculators opted to exit holdings ahead of the expiration of September contracts early next month .
In trading on the Comex division of the New York Merc , copper for September delivery fell 1.7 cents to $ 1.0670 a pound .
Analysts said the selling pressure also reflected seasonal weakness in demand for copper among industrial users , which has led to higher stockpiles on the London Metal Exchange and on New York 's Comex .
`` This is just a case of the summer doldrums , when purchasing managers go on holiday , '' said Fred Demler , metals economist at ED&F Man , a New York commodity brokerage firm .
Large commodity funds and other speculators had bought copper on the bet that prices would continue to climb , perhaps exceeding the contract high of $ 1.1690 a pound set last month , Mr. Demler said .
`` When they saw that was n't going to materialize in the next week or so , they decided to exit , '' he added .
Most analysts continue to argue that copper 's fundamentals remain strong , and that revived demand in the fourth quarter could lead to higher prices .
TECH DATA Corp. -LRB- Clearwater , Fla. -RRB- -- Daniel M. Doyle , 53 years old , was added to the board of this computer-products distributor , bringing the number of directors to seven .
Mr. Doyle is co-founder and chief executive of office-equipment supplier Danka Industries Inc. , a unit of Danka Business Systems PLC , London .
Last Wednesday , the editorial page featured yet another poorly informed , inaccurate critique of the Clinton administration 's agenda for change -LRB- `` Andrew Cuomo , Big Spender , '' Aug. 17 -RRB- .
This time the writer managed to get every major fact precisely wrong while ignoring all information that contradicted his `` big spender '' theory .
The real facts : During the last year my office at the Department of Housing and Urban Development has assumed additional responsibility for a wide variety of innovative Clinton administration initiatives .
These include the selection of empowerment zones and communities and the development of the new Federal Plan on Homelessness .
My office has executed these new duties within the overall HUD budget -- and with a staff that is 45 % smaller than it was when Ronald Reagan was president .
In fact , with less staff my office will this year administer programs that are 25 % larger than last year 's initiatives .
The alleged `` expensive '' Housing and Community Development Conference criticized in the piece was actually a great success ; it brought together over 2,000 neighborhood representatives from across America and was an important part of our work to restore the broken connections between our government and our people .
Ironically , the national conference began as a Republican proposal which this administration drastically scaled back in cost and expanded in scope -- resulting in a total per-person conference cost that was 13 times less than the cost proposed by the previous administration .
This fact was conveniently omitted from the piece .
The writer wrongly alleged that money from poverty programs has been transferred for salaries and travel -- despite the fact that he received a memorandum from a career budget official verifying that no such money had ever been transferred .
The facts are clear , yet they were ignored .
Why ?
Because some have chosen to use deception and hyperbole to fight our agenda for change .
I am proud that this administration is seeking to double the amount of money devoted to homelessness , from $ 800 million to $ 1.6 billion per year .
I am even prouder that we are devising new and innovative ways to spend these resources , so that the ineffective programs of the last administrations are not perpetuated into the next century .
Our new homeless strategy will convert six different federal programs into one and keep the federal government out of local decision-making .
Just as important , our strategy will insist that homeless Americans assume personal responsibility for their own lives .
This ethic of obligation and responsibility is at the heart of all that we will do to end homelessness .
If fighting to double funding for the homeless and spending this money in new , more effective ways is the sin of a `` big spender , '' then it is a sin to which I proudly plead guilty .
During my 30-odd years in law enforcement , I watched in wonder as one presidential administration after another promised to reduce crime and drug use in America .
The wonder is that after the failures of past federal wars against poverty , crime and drugs the public still believes that Washington politicians can cure local crime problems .
In 1967 , in the Johnson administration , the Safe Streets and Crime Act carried a $ 50 million budget .
The Great Society programs , also held up as a way of reducing crime , cost billions .
Under the Nixon administration , more billions were dispensed through the Law Enforcement Assistance Act and other legislation .
Crime prevention funding continued in the Reagan administration and soared during the Bush administration .
However , the crime bill being considered by the Senate this week is the biggest of all .
And the chances that it will significantly reduce crime are small .
Federal programs are less effective than local programs in part because they receive less scrutiny .
Mandates and federal cash come down from above in the form of `` free '' money that a city council is unlikely to turn down , regardless of its effect .
Locally funded programs , on the other hand , have to compete for funds with schools , libraries and garbage collection , and so get looked at much more closely .
If something does n't work , the money is more likely to be diverted elsewhere .
Moreover , typical federal programs are evaluated only by people with a vested interest in them .
Too often , funding continues despite manifest failure .
One federally funded crime program I encountered as police chief of San Jose , Calif. , shows how some celebrated anticrime programs can actually increase violent crime in the name of crime prevention .
The Alternatives to Incarceration project funded college educations for prison inmates at San Jose State University during the 1970s and 1980s .
Only the few people running the program were aware that the project sent a number of rapists to live at the university instead of finishing their sentences in prison .
I learned that rapists had been relocated after a series of rapes around the university led us to deploy some very brave policewomen in a decoy operation .
What we found raised the hair on the back of my neck .
Night after night , convicted violent felons routinely stalked women on dark streets in the vicinity of the university in downtown San Jose .
When I complained , the project director said the `` clients '' were screened and that California had declared it an exemplary program .
Actually , we later found that the program screened applicants only on the basis of academic scores .
Federal rules prevented consideration of their criminal records .
And California had declared the program exemplary only because it submitted quarterly reports on time .
When my complaints about the program became public , I was censured by the students and faculty and advised by my superiors in city hall to go easy .
After all , this was an exemplary , federally funded program to reduce recidivism .
All of that changed a few months later when we arrested an honor student in the program for brutally torturing , raping and murdering two women near the university .
He was articulate and the project had often used him to show how wonderful it was that bright people could get a college education instead of languishing in prison .
Ironically , during the project 's 10-year existence , not one `` client '' ever graduated from the university , but a number had been arrested for crimes against women .
There is no telling how many similarly disastrous experiments are lurking in the crime bill being passed in such politically inspired haste .
The worst thing about the crime bill is that it subsidizes inefficient law enforcement .
In a calmer environment , questions would be asked about priorities -- about the wisdom of building more prisons when 60 % of those in federal prison and almost as many in state institutions are locked up for nonviolent crime .
Why is adding tens of thousands of new police necessary when so many of the existing police are wasted on desk duties , nonviolent drug arrests or other work not related to serious crime ?
How would law enforcement leaders explain the 535,000 arrests a year for marijuana crimes when the public fear of violence is unparalleled ?
The bill 's method of funding the additional police is sloppy in a manner characteristic of federal allocations -- the money is to come from savings from a hoped-for reduction in the federal work force .
Even that questionable source provides for only two or three years of seed money .
Afterward , local funding will be required or the police forces will be cut back .
Another federalizing feature of the bill is the establishment of more than 50 federal death penalties .
Few experts believe that federal death penalties will deter crime .
I have spoken off the record to a number of federal judges , from the most liberal to the most conservative , and they dread the passage of the crime bill .
Federal courts are already overburdened .
Giving them the incredibly time-consuming and costly responsibility of new capital punishment cases will produce a gridlock that will inevitably affect local courts .
It would be much better for the nation to think more about the drug and crime problems and not simply throw money at them .
While assault weapons should be banned , the ban should n't be at the price of a $ 30 billion boondoggle .
It would behoove the Senate to emulate the tough decision-making of local politicians who have to allocate a fixed sum of money among competing services .
That process would eliminate many of the fanciful notions found in federal crime control .

More Americans are having meatless meals more often -- which is food for thought for some big companies .
`` It 's kind of a diet and lifestyle change that 's very broad-based , '' says Dennis Ready , director of strategic brand development at Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Pillsbury unit .
`` We 're very excited .
'' Last year , the company launched a line of vegetable patties called Green Giant Harvest Burgers and plans to expand them to supermarkets nationwide in October .
The Green Giant burgers will have plenty of competition .
Once confined to the bran-laden shelves of health-food stores , meatless entrees are now finding a niche in mainstream grocery stores : For example , supermarket sales of frozen imitation-meat products such as `` sausage '' links and `` chicken '' patties grew 26 % to $ 39 million in the year ended July 9 , according to A.C. Nielsen Co. .
There are only about 12 million self-professed vegetarians who shun all meat , but companies believe the vegetarian pitch appeals to any nutrition-conscious consumer concerned about the fat and cholesterol content of red meat .
In fact , more than three quarters of Americans eat meatless meals twice a week , according to a survey by HealthFocus Inc. , a market-research firm in Des Moines , Iowa .
The monthly Vegetarian Times magazine says its circulation doubled in two years to 340,000 in 1993 , in part because part-time vegetarians started buying the publication .
One of the legions of part-time vegetarians is Michael Deadder , a 28-year-old New York banker who goes without meat about once a week .
On those days , he typically devours a veggie burger made of soybeans , which he believes is more healthful than his favorite beef burger .
`` It makes me feel better , '' he says .
Going after the meatless market , Nestle SA 's frozen-food division introduced four new vegetable entrees in its Stouffer 's Lean Cuisine line last year , including Classic Cheese Lasagna and Three-Bean Chili with Rice .
In fact , 14 out of 67 varieties of the Lean Cuisine dinners are meatless , says a Nestle spokeswoman .
The company only promotes them as such in vegetarian magazines but hopes to attract part-time vegetarians as well .
Says a Nestle spokeswoman : `` We 're trying to catch the wave .
'' Other marketers are hawking `` chicken free '' instant ramen noodles and vegetarian baked beans .
Even a celebrity is taking advantage of the trend : Linda McCartney , wife of rock star Paul McCartney , introduced to the U.S. in April a line of frozen dinners called Linda McCartney 's Home Style Cooking Meatless Entrees .
`` We see the real opportunities in the mainstream consumers , '' says Nate Morris , marketing consultant for Fairmont Foods of Minnesota Inc. , which is making the product line under license .
The company , which plans to market the line nationwide this year , expects 1994 sales to total $ 5 million .
But appealing to part-time vegetarians is a tricky issue because they want dishes that taste good , look good and are nutritious at the same time .
If a meatless product has much fat content , delectable though it may be , `` I might as well eat a piece of grilled chicken , '' says Jeff Turrentine , a 25-year-old `` on-and-off '' vegetarian in New York .
But Mr. Turrentine says he avoids all tofu-based meatless products because he once bought a tofu frank with low fat content that had a mushy texture and a `` battleship-gray color .
'' Certainly , cutting meat from a meal does n't automatically make it healthful .
While soy burgers and other meat substitutes tend to be low in fat , some meatless products are still relatively high in fat and calories .
`` You 've got to read the label carefully , '' says Kathleen Zelman , a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association .
`` You can easily make a meatless meal just as decadent as meat meals .
'' For example , Linda McCartney 's Spaghetti Milano contains 17 grams of fat per serving , and more than 30 % of the product 's calories come from fat .
It does n't even come close to the U.S. government 's definition of a low-fat product , which must have less than 10 % of its calories from fat .
Larry McGuire , Fairmont Foods ' chief executive officer , says the company wo n't lower the product 's fat content for fear of sacrificing taste .
`` If consumers do n't like the taste , they 'll never buy it again , '' even if it 's healthful , Mr. McGuire says .
He adds that the dinners still have less fat than if they had meat in them .
Worthington Foods Inc. , a health-food marketer based in Worthington , Ohio , is expanding its product line to try to cover all the bases .
To appeal to the health-conscious , it developed a product called Prime Patties , an imitation hamburger , which has 30 % less fat than the company 's older version , Grillers .
It has also added products like Chik Patties -- imitation , breaded `` chicken breast '' patties with higher fat content .
All the new products wo n't put much of a dent in meat sales because many part-time vegetarians say they plan to continue eating meat on a regular basis .
`` Every once in a while , I have a craving for a juicy steak , '' says Linda Recupero , a 33-year-old public-relations company employee .
But Ms. Recupero says she does n't eat meat two days in a row because it 's too heavy on her stomach .
On her meatless days , she dines on pasta , rice , or a raw cucumber or tomato , which she says are easier to prepare than meat .
And she welcomes the new vegetarian products , which are easier to prepare than chopping vegetables .
But the vegetable content in the Green Giant 's Harvest Burgers may disappoint Ms. Recupero .
Despite the familiar picture of the Green Giant on the package that brings to mind a variety of chunky vegetables , the product , manufactured by Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. , does n't contain many recognizable vegetables .
The main ingredients include soy protein concentrate , corn gluten and beet powder .
Pillsbury says that adding bits of vegetables , while more nutritious , would interfere with the meat-like texture the company is striving to attain .
It stresses that the burgers are low in fat and include protein .
Pillsbury is convinced that meatless foods have a bright future and is even offering spicy Italian - and Southwestern-style vegetable patties .
It is also trying to cook up the next generation of patties : a veggie burger with a higher fat content to make it juicy enough for the barbecue .
Goya 's work is so diverse he seems to have existed in multiple .
There is the realist Goya and the romantic Goya .
There is the Goya who turned homely aristocrats into the height of elegance and Goya the political activist , whose `` Third of May , 1808 '' is more eye-catching than any headline .
But the `` small '' Goya ?
The idea of an exhibition devoted to Goya 's diminutive paintings might sound like something cooked up by an insurance company , a way to ship and insure an old master for a fraction of the usual cost .
`` Goya : Truth and Fantasy , the Small Paintings , '' at the Art Institute of Chicago , turns out to be a delectable show .
Jointly organized by the Prado in Madrid and the Royal Academy of Arts in London , the exhibition features 80 paintings that offer up , if not a retrospective , then at least an improbable creature -- the cute Goya , his famously intense fantasies played out in miniature , almost toylike dimensions .
-LRB- The show , now at its last stop , remains up until Oct. 16 .
-RRB- It is commonly said of Goya that he was the first truly modern artist , rejecting the decorum and serenity of 18th-century Spain in favor of a more inward approach .
While he started out as a court painter specializing in rococo pastorals , it is the middle-aged Goya -- the Goya who went deaf at the age of 47 and etched the credible monsters of his `` Caprichos '' -- who tends to strike a chord with contemporary viewers .
He is cherished for his slide into darkness , the shift that led him to exchange his royalist leanings for something more private , as if in siding with pure sensibility he somehow connected not only with his own feelings , but with the democratic universe of our feelings , too .
Yet perhaps we have been neglectful of Goya 's early work , which is often viewed as rococo fluff .
In Chicago , it steals the show , transporting us to a little world of its own .
Here , the people carry parasols and wear buckled shoes , and have nothing to do with their time except stroll the countryside , munch on purple grapes or gather on a riverbank for a game of blindman 's buff .
These are not exactly urgent activities , yet Goya has made the people in the pictures seem so alive as individuals that I found myself wondering what they were saying to each other .
Somehow you suspect it 's interesting .
These works were mostly done in the 1780s as tapestry designs for the royal palace .
Carlos III , the heir to the Spanish throne , requested paintings of light-hearted subjects , and Goya delivered .
He cranked out the requisite picturesque charm , yet even so could n't conceal his daunting skills as a portraitist .
Consider `` A Woman and Two Children by a Fountain '' -LRB- 1786 -RRB- , a quietly marvelous tapestry sketch that 's just over a foot high .
Never has such a simple scene -- a mother and her two sons pausing on a country road to fill a couple of jugs with water -- seemed more psychologically astute .
The two brothers are worlds apart .
The older one is shown from the back , a dashing figure in boots and sombrero who 's resting a jug against his thigh .
But his younger brother , clumsy in his bulky coat , is having a tantrum , presumably because he 's too young to carry his own jug .
Even in this quick study , Goya has captured the world 's basic injustice in the particular feelings of a privileged firstborn and a frustrated younger sibling .
For those who prefer their Goya raw , there 's plenty to go around in Chicago .
In the middle room of the show , we come upon the amazing `` tinplates '' -- a series of 14 pictures on tin that were painted around 1793 , when the artist was recuperating from the near-fatal infection -LRB- apparently a form of polio -RRB- that left him deaf .
These small scenes convey a colossal despair .
As we watch their subjects progress from the showy pleasures of the bullfight to more lugubrious motifs , we are made to feel that something essential is being extinguished , if not human possibility itself .
In `` Interior of a Prison , '' seven inmates in chains and manacles stare indifferently into space , oppressed as much by their pointless fates as by the thickening shadows that loom around them .
Unlike the tinplate paintings , many of the other works in the show are studies for larger pieces .
This mix is problematic , since nothing unites them except their size -- and smallness , it turns out , is really an almost irrelevant consideration in the career of an artist whose small paintings echo his prints and larger paintings rather than delineate a separate set of concerns .
Perhaps that 's why the show has a grab-bag feeling , offering up an array of little treasures that lack a larger context .
Ironically , the exhibition is less memorable as a self-contained experience than as a foil to a second show , the splendid retrospective of works by Odilon Redon that is also at the Art Institute -LRB- it was reviewed in this space on Aug. 2 -RRB- .
Goya died in exile in Bordeaux in 1828 .
Redon was born there 12 years later .
Redon looked to Goya for inspiration , and found in the older painter 's `` Caprichos '' license to explore his own anguish .
So too , Goya helped lead Redon away from the sun-dappled surfaces of impressionism and down toward a netherworld of shadow , that haunted terrain where black and white are all .
Goya was a greater artist than Redon , and has little to gain from being seen side by side with his eccentric French follower .
Yet Redon gains immeasurably from the juxtaposition , in part because we can better understand the sources of his nocturnal imagery ; and his grasp of artistic antecedents is what gives his work its under-the-skin intensity .
Together the two exhibitions are a tour de force of romantic sensibility , and make the Art Institute the capital of dreams as the rest of the art world quietly slumbers through the summer .
Canon Inc. said its unconsolidated pretax profit jumped 84 % in 1994 's first half to 28.54 billion yen -LRB- $ 291.7 million -RRB- , exceeding its estimate for a 74 % gain .
The Tokyo maker of cameras , copiers and computer equipment said that overall sales rose 3.8 % to 512.68 billion yen , and sales of bubble-jet printers were particularly strong .
The profit improvement was partly attributed to a cost-cutting program .
But the company said the strong yen -- which hurts exports by making them more expensive -- threatens to hold back profits in the second half .
Canon managed to book 3.47 billion yen in profit from foreign-currency dealings in the first half , much higher than the 970 million yen in such profit it made in the year-earlier period .
GIBSON GREETINGS Inc. -LRB- Cincinnati -RRB- -- Moody 's Investors Service said it placed the Prime-2 commercial-paper rating of this company under review for potential downgrade .
Moody 's said the move was prompted by Gibson 's announcement last week that it posted a second-quarter and six-month loss .
Gibson , a designer and maker of greeting cards , gift wrapping paper and related specialty products , is expected to file restated financial results for 1993 and first-half 1994 by the end of August .
Gibson has said it believes its actual 1993 results were about 20 % less than previously reported .
GENERAL MOTORS Corp. -LRB- Detroit -RRB- -- The General Motors Acceptance Corp. unit of this auto maker said it will exercise its option to purchase the remainder of the GMAC 1992-G Grantor Trust , which was worth $ 25 million as of July 21 and represented less than 2 % of the original amount financed .
The transaction will result in the termination of all outstanding GMAC 1992-G Grantor Trust 4.30 % asset-backed certificates due to mature Nov. 15 .
The certificates will be purchased at $ 18.1957778 per $ 1,000 face amount , plus accrued interest from Aug. 15 to , but not including , Sept. 15 .
A total of $ 1,303,492,661 of Class A certificates were sold to the public in November 1992 .
WILLIAMS Cos. -LRB- Tulsa , Okla. -RRB- -- Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group said it placed several debt issues of this pipeline , natural gas and telecommunications company on CreditWatch with positive implications .
About $ 1.7 billion of debt is affected .
S&P said its action reflects Williams 's decision to sell its WilTel Network Services telecommunications subsidiary to LDDS Communications Inc. for $ 2.5 billion .
The potential for higher ratings is tied directly to management 's use of the proceeds , the ratings agency said .
Upon consummation of the transaction , Williams is expected to be left with about $ 1.6 billion in cash after taxes .
Management has already said that up to $ 800 million of Williams 's common stock will be repurchased over the next 12 months .
The remaining proceeds will be used to pay down debt , finance spending on existing businesses and fund acquisitions in the energy and telecommunications areas .
S&P said it placed on CreditWatch Williams 's triple-B-minus senior unsecured debt and its double-B-plus preferred stock , its Northwest Pipeline Corp. 's triple-B senior debt , and its Williams Natural Gas Co. 's triple-B senior debt and triple-B-minus preferred stock .
It was a heady time for environmentalists .
In 1991 , the Texas Legislature rushed to pass a flurry of bills designed to protect Texas air , water and public health .
By one count , a staggering 129 environmental laws were adopted in regular and special sessions that year -- from legislation that toughened requirements for hazardous-waste permits to a bill that created a $ 25 million fund for oil-spill cleanup and prevention .
Now , three years later , it 's time to ask : How have they turned out ?
The question is n't academic .
Lawmakers , industry groups and environmentalists are assessing the 1991 initiatives with an eye toward improving -- or rolling back -- some of the efforts .
`` There was a great flurry of legislation that passed in 1991 with great fanfare but with very little scrutiny , '' says Buck Wynne , chairman of the Texas Water Commission at the time and now a Dallas lawyer .
`` We 're just now beginning to see the impact of the legislation -- some of it good , some of it bad .
'' Tough new rules have made it harder for hazardous-waste facilities to win permits .
The centerpiece of Gov. Ann Richards 's environmental agenda was the Hazardous Waste Policy Act , adopted without opposition in the last days of the 1991 session .
The law sets some of the toughest standards in the U.S. for companies wishing to store , dispose of or burn hazardous waste .
Among other things , it requires applicants seeking a permit to notify neighboring residents and landowners , and prohibits new commercial waste sites within a half-mile of a church , school , day-care center or residential area .
The result ?
`` For the first time in history , we have probably denied as many hazardous-waste management permits as we have approved , '' says John Hall , chairman of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission , which has issued six commercial hazardous-waste permits , turned down three applications and had five withdrawn since the law took effect .
Environmentalists are so pleased that they would like to see the rules expanded to municipal landfills .
But the hazardous-waste industry , while not planning a legislative attack , has assailed the law as unnecessarily restrictive .
The rules `` seem to be capricious , '' says a spokesman for Lafarge Corp. of Reston , Va. , which was denied a permit to burn hazardous waste in New Braunfels .
`` There is no hard data to show there is any threat posed to a residence by that arbitrary distance .
'' Recycling by cities and government agencies has fallen short of legislators ' ambitious goals .
Senate Bill 1340 required state agencies to recycle and to buy more recycled goods , prodded the state 's newspapers to use more recycled newsprint , and established programs to eliminate the improper disposal of used tires and motor oil .
Cities were urged to reduce solid waste going into landfills by 40 % .
The goals were ambitious .
Perhaps too ambitious .
`` Industry is doing a fairly good job , '' says Sen. Carl Parker , the bill 's sponsor , `` but cities are a problem .
'' Although newspaper publishers have exceeded their voluntary targets -LRB- they now meet 37 % of their newsprint needs with recycled material -RRB- , cities and counties still recycle only 12 % of solid waste -- the same percentage as in 1991 .
The TNRCC is now considering recommending a mandatory ban on yard waste in landfills .
Meanwhile , a tire-recycling program may have succeeded too well .
Under the program , which pays processors 85 cents for each passenger tire they shred , about 59 million tires have been removed from mosquito-plagued , fire-prone tire dumps .
Yet the $ 2 fee collected on the sale of new tires has n't produced enough revenue for the state to pay for all the tires being shredded .
State officials had expected only a half-dozen companies would enter the shredding business ; instead , about 20 did so .
Some critics contend that the program attracts tires from out of state .
`` We had more processors coming in than we expected , more tires coming in than expected , but we were n't getting more money than we expected , '' says Jennifer Sidnell , manager of automotive-waste recycling programs at the TNRCC .
`` We had a legitimate concern that the fund might go bankrupt .
'' In response , the state has capped its total payments , and is auditing all shredding companies to see if they have been paid for tires they did n't actually shred .
Shredders , angry at the change , want the Legislature to remove the payout limits .
Some also want to delay a provision in the law that will , in 1996 , stop paying shredders who do n't in turn sell the tires to buyers who burn them for fuel .
But legislators , concerned that piles of used tires are being replaced by piles of tire chips , are n't likely to approve a delay .
Texas has taken a leading role in complying with the federal Clean Air Act , proposing easier rules in some areas , tougher rules in others .
The Legislature in 1991 gave the TNRCC authority to draft the state 's plan for implementing the Clean Air Act , allowing it to deviate from federal guidelines .
All sides have found something to criticize in the proposals , which require federal approval .
Environmentalists , for instance , have complained about a TNRCC proposal to accept pollution-control plans for petrochemical plants and refineries that are less costly -- and , critics say , perhaps less effective -- than those the Environmental Protection Agency normally allows .
And business has found fault with proposed alternative-fuel requirements for commercial fleets that are more stringent than comparable federal rules .
The TNRCC is expected to vote on the alternative-fuels rules today .
If it approves them , business lobbyists hope to persuade legislators to change them and , in particular , to include reformulated gasoline in its list of approved alternative fuels .
Efforts to coordinate protection of coastal areas bring complaints of regulatory overreaching , while an initiative to share pollution monitoring of large rivers and lakes encounters reluctant regulators .
Land Commissioner Garry Mauro 's recent request for more time in adopting a comprehensive coastal-management plan reflects the unexpected complexity -- and controversy -- surrounding the attempt to coordinate a jumble of often conflicting regulations affecting the state 's 370 miles of Gulf coastline .
Opponents contend that the plan -- the result of 1991 legislation creating the Coastal Coordination Council -- imposes an extra level of regulation over everything from beachfront housing construction to inland agriculture .
But they concede it 's less intrusive than what could have emerged from the broad legislation .
`` We remain to be convinced that we need a coastal-management plan , '' says Jon Fisher , senior vice president for research at the Texas Chemical Council .
`` But we are a lot more comfortable with the plan '' as it now exists .
Mr. Fisher plans to lobby the Legislature to codify into law part of the plan as drafted .
Another 1991 law requires the state 's 10 largest river authorities to perform semiannual assessments of water quality in their watersheds , taking up some pollution-monitoring tasks previously held by the old water commission .
But the law has encountered resistance from many of the authorities , which are mainly utilities traditionally more concerned about water quantity than water quality .
`` You ca n't be a regulator and an operator at the same time , '' says Sam Scott , executive-services manager with the Trinity River Authority based in Dallas .
The Trinity River agency , primarily responsible for providing water and wastewater services to cities along the river , has used state funding for the program mainly to help communities in the watershed pay for trash pickup .
On the other end of the spectrum is the Lower Colorado River Authority .
The Austin-based authority has n't been shy about recommending clean-up actions within its watershed , which extends from Matagorda Bay to the New Mexico border .
One target has been excess salinity in the river , caused in part by improper disposal of oil-well drilling fluids and by abandoned oil wells .
As part of its latest water-quality assessment , the authority recommended more funding for a state well-plugging program .
-- Required the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to assess the need for new hazardous-waste facilities and adopt a permitting process that emphasizes waste reduction and encourages innovative disposal techniques and recycling .
-- Required applicants wanting to build a new hazardous-waste facility to give notice to all residents , businesses and property owners within a half-mile of the proposed facility .
-- Gave the commission broad authority to deny , suspend or revoke hazardous-waste permits of companies with records of environmental violations .
-- Required applicants to prove that they have the financial resources to build , operate or close the proposed facility .
-- Prohibited new hazardous-waste facilities within a half-mile of residences , churches , schools , public parks , day-care facilities and public drinking supplies .
-- Consolidated most state environmental regulation under a single agency , the TNRCC .
-- Set time limits for the TNRCC to act on permit applications .
-- Authorized the TNRCC to develop plans and policies to bring the state into compliance with the federal Clean Air Act .
Senate Bill 1053 : Created the Coastal Coordination Council , with authority for developing a management plan to protect Texas coastal areas .
House Bill 1214 : Expanded eligibility requirements and reduced the deductible for payments from the state petroleum storage tank cleanup fund .
Senate Bill 1340 : Created new recycling programs and set a goal of recycling 40 % of municipal solid waste by Jan. 1 , 1994 .
Encouraged government entities to buy recycled products and established a used-oil recycling program .
Also established a tire-recycling program funded through a fee added to the purchase of new tires .
Senate Bill 14 : Created a $ 25 million fund , financed by a charge of two cents a barrel on all petroleum products , for cleaning and preventing coastal oil spills .
NEW YORK -- Investing in takeover-related stocks can be a perilous pursuit , particularly in times like these , when it seems like just about the only game in town .
Just ask some of the investors in Williams Cos. , which recently agreed to sell its WilTel Network Services long-distance unit to LDDS Communications .
Before the plan , the stock of William Cos. had a good run , hitting around $ 33 at the end of July , up from around $ 29 in a matter of days .
But what happened this week when LDDS finally came through with the high-priced `` blowout bid '' that traders were hoping for , and agreed to pay $ 2.5 billion , or 14 times estimated 1994 cash flow for WilTel ?
Normally investors might snap up the shares of a parent company that received such a rich offer for one of its businesses .
But in the case of Williams Cos. , some investors began bailing out .
Yesterday , Williams Cos. stock fell $ 1 to $ 30.25 .
Volume was 1.9 million shares , about four times the normal daily turnover .
What 's going on here ?
Is n't a blowout bid for a sold-off business enough to thrill investors in the parent company anymore ?
Maybe not , if Williams Cos. is any indication .
And do n't expect Williams Cos. ' stock to come roaring back any time soon .
Some analysts say the company 's natural gas-pipeline business is n't exactly tearing up the tracks .
In the wake of the divestiture , Williams Cos. ' earnings-growth rate is likely to fall to between 9 % and 10 % annually , from between 12 % and 13 % , analysts say .
In a conference call with investors after the announcement Monday , there were plenty of questions to go around .
Some investors were disappointed with Williams Cos. ' plans for the proceeds from the sale , which will total $ 1.6 billion after 36 % of the proceeds are paid in taxes .
Williams Cos. has said that its board authorized as much as $ 800 million to repurchase shares , while the rest may go toward acquisitions or capital spending .
`` The market 's preference would have been to get a dividend increase , '' says Joel Dobberpuhl , portfolio manager of AIM Value fund .
The company 's current dividend yield is 2.77 % .
Others say investors were expecting the net proceeds to the company to be higher than $ 1.6 billion .
`` We had cautioned that WilTel had a low ` tax basis ' but it appears that it was virtually zero , '' says Richard Gross , an analyst at Lehman Brothers .
`` Given the persistence of questions during the company 's follow-up conference call , we think that even those who had expected some tax leakage were disappointed by the amount , '' he says .
Even more than such technical explanations , the slide in Williams Cos. stock price is a sign of the rampant speculation surrounding stocks caught up in takeover activities .
Indeed , in the weeks before the bid actually surfaced , speculation had grown so frenzied that investors say they were expecting not only a `` blowout bid , '' but a little something extra on top of a big price tag -- a `` positive surprise '' as it 's called on the Street .
`` I would have liked a final number a little higher than $ 2.5 billion , '' not to mention perhaps `` a chunk of LDDS stock , '' says Mr. Dobberpuhl .
Unlike many speculators , who are already fleeing the stock , however , Mr. Dobberpuhl says he will continue to hold his Williams Cos. shares .
He wo n't say what he paid , but he has held the stock for a while .
`` The transaction itself does not create a jump in earnings , '' says Lehman 's Mr. Gross .
That 's not exactly what speculators want to hear , he allows .
How quickly the company will be able to increase earnings will depend on how much and how quickly the company buys back stock and makes acquisitions .
In the short run , Mr. Gross thinks the stock could head back down toward 27 or 28 , though he likes the stock for the long run .
Bulls predict Williams Cos. ' management will use the $ 1.6 billion wisely .
Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group yesterday said it 's considering upgrading Williams ' debt , including the triple-B-minus senior unsecured debt , `` if the company 's financial profile improves .
'' A spokesman for Williams Cos. cautioned that the investors may be `` reading too much '' into the authorization of the share repurchase .
`` The board authorized up to $ 800 million , but it could be zero , '' he said .
Further , he said , the company expects to replace WilTel 's growth eventually , but not necessarily immediately .
`` I do n't believe we will be able to replace WilTel 's growth in a matter of one year , '' he said .
Still , the Oklahoma company is upbeat .
`` You 're never going to satisfy all the investors because they all have different objectives , '' the spokesman said .
And nowadays with some investors expecting `` better-than-blowout '' bids , that is more true than ever .
Politicians have decided they can never defeat term limits , except by damming them off from voters .
So House Speaker Tom Foley and others are challenging their constitutionality in court .
And this month Illinois pols succeeded in denying the right even to bring a term limit measure to the vote of the people .
The Illinois Supreme Court voted 4 to 3 to remove a term limit measure that had been placed on the November ballot by more than 400,000 citizens and was leading 68 % to 22 % in polls .
However , the court did n't explain its reasoning , noting in an unusual move that its actual opinion would `` follow '' later .
Legal scholars expect the court to agree with the Chicago Bar Association , which sued to remove the initiative .
It argued that the Illinois Constitution permits only voter initiatives that deal with `` structure and procedural '' aspects of the state Legislature .
The Bar Association claimed that curbing the tenure of state legislators goes beyond those limits .
That kind of reasoning upset the three dissenting justices .
Judge Moses Harrison II wrote that while the Illinois Constitution bars voter initiatives , it allows an exception for proposals affecting the Legislature as a check on its self-interest .
`` To hold that the law mandates a contrary result is a fiction that venerates the power of our incumbent legislators and demeans the intelligence of our constituents , '' he wrote .
`` Without an initiative , there is no realistic possibility that a term limit amendment can ever be realized .
'' Indeed , the court 's decision reeks of politics .
Steve Neal , political columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times , notes that `` the high court has a long tradition of aligning itself with the political establishment .
'' Term limits is the fourth initiative affecting the Legislature it has removed from the ballot .
In 1990 , the court threw a black third party off Cook County 's ballot .
The Democratic machine viewed it as a threat , and the U.S. Supreme Court had to intervene to restore its ballot status .
The Illinois court also rejected a 1986 initiative to make Chicago 's mayor a nonpartisan official , an idea that horrified the machine .
`` Sometimes the good justices ought to give voters an even break , '' says Mr. Neal .
That is n't likely .
None of the four justices who voted against term limits face a voter retention election anytime soon .
Three of the four are products of the Cook County Democratic Party , including former Chicago machine mayor Michael Bilandic and Mary Ann McMorrow , a cousin of Rep. Dan Rostenkowski .
Pat Quinn is the reform Democrat leading the battle for term limits in Illinois .
He beat the machine to be elected state Treasurer in 1990 , and is now running for Secretary of State `` to clean up our election laws .
'' He believes state government is controlled by a small political elite that works in sync to thwart the popular will on issues ranging from a legislative super-majority for tax increases to school reform .
He says it is `` unseemly '' for the Chicago Bar Association to use its required dues money to serve as `` initiative police .
'' He 's certainly right about that .
`` Their two big issues have been a law to prevent anyone from running for judge unless they 've been a lawyer for 10 years , and a pay raise for all judges and other officials .
'' Incidentally , a 12 % pay raise for state judges passed the Legislature only days before the court 's ruling on term limits .
Mr. Quinn has n't given up .
He will appeal the court 's ruling , but is also contemplating another initiative .
Since 1970 , the only voter initiative allowed on the ballot has been one that reduced the size of the Legislature .
`` We just might try that again , '' says Mr. Quinn .
`` At least that would mean term limits for some of them .
'' Two New Jersey trash-hauling brothers who won a landmark Supreme Court case against municipal control of trash were indicted on charges of running a racketeering enterprise and defrauding a Bergen County , N.J. , agency of nearly $ 22.5 million .
In a 31-count indictment yesterday , a state grand jury in New Jersey charged brothers Carmine and Salvatore Franco of Bergen County , four of their adult children , two of their businesses and two employees with conspiracy to commit racketeering .
The defendants also were charged with theft , operating an unauthorized solid-waste business , falsifying and tampering with records , and filing fraudulent tax returns , among other things .
The Francos recently won a battle against municipal sanitation chiefs when the Supreme Court ruled that local governments could n't prohibit trash haulers from shipping garbage to other states for cheaper disposal .
Last week , however , the House Energy and Commerce Committee approved a bill that would restore some municipal authority .
Yesterday , New Jersey Attorney General Deborah T. Poritz said the indictment claims the Franco brothers continued to control and operate their solid-waste businesses with the help of family members after being barred by law in the mid-1980s from any participation in the solid-waste industry .
The brothers are alleged to have ties to organized crimes , but they have denied such allegations .
The indictment also claims that one of the Franco businesses , Sal Car Transfer Systems Inc. , failed to transfer solid waste picked up in Bergen County to the Bergen County Utilities Authority and instead shipped the waste unlawfully to landfills in other states .
This practice , the indictment says , defrauded the county authority of about $ 22.5 million .
If convicted on all counts , the brothers face a substantial prison sentence and a maximum fine of $ 760,000 each .
The two family businesses , Sal Car Transfer Systems and Northeastern Recycling Co. could be fined as much as $ 2.3 million and $ 660,000 respectively .
Salvatore Franco said he was unaware of the details of the indictment and would n't comment until he conferred with his attorneys .

Rollins Environmental Services Inc. said it intends to acquire Westinghouse Electric Corp. 's Aptus Inc. for $ 160 million in cash , debt and securities .
Aptus , an environmental-services unit , has incineration operations in Kansas and Utah and a related operation in Minnesota .
A Rollins spokesman said Rollins 's core business is incineration of hazardous wastes .
The planned acquisition will bring Rollins `` state-of-the-art technology '' and help it expand its services , he said .
Rollins , based in Wilmington , Del. , reported revenue of $ 214 million for 1993 .
Aptus , which employs 600 people , had revenue of $ 85 million in its latest fiscal year .
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday , Rollins closed up 12.5 cents at $ 6 a share , and Westinghouse closed up 62.5 cents at $ 12.75 .
Under the agreement , which is subject to certain conditions and approvals , Rollins will pay $ 3 million in cash ; the remainder of the payment will be proceeds from the reissuance of industrial development bonds , and securities .
`` We are always looking for opportunities to enhance shareholder value , and this sale provides us with an exceptional opportunity , '' said Michael H. Jordan , chairman of Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse .
He said Westinghouse will use the proceeds to reduce debt .
In addition , he said , the Rollins debt and convertible securities that Westinghouse will receive will provide the company with `` a vehicle to participate in the recovery of the environmental-services business as it rebounds .
'' Westinghouse said the sale is expected to be completed `` promptly '' following governmental review and approval by directors of both companies .

'' Can Bruce Gibson rescue the Texas Chamber of Commerce ?
The business executives who sit on the chamber 's board certainly hope so .
Last month , they lured Mr. Gibson away from his $ 90,000-a-year job as executive assistant to Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock to become president of the lobbying organization .
Chamber members are counting on Mr. Gibson , who spent six terms in the Texas House and two years as Mr. Bullock 's top staffer , to increase the group 's legislative clout , especially in coming battles over workers compensation and tax policy .
More important , they hope he can reverse a recent drop in fund raising and breathe new life into an organization they say should be the state 's leading business group .
`` People will believe in the state chamber because they believe in the local chambers , '' Mr. Gibson says .
`` What the chamber needs is to better identify its role in the public-policy arena .
'' Mr. Gibson , a 40-year-old who also has a dairy farm , has his work cut out for him .
The chamber 's revenue has plunged nearly 30 % this year , largely because the organization switched from its traditional membership blitz , in which a big Texas company leaned on other businesses to join , to an internal fund-raising staff .
And though many of the items on its legislative agenda passed this year -- notably a tort-reform measure and a move toward trucking deregulation -- the chamber mainly played a support role for other business groups and pressed no significant initiatives of its own .
`` It 's had a hard time finding its niche , '' says George Christian , an Austin political consultant and a founder of the Texas Association of Taxpayers , another statewide business group .
The Texas Chamber has some clear strengths .
Formed in 1988 out of several regional chambers , it has in its membership 2,700 businesses and 300 local chambers , giving it an unmatched grass-roots network in large and small cities .
It draws leadership from among the state 's top executives -- next year 's chairman , Robert Lane , is president of NationsBank of Texas -- and its broad-based membership reflects the diversity of Texas business .
From its inception , many members envisioned the state chamber as a single strong voice for business that could rise above the din of separate business lobbies in Austin .
Scores of single-industry groups , from the Texas Automobile Dealers Association to the Texas Tank Truckers Association , try to make their voices heard in the capital .
In addition , a handful of single-issue groups -- the Texas Civil Justice League , for one -- represent a range of companies , as do the chamber and the Texas Association of Business .
`` In a competitive world , all of us realize there has got to be a way to increase our effectiveness and reduce our costs , '' says Don Carlton , chairman and chief executive of Radian Corp. , an environmental-consulting firm based in Austin .
Businesspeople may agree on that goal , but their frequent disagreements on specific issues have made it hard to achieve .
Take tax policy .
The Texas Association of Taxpayers represents mainly big corporations hit hardest by the state 's reliance on property and franchise taxes .
The group has favored a personal income tax .
But the idea is unpopular among most small and some large companies , and the chamber ca n't reach a consensus on the issue .
Mr. Gibson indicates that he will try to minimize this problem by `` finding the issues that definitely belong to the chamber .
'' He sees the group taking a lead role on central work-force issues , such as education , and on other subjects that affect business broadly , including health care .
`` The role of the chamber is going to have to develop over time , '' he says .
Before he does anything else , Mr. Gibson must put the group on a solid financial footing .
Revenue , derived mainly from membership dues , plunged last year , forcing the organization to slash its 1993 budget to $ 800,000 from $ 1.1 million last year and to lay off seven of 12 staffers .
Chamber officials expect next year 's revenues to return to 1992 levels .
Mr. Gibson 's main job , though , will be to heighten the chamber 's influence in Austin .
The group has gradually increased its presence in the Legislature , but has rarely assumed a leading role in pushing legislation .
The chamber did n't make the list of the 10 most effective Texas lobbying organizations in a poll by the Quorum Report , an Austin newsletter .
The Texas Association of Business , the chamber 's rival group , ranked seventh .
`` We 've really been a little light in people who have Bruce 's experience , '' says Alan Shivers Jr. , the chamber 's current chairman .
`` I think now you 'll see us taking more of a proactive role .
'' As a legislator , Mr. Gibson was a skilled back-room negotiator .
He was a co-author of the 1989 workers compensation revisions and helped revive the final bill after it appeared dead .
In Mr. Bullock 's office , he crafted the constitutional amendment approved last month barring a state income tax without voter approval .
Mr. Gibson plans to bolster the chamber 's public-policy and research staff .
The goal : to give the group ammunition to take the lead on such important issues as workers compensation .
He also plans to draw more extensively on the 200,000 members of local chambers around the state to give the group more clout in Austin .
And he plans to prepare the chamber to weigh in when the Legislature addresses the state 's role in President Clinton 's proposed health-care overhaul .
`` There 's not another organization that 's better positioned to work on the implementation of the Clinton health-care plan , '' Mr. Gibson says .
The Texas Economic Index , a weekly leading indicator , rose to 113.7 in the latest week from 113.6 in the previous week .
Contributing factors included a drop in initial unemployment claims and a rise in Texas refinery output .
All other components were flat in the latest period .
On a year-over-year basis , the annual growth rate of the index fell to 3.81 % in the latest week from 3.87 % in the prior week .
Insiders at some technology companies apparently believe strong sales abroad will mean strong performances by their respective stocks .
Technology companies where insiders are showing a growing appetite for stock include industry giant International Business Machines Corp. and Scientific-Atlanta Inc. , according to recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
IBM Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. , for instance , snapped up 10,000 shares in the company at the end of July , lifting his stake by 25 % to 50,000 shares in a purchase valued at $ 623,750 .
Mr. Gerstner , who has made 13 separate open-market purchases since he joined IBM in April 1993 , picked up the shares for an average $ 62.375 .
This and another 10,000-share purchase on Aug. 2 last year were his largest buys to date .
Last year , IBM derived 60 % of its revenue overseas , much of it in Europe .
A company spokesman said Mr. Gerstner would n't comment about the purchases .
The stock closed yesterday at $ 67.625 , down 12.5 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Wall Street analysts say that exposure to the large and recovering European market bodes well for U.S. technology companies .
`` Earnings are going to be much better than the Street expects , both for the remainder of this year and into 1995 , '' predicts Melissa Brown , director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities in New York .
`` Economies overseas , especially in Europe , are probably going to accelerate , and strength in overseas sales should filter down to bottom-line growth even if the U.S. economy does slow down from current levels .
'' At Scientific-Atlanta , a provider of land-based and satellite-based communications networks , `` international sales are going to be a very important and growing part of our business , '' says Robert Meyers , a company spokesman .
International sales accounted for almost 33 % of the company 's total revenue in the fiscal year ended July 1 , compared with less than 26 % a year earlier , he points out .
Whether such factors figure into insiders ' calculations ca n't be certain , but they probably play a part , Mr. Meyers says .
`` The reason insiders buy stock is usually based on an overall perception of a company .
We feel the outlook is bright both domestically and internationally .
'' Two insiders at the company , whose core business is cable-television electronics , picked up a combined 2,500 shares in recent months , SEC filings show .
A number of small technology companies with substantial overseas exposure -- at least 20 % of revenue -- have also had insiders moving into the buy mode .
Among them : Emulex Corp. , Telebit Corp. , Microcom Inc. and Intergraph Corp. .
Analysts who track insider activity say they expect to see more buying activity at both large-cap and small-cap technology companies well into 1995 .
Bob Gabele , president of CDA\/Investnet in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , notes : `` It looks as though there 's been a subtle shift in insider momentum .
Selling in the tech-hardware group had been high for the past two years but has dried up significantly in the current environment .
Any transition to heavy insider buying in these issues is probably going to be gradual .
'' Mike Painchaud , director of research at Market Profile Theorems in Seattle , says that the technology sector has moved from one of the most bearish insider profiles to a moderately bullish profile during the past three months .
`` My guess is that insiders at the large-cap technology exporters are looking forward to better fortunes , driven by improvement in overseas demand for their products , '' he says .
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago named Michael Moskow , an economist and business executive who served as deputy U.S. trade representative in the Bush administration , as its new president .
The decision runs against the Fed 's recent practice of filling such posts from inside the Fed system .
Mr. Moskow , 56 years old , is a professor at Northwestern University 's Kellogg School of Management .
He will succeed Silas Keehn Sept. 1 .
Mr. Keehn is retiring after 13 years in the job .
The new president earned his doctorate in economics at the University of Pennsylvania , and held positions in the Nixon and Ford administrations -- including serving a stint as director of the Council on Wage and Price Stability .
In the late 1970s and 1980s , he worked in strategic planning positions at several Chicago companies , including Esmark Inc. , Northwest Industries Inc. , Dart & Kraft Inc. and Premark International .
But Mr. Moskow has never worked for the Fed .
The choice of an outsider was unusual .
In the past few years , the regional banks in Boston , Dallas , Kansas City , Mo. , Richmond , Va. , and New York have all picked Fed insiders as their presidents .
The regional bank presidents are chosen by the banks ' private-sector directors , subject to approval of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington .
The Chicago Fed search committee met with 10 candidates for the job , and the three finalists were interviewed by the Fed governors in Washington .
At any given time , five of the 12 Fed presidents vote on monetary policy ; Mr. Moskow 's turn will come in 1995 .
HOUSTON -- The Houston Bagel Lady believes in her product , but trust , not crust , is the key to her business .
Since last September , Kim Kaleel has been dropping off fresh bagels -LRB- with cream cheese -RRB- each Wednesday morning to companies in this city 's Galleria area .
Using the honor system , Mrs. Kaleel asks employees to leave $ 1 for each bagel , and then returns several hours later to fetch her cash .
`` A lot of people said , ` You 're crazy , they are n't going to pay you , ' '' Mrs. Kaleel says .
In fact , about 15 % of her customers do n't pay her , and she had to stop serving one commercial real-estate firm because the place was packed with deadbeats .
But overall , she makes decent dough .
Mrs. Kaleel delivers 500 bagels once a week to about 30 companies , including Merrill Lynch and Trammell Crow .
The 41-year-old Mrs. Kaleel says she earns up to $ 300 per outing .
But it 's hard work .
Mrs. Kaleel picks up her preordered treats from the bakery at 5 a.m. Wearing sunglasses to hide her sleep-deprived red eyes , she spends three hours dashing in and out of office buildings , and then retraces her steps to retrieve her money .
To facilitate parking , she bribes security officers with free bagels .
Disappointments occur .
A trucking company she called upon had never even heard of bagels .
A large insurance company effectively fired her when it began providing its own bagels to raise money for an employee club .
`` It broke my heart , '' Mrs. Kaleel says .
But her bagels are on the rise .
In October , Mrs. Kaleel will begin providing bagels to downtown businesses each Tuesday .
`` The sky 's the limit , '' she says .
Hong Kong witnessed one of its most subdued property auctions in a decade , as the government failed to sell one of three lots of land it put on the block and the other two sold at their opening bids .
The tepid auction of the residential , warehouse and industrial sites was viewed as reflecting a summer lull in an already quiet property market , rather than a sharp downturn .
Yet it did show that measures to cool the market have started to take hold .
Hong Kong property prices had tripled in the two years through last April .
Under pressure to bring apartment prices back within reach of the middle class , the government in early June prohibited buyers of unfinished apartments from selling them prior to completion .
It also barred developers from selling homes more than nine months before construction is done .
The moves damped activity among speculators .
Though prices for low to midpriced apartments have fallen about 10 % , luxury-home values kept relatively firm .
Demand for industrial property is weak , as many manufacturers have moved to China .
An ad was discontinued in Singapore after Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said it promoted U.S.-style insolence to parents -- though it was created in Malaysia by Asians .
In the print ad for a children 's nutritional supplement , a boy wearing a baseball cap sideways says with his fist raised : `` Come on , Dad .
If you can play golf five times a week , I can have Sustagen once a day .
'' Mr. Goh faulted attitudes and manners that undermine Asian children 's traditional politeness and deference to parents and elders .
The government has campaigned against `` Western values '' it asserts emphasize individual rights at the expense of family and society .
More than half of all Japanese employers are n't considering drastic workforce alterations , despite the drop in the U.S. dollar 's value against the Japanese yen , a Labor Ministry survey found .
Only 4 % of companies are weighing new labor policies in efforts to deal with the yen 's appreciation in relation to major currencies .
But a third may have to cut or shift staffing if the yen sustains its rise .
For exporters dependent on overseas earnings , a strong yen makes their goods more expensive in foreign markets .
Ukraine will give up its overvalued exchange rate and let the market set the value of the karbovanet currency .
Under a presidential decree , Kiev 's interbank currency exchange will reopen Oct. 1 after a closure of almost 11 months .
The central bank , meanwhile , will try to boost gradually the official rate of 20,500 karbovanets to the U.S. dollar ; the black-market rate is 47,000 .
And exporters now must sell 30 % rather than 50 % of earnings to the state at the official rate .
President Leonid Kuchma said his decree initiates long-awaited steps to speed economic reform , such as boosting exports , reducing imports and shoring up Ukraine 's hard-currency reserves .
Canada logged the biggest drop in its crime rate in more than three decades , the government 's Center for Justice Statistics said .
Criminal offenses reported last year totaled just over three million , and about half of these were property-related , such as auto theft .
Of the total , 10 % were violent crimes , a category that shrank for the first time since the mid-1970s .
The number of homicides last year fell 14 % to 630 .
Because of Japan 's drought , 5.5 million people , or 4.5 % of the population , receive tap water only part of each day .
That total tops the record of 4.6 million people subject to water rationing in a 1978 drought , the government said .
Restrictions are in force in 123 cities , towns and villages in 23 of Japan 's 47 prefectures , or regions .
And though an additional 4.4 million people have unrestricted access to tap water , it is being delivered with lower pressure ; thus , the water shortage affects 9.9 million people overall in 31 prefectures .
The drought also has caused $ 102 million in damage to the agricultural and livestock industries .
Foreign investors in Venezuela may repatriate profits without restrictions under new rules that are likely to be approved this week by the government 's Exchange Administration Board .
`` There are no new limitations , '' a board official said .
`` The system is essentially the same as it was before .
'' Investment from abroad , especially in company shares , has been virtually frozen since June 27 , when controls were imposed partly to halt capital flight .
The state is liquidating financial institutions that it took over in June following a run on their deposits in the wake of a January bank collapse that sparked the crisis .
Some airlines , citing problems in sending earnings out of Venezuela , had threatened to halt service there .
Six Chilean industrial groups formed a 40-member team to augment government efforts to land a free-trade deal with the U.S. ... Belgian customs officials seized 140 pounds of ivory at Zaventem Airport in Brussels , where the smuggled goods were en route from Zaire to China and where a 220-pound cache of contraband ivory was intercepted only last week .
A 1989 global protocol banned ivory trading , to help Africa 's dwindling elephant population .
Texas retailers can expect a merry Christmas this year , but not quite a rapturous one .
That , at least , is the consensus forecast of nine economists who monitor the state 's vital signs .
In a survey , the nine predict Yuletide sales will rise between 4.9 % and 8.4 % this year in Texas , with a mean estimate of 6.5 % .
That 's a shade higher than what 's expected for the U.S. as a whole , but slightly off the 8.3 % pace in Texas for December of 1992 .
Still , considering last year 's strong increase , a 6.5 % jump would be pretty healthy , and a sign that consumer confidence is on the rebound again .
As always , the outlook is better in some parts of Texas than others .
In the Austin-San Antonio corridor , where employment is up sharply , most experts are looking for retail sales to leap as much as 10 % this Christmas .
Houston , still stuck in the oil-patch slump , will likely be closer to half that , while Dallas-Fort Worth is expected to split the difference .
And the border region is still suffering from Mexican limits on the value of goods that can be brought back from the U.S. M. Ray Perryman , president , Perryman Consultants Inc. , Waco : `` Consumer confidence is coming back a little bit , '' says Mr. Perryman , who predicts growth of `` somewhere around 7 % '' this December .
He credits steady job-growth figures in most parts of the state , as well as the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement , for the renewed optimism .
`` I think Nafta has given a feel-good feeling , and job-growth figures have given a feel-good feeling , '' he says .
Magnus Kpakol , senior economist , J.C. Penney Co. , Plano : `` We expect Texas to be strong , '' says Mr. Kpakol , estimating that sales of general merchandise and apparel in the state will be up 6 % to 6.5 % in the fourth quarter , compared with the same period last year .
J.C. Penney expects industry sales in those categories to rise 6 % in the U.S. overall .
The Texas numbers could be even stronger , he says , if Mexican officials rescind the $ 50 limit on the value of merchandise that can be brought into the border area , duty-free .
`` Our stores were devastated '' last year when the measure was imposed , he says .
`` With decreases in interest rates , more and more consumers have gotten their personal finances in better shape and may decide to spend some more this holiday season , '' says Mr. Phillips , who expects about a 7 % jump in fourth-quarter retail sales here .
He says the Dallas-Fort Worth area should be `` fairly strong , '' with gains of about 7 % , while the holidays in Houston should be `` pretty sluggish , '' due to weakness in the oil sector .
James F. Smith , finance professor , Kenan-Flagler Business School , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill : `` There 's no way in the world this Christmas selling season will miss being the greatest in the history of Texas , and the entire United States , for that matter , '' says Mr. Smith , who expects 8 % growth this year .
`` It should be terrific , because people are working and they 're earning money , '' he says .
`` We have this truly bizarre situation in which people are saying they 're not at all confident , but now 's a great time to buy stuff .
'' Jon Hockenyos , managing director , Texas Perspectives Inc. , Austin : `` In general , I think things are going to be pretty good , '' says Mr. Hockenyos , who predicts 8.4 % growth in the fourth quarter in Texas in four retail categories : general merchandise , apparel , furniture and home furnishings and miscellaneous .
That compares with a 10 % growth rate in those categories in last year 's fourth quarter .
`` There is some sluggishness now in early Christmas season hiring , '' Mr. Hockenyos says , `` but that 's a trend we 've observed over the last couple years .
It is n't a very good indicator at this point .
'' Victor Grado , associate economist , DRI\/McGraw-Hill , Lexington , Mass. : `` Moderate '' growth is in store for Texas , on the order of 4.9 % during the fourth quarter , Mr. Grado says .
`` I think people are still worried about jobs .
'' The Dallas-Fort Worth area will be a bit lower than the state average , he says , because `` they 're still suffering a bit of a hangover from defense cuts recently .
'' `` I do n't expect to see a boom because incomes are n't growing as much as in the past , '' says Mr. Hazleton , who expects Christmas sales to grow 6 % in Texas .
Still , he adds , `` it 's better than we might have expected six months ago .
'' Imo Industries Inc. said it signed a credit facility of $ 150 million with a group of lenders led by Citicorp 's Citibank unit .
The maker of mechanical and electronic controls and power products said the new credit arrangement , replacing an existing credit facility , is intended to ensure adequate funding to meet working capital needs over the next several years .
The Aug. 5 `` World Economy '' column -LRB- `` No Key Resolution of Trade Dispute Is Likely in U.S.-Japan Confrontation '' -RRB- reports that at issue is `` the Japanese government 's reluctance to consider foreign goods when it equips programs under its direct control ; medical and telecommunications equipment are leading categories .
'' This reluctance to purchase foreign products is contradicted by the statistics -- not our own but those of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
According to 1990 GATT data , the overall foreign-product share of Japanese government procurement was 13.8 % , compared to 11.9 % in the U.S. Further , the GATT figures tell us that foreign-product share for Japanese government procurement of medical equipment was 39 % and only 1.5 % in the U.S. .
In the area of telecommunications , the share of foreign products is also higher than in the U.S. Japan , like the U.S. , complies with the GATT agreement covering government procurement .
But Japan goes even further .
Our `` Procedures for Government Procurement of Products , '' established this past March , ensures transparency in Japanese government procurement as well as more numerous and broader opportunities for foreign companies than those stipulated in the GATT accord .
New transparent and competitive measures in the fields of telecommunications and medical technology were also introduced .
In the Japan-U.S. bilateral talks , Japan has shown its willingness to take further steps to improve government procurement procedures .
Your article suggests that a government can interfere in government-funded programs in order to increase purchases of foreign products .
However , under open and competitive procedures , targeting certain fixed increases in foreign goods amounts to discrimination against domestic products -- a policy as wrong as one intended to discriminate against foreign products in favor of domestic goods .
The right way to approach this issue is through an open and competitive bidding system , where those who can produce better products at better prices , regardless of nationality , will be given a fair chance .
This is the only responsible option when taxpayers ' hard-earned money is at issue .
This is the system Japan has been pursuing and will continue to support .
PEARL RIVER , N.Y. -- Orange & Rockland Utilities Inc. said misconduct by its former chairman and chief executive , James F. Smith , resulted in at least $ 885,000 in improper business costs .
The findings are the result of a yearlong investigation , conducted by a special committee of Orange & Rockland 's board .
The utility , with customers in New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania , said it also identified another $ 3 million `` so badly documented ... that investigators could not say what portion was for proper business purposes .
'' Mr. Smith was fired last fall after several employees or former employees were charged with or admitted making illegal political campaign contributions or other charges .
The company has spent more than $ 9 million investigating the various allegations and problems .
Rockland County District Attorney Kenneth Gribetz has charged Mr. Smith with 22 felony counts , including 15 counts of grand larceny and seven counts of falsifying records .
Mr. Smith 's attorney , Jay D. Fischer , was not available to comment .
Orange & Rockland spokesman Mike Donovan said the investigators ' findings solidify formerly circumstantial charges .
That evidence , he said , includes a memo in which company officers were told they could skip documentation of business expenses if they cleared them verbally with former President Thomas A. Griffin .
In addition to revamping its internal audit procedure , Mr. Donovan said the investigation will be submitted to the various states ' public utilities commissions , as well as to the district attorney 's office .
Orange & Rockland recently named D. Louis Peoples chief executive and vice chairman .
H. Kent Vanderhoef , who was acting chairman , was appointed chairman .
Both are former directors .
AN UNUSUAL REQUEST leads to trouble for an IRS employee , now ex-employee .
`` What I 'm proposing is highly unethical but I 'm in a jam too !
'' an IRS revenue officer in Chicago wrote in a note she handed to a taxpayer owing taxes , penalties and interest .
In the note , she asked the taxpayer for a letter requesting that penalties `` be abated '' due to marital problems that prevented a timely filing because mail and documents had been withheld by the taxpayer 's spouse and her accountant .
`` The worse your story sounds the more I can abate , '' she wrote .
Then , she added : `` In exchange for this , would you be willing to advance me $ 2,500 to $ 4,000 to help me out of my situation ?
'' The woman , Laverne L. Davis , said she was merely seeking a `` loan , '' not soliciting a bribe , says her lawyer .
She also said she had decided to recommend an abatement of penalties regardless of whether she received the `` loan .
'' But a jury found her guilty of soliciting a bribe .
Sentencing is set for Dec. 8 , says Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian P. Netols .
Ms. Davis plans to appeal .
A TAX CREDIT to help the working poor is n't working well , tax specialists say .
The earned-income credit remains a mystery to many of the poor people it is supposed to help .
Some do n't realize they are eligible or ca n't figure out how to take advantage of it , says a report sponsored by the American Tax Policy Institute , a nonprofit research group in Washington .
One reason : Eligibility rules and paperwork to file claims are `` complex , '' says the report .
Many lawmakers are equally worried about fraudulent claims .
All this underscores the need to overhaul the credit , says Karen V. Kole , a visiting law professor at the University of Detroit 's London program .
She heads a national `` outreach program '' of the American Bar Association 's tax section to educate the working poor , help the IRS reduce fraud and work on legislative proposals to simplify the credit .
The credit is `` a mess '' but probably wo n't be cleaned up anytime soon , says Phillip Mann of the Miller & Chevalier law firm in Washington .
SWEET HARMONY : Several musicians score victories over the IRS in Tax Court .
Since the tax law allows assets to be depreciated , why ca n't professional violinists depreciate their valuable violin bows ?
Thus , Richard and Fiona Simon of New York claimed $ 10,815 in depreciation deductions on their 1989 return for their two 19th-century bows by the renowned Francois Tourte .
And Brian P. Liddle in Philadelphia depreciated his 17th-century Ruggieri bass viol , deducting $ 3,170 for 1987 .
The musicians argued that their tools of the trade suffered wear and tear .
Forget it , the IRS replied .
It said the instruments also are treasured artworks for which it is impossible to set a useful life , and that such instruments tend to rise in value .
But the musicians won in two separate Tax Court cases .
`` This gives musicians the same right everyone else has to use the best equipment to make their living , '' says David L. Segal , a lawyer for Mr. Liddle .
But numerous Tax Court judges , including Chief Judge Hamblen , dissented .
The IRS is `` studying '' whether to appeal .
PHANTOM MUNCHKINS ?
To discourage taxpayers from inventing infants to claim as dependents , Congress may require reporting Social Security numbers for all dependents , regardless of age .
Current law requires reporting Social Security numbers of dependents age one year or older .
THE IRS SEIZED and sold a car owned by a Wisconsin man .
The man demanded to know who bought the car , but the IRS would n't say .
U.S. District Court Judge John Shabaz rules in favor of the IRS , noting the government 's argument that people would be less likely to buy seized property if their identity were to be revealed .
FEARS GROW that long-awaited nanny-tax law changes may be delayed once again .
Until recently , it seemed a safe bet that Congress this summer would rewrite tax rules for household employees , such as housekeepers and gardeners .
The House and Senate already have approved changes .
But those two bills differ in major ways , and now , with Congress preoccupied by health care , the outlook for nanny-tax overhaul appears murky .
`` It 's quite possible we 'll see another legislative session lapse without enactment of this legislation , '' says Pam Olson , a Washington lawyer at Skadden Arps .
A Senate staffer says these fears `` are not unfounded '' but that support for a new law remains strong and that Congress probably will act this fall .
Under current law , employers must file quarterly for anyone earning more than $ 50 a quarter .
Some officials predict Congress will raise that limit to about $ 1,000 a year , with annual filing , and exempt all workers under the age of 18 .
The American Bar Association suggests a `` grace period '' in which nonfilers could pay overdue taxes without interest .

ON THE BOSPORUS -- At one point in its 19-mile run from the Black Sea through the center of Istanbul , the Bosporus divides Asia from Europe by less than half a mile .
It zigs and zags in blind turns .
It whips up whirlpools .
It casts nets of fog .
Ferryboats and fishing boats , tankers and supertankers crowd and crisscross its lanes like freeway traffic on a cow path .
But for Turkish pilots who guide ships through the Bosporus and know it better than anyone else , it is the current that makes this strait so dire .
Not the surface current , which gains speed in the narrows ; not even the bottom current , which rushes the opposite way ; but the current that gurgles out of foreign ministries -- the undercurrent of oil , money and politics .
Through 13 wars and 500 years of diplomacy , Turkey and Russia have maneuvered for control of the Bosporus and its tamer twin , the Dardanelles , the two strategic spigots between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean .
In 1936 , they came to terms .
The Montreux Convention let Turkey command its straits in wartime .
In peacetime , the treaty granted all ships freedom of passage , `` by day and by night , under any flag and with any cargo , without any formalities .
'' Stalin did n't love it , but Boris Yeltsin does .
Russia sees no reason to give up its free run of the strait .
Turkey sees a bunch of reasons : the birth of oil-oozing states in the Caucasus and Central Asia , a race for rights to move their oil , and a consequent oil-driven contest to influence these states politically .
If tankers keep sailing unimpeded through the Bosporus , Russia will win .
If oil is piped to the Mediterranean instead , Turkey will win .
That would be explanation enough for the tension surfacing on the strait this summer , but Turkey has one more : a certainty that this old-power rivalry is leading to a huge oil spill , not in pristine wilderness but downtown in a city of 11 million .
Which is why Omur Oztaskin wants the oncoming Russian freighter to stop .
The Turkish pilot looks out into a white haze from the bridge of the Seavinha , the tanker he is shepherding southward toward the Sea of Marmara .
He can see the grainy shape of a cruise ship just ahead in the southbound lane .
But the Russian , coming north toward the Black Sea , is out of sight behind the 80-degree bend of Kandili Cape .
Mr. Oztaskin has picked up its signal on his radio : Russian-accented English .
A bad sign .
It means the captain has n't taken a pilot .
`` Good afternoon , captain , '' Mr. Oztaskin calls into his handset .
`` I am pilot of southbound vessel .
We are approaching .
I advise slow down and await my turn .
'' The radio crackles .
The Russian is thinking it over .
In 1936 , the largest Turkish ship to transit the Bosporus hauled 13 dead-weight tons .
Now , 200,000-ton supertankers pass every three or four months , 130,000-tonners every three or four days .
In a year , 40,000 good-sized ships sail through .
Half fly foreign flags , and half of those are Russian .
They lug 20 billion gallons of oil and chemicals through a shoal of 600,000 small boats .
Lately , they have got into a habit of crashing into one another .
In 1981 , there were two collisions on the Bosporus .
Between 1988 and 1992 , there were 155 .
In 1991 alone , there were 57 .
`` Like our road traffic , '' says Razzan Battuk , a shipping agent on shore .
`` Big accidents once a year , small ones regularly .
'' This year 's big one happened in March .
Thirty people died .
An empty freighter rammed the Nassia , a tanker laden with 19 million gallons of oil .
Three of its 10 tanks ruptured .
The oil caught fire and burned for a week .
The Exxon Valdez , breaking up in Alaska five years ago , spilled 11 million gallons .
The Russian captain hidden behind Kandili Cape may have heard about that .
`` Pilot !
'' his voice rasps on the radio .
`` OK .
We wait .
'' But does he have to ?
By dint of the Montreux Convention , the only rule on the Bosporus is that there are n't any rules .
The Turks have marked channels and laid out lanes over the decades .
Last January , however , they decided it was high time for other countries to yield their right of way .
They presented a plan for curbing traffic to the United Nations ' International Maritime Organization .
Passage of ships over 650 feet long , it said , was `` neither desirable nor advisable .
'' If big ships must go through , said the Turks , they must get permission , sail by daylight , take tugs and hire pilots .
To avoid collisions while big ships pass , the Turks claimed the power to close the Bosporus .
In May , two months after the Nassia disaster , the IMO looked the plan over -- and junked it .
Every Black Sea state in the organization , plus Cyprus and Greece , charged Turkey with a solo assault on the 1936 treaty .
They countered with a traffic-sorting system and suggested that ships report their size and cargo , take pilots and try not to blunder in the dark .
The advice takes effect in November .
Turkey , the IMO said , must be in `` total conformity .
'' So the Turks went home , wrote a rule book that still gives them a ream of reasons to bar ships from the strait , and put it into force on July 1 .
The diplomats are n't happy .
`` The principle is liberty of passage , '' says Leonid Manjosin , Russia 's consul in Istanbul .
`` But this document '' -- the Turkish rule book -- `` says ships must give information about dangerous cargo .
There is nothing like this in the Montreux Convention .
Turkey says it can stop any vessel .
It must not be said that a vessel can be stopped .
This contradicts essential principles of maritime law .
'' The Turks say it does n't .
They say the treaty lets them direct traffic on the Bosporus .
They ca n't exactly stop ships from passing through , but that does n't exactly mean they ca n't stop ships .
`` Legally , we have all the rights , '' says Ismail Soysal , a former ambassador and leading Turkish untangler of what happened at Montreux .
`` The straits are absolutely within Turkish sovereignty .
'' What if Turkey tells a Russian ship to halt and it refuses ?
`` A warship can stop them , '' Mr. Soysal says .
`` Russia could threaten us .
Big words .
Everything will depend on Turkey 's firm stand .
'' Russia 's answer , a `` technical '' one it deems in line with the treaty , is less cataclysmic : modern radar for the strait .
Turkey 's answer , still mutinous , is more human : If big ships wo n't stay out , they might at least obey the people who know the Bosporus best .
`` If a master does n't want us , it 's at his discretion , '' Mr. Oztaskin is shouting over the din of the pilot boat 's engine .
It is just past noon .
The Seavinha 's captain has radioed his request .
Mr. Oztaskin is heading out to the Black Sea 's mouth to meet him .
`` The Russians , '' he shouts , `` take courses .
But simulators are n't enough .
I prefer experience .
'' He slaps his thigh .
`` Practical experience .
'' He is 48 , in khakis and sunglasses , has commanded supertankers on the high seas and has steered ships through the Bosporus by the thousand .
But only half of all captains coming through the strait ask for this inexpensive and expert help ; most who do n't are Russian .
In three-quarters of the strait 's crackups , neither ship has had a pilot on board .
The Nassia did n't .
She was riding low in these waters -- as the Seavinha is now -- awaiting a pilot .
The freighter that broadsided her had cleared the strait and dropped its pilot off .
With both ships pilotless , it seems , someone lost control .
As Mr. Oztaskin reaches the bridge , the captain of the Seavinha gives up control willingly .
`` Would you like some drinks ?
'' says Haralabos Fikaris , a Greek in shorts and a knit shirt .
This is his fourth Bosporus passage in command .
He turns to order soda just as a big yellow blip pops up on the radar screen .
It looks as if the Seavinha is about to be swamped , but the blip is a false echo from a power line overhead , the curse of ignorant captains .
Facing forward , Mr. Oztaskin takes no notice .
`` Port 10 , '' he tells the Filipino wheelman , who says , `` Port 10 now , sir ?
'' Mr. Oztaskin says , `` Yep .
'' Europe 's shore is 200 yards off .
Boys dive from the wall into wind-ruffled water .
Fishing boats , going the wrong way , slide between the ship and the boys .
`` We hug the coast here , '' says the pilot .
`` Do n't worry .
It 's deep .
'' The Seavinha , Cypriot-flagged , has a 33-foot draft .
It is 620 feet long and 25 years old .
If Turkey had its way , a ship this size and age would be close to the outer limit for Bosporus transit .
`` What is the cargo , again ?
'' asks Mr. Oztaskin as Capt. Fikaris returns with a tray of Cokes .
`` Fuel oil , '' says the captain .
The pilot frowns and says , `` Black product .
'' In Turkey 's eyes , any color oil is black .
It would rather see none at all in the straits , a view that suits the oily politics of Russia 's southern flank .
While Western companies push to get pumping in the multibillion-dollar fields of Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan , Russia and Turkey -LRB- and even Iran -RRB- are angling to move the oil out .
Turkey wants it piped to its own ports on the Mediterranean .
Russia wants it shipped from its terminals on the Black Sea .
The nation that gets the high-priced business will also gain the political upper hand .
In early 1993 , Turkey and Azerbaijan signed a pipeline deal .
But before it could take off , the Turkish-friendly Azeri president was ousted by a Russian-friendly replacement .
Two months later , as it happened , Turkey announced its eco-friendly plan to restrict tanker traffic and rescue Istanbul from oil spills .
Maybe its motive was ulterior , but a decade from now an extra 27 billion gallons of oil a year could still be surging out of Central Asia .
Even the oil companies have backed a size limit for ships in the Bosporus .
For them , as for Turkey 's pilots , the puzzle is an old one : How can so many big ships fit through the neck of one bottle ?
`` Collision Warning , '' says the flashing red box that has appeared on the Seavinha 's radar screen .
A Turkish sand carrier dead ahead is taking a hard right turn around Koybasi Cape , going at seven knots ; the tanker is moving up on her at 10 knots .
Turkey 's new rules forbid overtaking on corners .
Mr. Oztaskin raises his binoculars .
`` Seems we are getting closer and closer , '' he says .
He grabs the radio and tells the Turkish captain to make his turn and then pull over to let the Seavinha pass .
First , the pilot must make the turn himself .
It is tricky .
When supertankers round these bends , their sterns fly into the oncoming lane ; that is why Turkey is keeping other vessels out of the strait as big ships go through .
But every ship has the currents to cope with .
`` Starboard 10 , '' says the pilot .
As the Seavinha swings , the surface current nudges her stern ; the bottom current plays with her bow ; countercurrents blend into the swirling circle of a whirlpool .
Mr. Oztaskin feels his way forward , but when the wind rises and these currents race , Turkey 's rules wo n't allow even its own pilots to navigate the strait .
The pilot says , `` Rudder amidships .
'' The Seavinha has just slipped past the sand carrier when Mr. Oztaskin makes contact with that Russian freighter .
Rounding Akinti Cape , he catches sight of her .
`` I 've seen you , '' he radios .
`` You can proceed .
'' The ships pass each other above the Bosporus Bridge .
Beyond it , the domes and minarets of the Golden Horn come into view .
In between lies the obstacle course of Istanbul 's harbor traffic .
A million people commute across the strait each morning .
A million commute back each afternoon .
The rules warn ferries never to cross a ship 's bow ; they try anyway , at full throttle , then quit if they ca n't make it .
Foreign captains do n't know that .
Fishing boats congregate by the score , with motors running , and dart out of the way at the last moment .
Foreigners do n't know that , either .
Capt. Fikaris watches Mr. Oztaskin sail through the swarm to the spot off Topkapi Palace where he will disembark .
`` Always necessary to get a pilot in this passage , '' the captain says .
`` Always .
'' The pilot radios the ship 's estimated arrival time at the Dardanelles , nine hours away .
Turkey and the IMO both `` strongly recommend '' that ships take pilots there , too .

James Treybig is a reluctant cannibal .
For two decades , the president and chief executive of Tandem Computers Inc. built his company 's fortunes on a simple formula : Design powerful , refrigerator-sized computers that work only with one another and sell them to corporate customers for the highest possible prices .
When revenue skidded last year , Mr. Treybig was backed into a corner .
His boss , Tandem Chairman Thomas Perkins , the biggest individual stockholder , was considering firing him .
His customers were screaming for lower prices .
In the end , Mr. Treybig was forced to adopt a strategy that could save or sink the Cupertino , Calif. , company he had founded 20 years ago .
The strategy is cannibalism : gutting an existing product line , even when it is selling well , by introducing better versions for competitive prices -- then slashing prices on the old line .
The attitude is described succinctly by a successful practitioner at rival Hewlett-Packard Co. `` When you are at the top , you have to have the courage to say , ` I have to stop investing in this great product , and I 'm going to use the money to generate a new product that will kill it , ' '' says Willem Roelandts , the head of H-P 's computer business .
`` If you 're not doing that , let me tell you , there 's going to be some competitor that 's going to do it for you .
'' This `` we eat our young '' tactic is n't entirely new .
As far back as a century ago , Procter & Gamble Co. began introducing new-and-improved versions of its detergents to gain market share .
But in the past decade , increased competition and shorter product cycles have made cannibalizing a means of survival , especially in the hypercompetitive world of computers and consumer electronics .
To keep up , high-tech companies must constantly find ways to cut costs and prices while marketing new products that eventually destroy their own previous creations .
The goal : generate profits from volume and manufacturing efficiency , not from artificially high prices that mask fat costs .
`` High prices are like drugs , '' Mr. Treybig says now .
`` You can get hooked on them .
'' Giants such as Intel Corp. , Motorola Inc. and H-P are accomplished cannibals .
H-P , which dominates the world market for computer printers , introduced its black and white DeskJet 500 model in 1990 at $ 729 .
Even as sales soared , H-P cut prices .
In 1993 , the company rolled out an inexpensive new color model , eventually slashing the old DeskJet to $ 365 .
But most high-tech companies are n't good cannibals .
Far more typical are the likes of International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. , which lost much of their business to smaller competitors because they were n't aggressive in developing machines that would render their mainframes obsolete .
The main reason companies delay and dither is a grim mathematical one : Replacing a product line with one that is priced at a fraction of the previous one means a company must cut costs and keep its work force lean while ramping up sales .
Often the new product is so different , or the new price so low , that the company has to reinvent itself and find new markets .
The question Tandem faces is whether a high-tech company that grew fat on lack of competition can become a successful cannibal .
As Mr. Treybig has learned , making the switch at a rather late date is a harrowing and wrenching process .
Over the past two years , he has had to fire friends , swallow pride and destroy parts of what he created .
And it wo n't get better .
If Mr. Treybig succeeds -- he promises to come out with low-priced , more-powerful computers every 15 months , and to increase unit sales by at least 36 % this year and next -- he will have simply won a spot on a treadmill of unceasing innovation , anemic profit margins and penurious cost controls .
If Tandem can stay upright , it will survive -- but it will thrive only if it can set the pace .
Mr. Treybig , 53 years old , started Tandem in 1974 with a $ 1 million check from Mr. Perkins , a venture capitalist .
By 1990 , he was sitting atop a business with $ 1.9 billion in annual revenue and a solid list of blue-chip customers .
He got there by selling a hot product that his customers told him they could n't live without : `` fault-tolerant '' computers , designed to keep working and protect data even during power outages or natural disasters .
Banks , telephone companies and stock exchanges stake their businesses on Tandem computers ' ability to process millions of transactions , 24 hours a day , without a glitch .
A single Tandem failure , even for an instant , could paralyze thousands of automated-teller machines or derail an entire city 's phone calls .
Mr. Treybig enjoys pointing this out .
`` You better pray for us .
The day we ` re not here , the stock markets of the world stop , '' he recently told a group of hospital executives in Seattle .
Playing on that fear , and on the fact that his multimillion-dollar computers worked only with one another , Mr. Treybig charged hefty premiums for his products , and got away with it .
Throughout the 1980s , Tandem enjoyed profit margins as high as 19.4 % , on par with then-powerhouse IBM .
Tandem 's sales force had one of the richest compensation plans in the industry .
Salesman Pete Engel recalls buying a new Mazda RX7 every year .
`` We used to be able to sell one machine a year and have a pretty nice living on it , '' he says .
It is at this point , when profits are plentiful , that successful cannibals introduce the next generation for a slight premium and slash prices on the older line .
But Tandem did n't .
Woozy from success , it expanded into new markets , where fault tolerance was n't needed and would n't command a premium .
Instead of cannibalizing , it kept prices high , figuring customers would be mollified by excellent quality .
While competitors were beginning to build their systems to run Unix , a popular operating system , Tandem stubbornly stuck to its proprietary system , called Guardian .
The advantage of Unix is that it is `` open '' -- it runs on many brands of computers .
A customer who writes a program for Unix on one computer can run it on any other computer running Unix .
The customer can switch to cheaper computers as they hit the market without losing its investment in software .
But a program written for Guardian could only run on Tandem computers .
Tandem 's first warning came in 1989 , from a major long-distance company that had bought $ 100 million of Tandem gear over the years .
Two of the customer 's senior vice presidents told Tandem their company had decided to write its future software for Unix .
If Tandem could n't run Unix , the company would take its business to DEC. .
`` We were pretty shocked , '' says William Heil Jr. , a Tandem executive .
Meeting with the phone-company executives , the Tandem team tried to talk them out of using Unix .
But the guests began screaming , asking how Tandem could be so blind , Mr. Heil recalls .
Before the meeting ended , he says , `` we were screaming at each other .
'' Rattled , Mr. Heil and his colleague discussed whether it was possible to meet the long-distance company 's demand .
One scenario was to make Guardian open , so it could run on any Unix machine .
Mr. Treybig 's response : `` Open is death .
'' Running Unix would make Tandem computers a commodity , he complained , forcing the company to compete with many others on price and features .
Tandem chose instead to go halfway : It made a low-end computer that could run Unix .
High-end machines would continue to run Guardian .
But Tandem 's biggest customers , who use high-end machines , continued to clamor for Unix -- and began replacing Tandem computers with models from H-P , DEC and others .
In 1991 , one of Tandem 's biggest accounts , Wells Fargo & Co. , threatened to defect .
That year , Tandem reported its first-ever quarterly loss .
But rather than redesign its computers and cut prices , it took another half-measure : layoffs .
Chairman Perkins walked Tandem 's hallways , soliciting executives for names of people to fire , and gave the list to Mr. Treybig , who successfully defended many on the list .
But he reluctantly agreed to cut the work force by 6 % , about 700 workers .
Mr. Treybig says he cried over some firings .
But he also felt bad about not having done some earlier .
`` What I realized is that if I did n't do my job , no one would have a job , '' he says .
Tandem 's financials brightened briefly .
But by early 1993 , it was clear that cost-cutting alone was n't enough .
In the third quarter , year-over-year revenue growth -- once in the double-digits -- shriveled to 2 % .
At the time , Tandem was developing a new computer , code-named Himalaya , with twice the power of the Cyclone , then the high-end model .
A good cannibal would have immediately announced the new product and slashed prices on the old one .
Instead , Tandem decided to continue to milk the Cyclone until the Himalaya was ready to ship in late 1993 .
When Mr. Treybig revealed this timetable to META Group Inc. , a Westport , Conn. , research firm , in the spring of 1993 , he got a tongue lashing .
The delay in slashing Cyclone prices `` sounded like a voice from IBM 's playbook four years ago , '' says Nili Young , then a META analyst .
`` He was n't in a position to wait .
His customers were n't in a position to wait .
'' She warned Mr. Treybig that two big London banks planned to stop buying from Tandem as soon as they could .
The meeting finally pushed Mr. Treybig to gut his old product line and embrace cannibalism .
Breaking with company tradition , he announced the Himalaya immediately , five months before it existed , promising that a new design would allow prices of one-third to one-sixth those of comparable machines in the older line .
And by late 1995 , the machines would run either Unix or Guardian .
To keep the older Cyclone line moving , Mr. Treybig slashed prices and offered special discounts to Cyclone buyers who wanted to upgrade to Himalayas later .
To make up for the lost revenue , Mr. Treybig cut every employee 's pay , including his own , by 5 % , and nixed merit raises .
Steeled by the 1992 layoffs , he savaged the family culture he had spent two decades nurturing and made plans to cut 1,500 more jobs by 1995 .
The cost : a restructuring charge of $ 451 million .
He had little choice .
`` You ca n't go on just slowly dying , you have to fix , '' Mr. Treybig says .
Convincing his sales force of the need to cannibalize was tough .
He was asking them to sell twice the number of computers for lower commissions and pay .
Several sales representatives tried to convince Gerald Peterson , general manager of sales , that there was no pressure to cut prices .
At a sales meeting in Europe , Mr. Peterson recalls , representatives told him the cuts were `` a crazy American idea .
'' Mr. Peterson told them , `` If we do n't do this , we are going to be out of business .
'' As for compensation , Tandem salespeople remain among the highest paid in the industry , earning $ 100,000 to $ 400,000 a year , he says .
Tandem buttressed its product strategy with new ads .
Out went the splashy but cryptic customer testimonials , replaced by plain ads comparing costs between Tandem and competitors .
The strategy appears to be working .
Customers now can buy a low-end Himalaya for $ 339,000 -- when a low-end Cyclone sold for $ 900,000 six months ago .
And a high-end Himalaya sells for $ 700,000 , compared with $ 4 million for a machine of the same power a year ago .
Because of the price cuts , Tandem now is being considered for uses it was n't even asked to bid on before .
Rabobank NV in the Netherlands , which was about to cancel an order for Cyclones when Tandem slashed prices last year , is now considering buying a Himalaya .
In the fiscal third quarter ended June 30 , Tandem added 76 new accounts , including Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Ltd. , a British wireless concern , and Pick 'n Pay Stores Ltd. , a major South African retailer .
In the third quarter , Tandem sold more than 500 of its high-end Himalayas , about double the number sold in each of the first two periods ; it hopes to have profit margins of 8 % .
The result : Tandem is promising record earnings this fiscal year -LRB- the current record is $ 1.17 a share in 1989 -RRB- .
Internally , the bar is higher .
Mr. Treybig calls this fiscal year the `` $ 1.30 year .
'' Looking back on the angst it took to get to this point , Mr. Treybig concedes he should have moved faster .
`` There 's no question we made a mistake .
We would have been better off to go for low-priced systems .
'' In Europe , where markups were especially high , he says , `` we were raping the customer .
'' If Mr. Treybig can pull off this cannibalization , Tandem would be the first old-line computer company to reinvent itself successfully .
But if he fails , he could lose his job , and with it , the only life he has known for 20 years .
Says Chairman Perkins : `` We 're not married to Jimmy .
'' The battle is hardly over .
Customers are pressing for even lower prices .
And while Mr. Treybig dallied , competitors made big inroads .
Wells Fargo , for instance , bought a lot of Hewlett-Packards .
If Tandem `` delivers what they say they 're going to deliver , they 'll be competitive , '' says Barry Lynn , Wells Fargo 's executive vice president of customer information .
`` Will they be able to break the existing strongholds of some of their competitors ?
'' he continues .
`` That would take a fortuneteller to predict .
'' Your June 29 article on Texas ' environmental legislation -LRB- `` Have All Those ` Green ' Laws Helped ?
'' -RRB- failed to point out some of the gains made since Senate Bill 1340 was enacted .
Because paper represents almost 40 % of the waste stream heading to the landfill , increasing workplace recycling could clearly make a positive environmental impact .
But office recycling has long been a tedious process that required careful separation at each desk .
Both the Lower Colorado River Authority and the Office of the Attorney General in Austin have found new recycling programs that will help them reach the goals of Senate Bill 1340 while making recycling simple for their employees .
Many private-sector companies and commercial office buildings have found easy-to-use programs that recycle more than 50 % of what they were previously sending straight to the landfill .
Many of the grumblings of failure you hear about recycling come from people who simply have n't found the right system yet or are waiting for the government to impose a solution .
Private-sector solutions already exist that can make the recycling goals of Senate Bill 1340 a reality .
Most of Texas let out a sigh of relief when the strike at American Airlines ended .
But not Paris .
Or Lake Jackson .
Or Del Rio .
That 's because in these places -- as in much of rural and small-town Texas -- getting from Point A to Point B is always a struggle , a constant test of wills against scanty schedules , impossible connections -- or no connections at all .
Just yesterday , Paris became the sixth Texas town to lose air service completely since 1985 , as Lone Star Airlines canceled its three daily flights to the town of 25,000 people .
Now , the bad news : All the signs indicate that things will only get worse .
Consider : -- American Eagle , the commuter-airline affiliate of American Airlines , plans to get rid of many of its smallest planes .
That puts towns served by those 19-seat aircraft , such as Bryan\/College Station and San Angelo , on the air-service endangered list .
-- More than a dozen independent commuter airlines in the state have gone out of business or have been taken over by larger airlines during the past decade .
Now , the two that remain -- Conquest Airlines Corp. and Lone Star -- are either in the red or surviving on federal subsidies that have been targeted for cutbacks .
-- Southwest Airlines Co. does n't plan to add any more Texas cities to its flight schedule , preferring to focus expansion on out-of-state markets .
-- Diminished service is n't just an issue for the smallest towns .
In August , for instance , American eliminated its jet service to Midland\/Odessa and Lubbock ; instead , American Eagle now flies 34-seat propeller planes to these cities .
Southwest still serves the cities with jets , but it has n't expanded its schedule to make up for the lost American flights .
Although access to air service is an issue for small towns everywhere , it 's particularly critical in Texas -- a state as large as New England , New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio and Illinois combined .
`` I really think the canceled service is going to hurt , '' says Paris Mayor George Fisher .
`` If we want to bring someone in to look at a local business , we do n't have air service .
I guess they 'll have to rent a car or drive , and that 's bad .
'' Mike Young , president of Chuy 's - Comida Deluxe Inc. in Austin , is a case in point .
Mr. Young says he will only locate his restaurants in cities served by Southwest Airlines .
`` If we were looking at a city that was a three-hour drive from Austin , and did n't have regular air service , we would n't consider it , '' he says .
`` It 's one of the primary concerns in our location decisions .
'' Little wonder , then , that some communities have resorted to cash incentives to woo commercial airlines .
Before Conquest Airlines began service to Sugarland near Houston in November , the city promised $ 515,000 in marketing funds , three months of free terminal space , and no landing fees for six months .
Similarly , three years ago , Nacogdoches raised $ 45,000 to convince Conquest to provide service to Austin , and used the funds to subsidize any flights with less than nine passengers .
But after 18 months , Conquest moved out for lack of business .
Now , after a lobbying effort by Nacogdoches and Lufkin , which have a combined population of about 110,000 , Lone Star Airlines is promising service from Nacogdoches to D\/FW Airport beginning in March .
`` It 's a tremendous issue when you live in rural Texas , '' says Nacogdoches Mayor Judy McDonald .
`` In order to fly , I 've got to drive a minimum of two hours to reach an airport that will fly me anywhere .
'' No one in Texas is more excited about the Nacogdoches\/Lufkin air service than Chicago executive Howard Kerr .
Mr. Kerr visits his company 's Nacogdoches poultry plant , Green Acre Foods Inc. , twice a month .
But to get there , he leaves Chicago at 8 a.m. for D\/FW Airport , then catches a flight to Shreveport .
From there , he hops in a car and drives two hours to the poultry plant , arriving well after 3 p.m. `` The most difficult , time-consuming , personal logistics problem I have in managing this company is to get from the Chicago area to Nacogdoches , '' says Mr. Kerr .
`` If you do n't have a private plane , it 's very difficult to get there .
And it takes just as much time to leave .
'' Still , convincing the airline to show up is half the battle .
You also have to keep it there .
American Eagle , for instance , now serves 15 Texas cities .
But the airline is buying 20 planes that seat 64 people apiece , while getting rid of about the same number of its 19-seat aircraft .
Airline-industry experts think that other airlines will sell off their smallest planes , and subsequently abandon some of the smaller markets .
`` They 're not going to be interested in those kinds of markets , '' predicts Michael J. Boyd , president of Aviation Systems Research Corp. , a Golden , Colo. , research and consulting firm .
For its part , American Eagle is n't making any promises .
`` There 's no way we can carve any of our schedules in stone , '' says a spokesman .
`` We believe in all the markets we 're serving ... Our intent is to stay forever .
But circumstances change , markets change , and the industry changes .
'' So , is there any hope ?
The best chance for improved air service , most people agree , rests with the entrepreneurs who will look to go where nobody else wants to .
For the moment , that means Lone Star and Conquest .
`` We 're positioning ourselves to try to fill the void , '' says Phil Trenary , president and chief executive officer of Lone Star Airlines , which is based in Fort Worth .
Filling the void , however , has n't proved easy .
Since abandoning Paris , Lone Star provides service from D\/FW Airport to only two other Texas cities -- Brownwood and Alpine .
But the Brownwood service is only economically viable because the airline receives a $ 401,000 federal subsidy .
The subsidy -- part of a program to provide air service to communities that need it for economic reasons -- has been targeted for cutbacks by Vice President Al Gore .
In fact , it was the loss of a $ 377,000 subsidy for the Paris route that prompted Lone Star to abandon that market .
Without the subsidy , Lone Star officials say , the airline ca n't afford to fly the route .
They have appealed the government 's decision ; the feds , they say , have underestimated the number of passengers , thereby overstating the per-passenger subsidy .
They also argue that the government has underestimated the importance of small communities to the state 's economy .
`` By maintaining service to small communities in Texas , '' Mr. Trenary says , `` it 's good for the economic base of the whole state .
'' Then there 's Conquest Airlines , which started flying in 1988 and now serves 10 Texas cities .
The Austin-based airline promises more new service announcements this month .
The company also is planning service from Laredo , San Antonio and McAllen to Monterrey , Mexico .
But Conquest 's financial health does n't inspire confidence .
The company has reported net losses in four of the past five years ; the one profitable year resulted from a lawsuit settlement .
During the latest fiscal quarter ended Aug. 31 , Conquest reported an operating loss of $ 1.6 million , or 11 cents per share , on sales of $ 2.8 million .
Conquest Chairman Victor Rivas says those numbers will improve when the airline stops spending money on expansion .
He insists that Conquest will succeed where others have failed , because his company does n't feed into a hub , where passengers have to transfer to a connecting flight .
Instead , Conquest focuses on point-to-point service , such as Corpus Christi to Austin .
Although other carriers serve the two cities , Conquest is the only one to provide direct , nonstop service .
Still , because of the time and investment it takes to start a new route , even Mr. Rivas concedes life for the rural Texas commuter could get worse before it gets better -- and it may not get better at all .
`` We 've got people calling us from all these cities wanting service , '' says Mr. Rivas , who notes that four Texas towns currently are offering the airline financial incentives to begin service .
`` But we can only expand at a certain rate .
And with what 's happening in the industry , it 's only going to get worse for them .
In some places , the economics are not there , and you just ca n't justify it .
'' WASHINGTON -- Forty-one Senate Republicans , enough to block a $ 30.2 billion crime bill , have said they will do just that unless Democrats agree to change the legislation .
In a letter to Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole , 40 Republicans said they would `` support you and vote against the motion '' that would allow consideration of the measure passed by the House on Sunday .
The Republicans want to kill the ban on semi-automatic assault weapons included in the bill , cut its spending for crime prevention and strengthen law-enforcement provisions .
After meeting with Sen. Dole , Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell , said he was willing to schedule separate votes on 13 changes suggested by GOP senators , but only after there is a vote on the pending bill .
Sen. Dole , a Kansas Republican , said he would discuss that with his Republican colleagues , but added , `` It 's probably a nonstarter .
'' If the current negotiations fail , the GOP may attempt to block the bill with a parliamentary move called a budget point of order .
They would need 41 votes to sustain such a move , and the letter suggests they have them .
Mr. Mitchell said Mr. Dole wants the Senate to be able to amend the House-passed version of the bill , and would agree to limit the number of amendments and the time to be spent debating them .
He said they also would agree to a vote on stopping debate on the bill after the amendment process .
Stopping debate would require 60 votes , the same number required to defeat the threatened GOP parliamentary move .
Democrats are eager to avoid amending the bill because doing so would require sending it back to the House .
The arduous 10-day struggle between the time the legislation was blocked in the House on procedural grounds and its final passage on Sunday demonstrates the difficulties that would arise if the Senate amends the bill .
When asked if he had 60 votes to block the Republican move , Sen. Mitchell said , `` I do n't know .
That depends how Republican senators would vote .
'' He said `` all or almost all '' 56 Senate Democrats would oppose the latest GOP parliamentary move .
A Clinton administration aide said the Democrats on Monday night had three Republicans , and possibly a fourth , who agreed to vote with the Democrats to block the GOP tactic .
But by noon yesterday , none of those votes seemed assured .
It 's possible that not all 40 senators who signed the letter to Mr. Dole will , in fact , support the parliamentary move .
A few GOP members may have signed the letter to force the Democratic leadership to enter negotiations designed to generate changes the Republicans favor .
Calling the power games being played over the crime bill `` high-stakes poker , '' Sen. Nancy Kassebaum -LRB- R. , Kan. -RRB- said she signed the letter to encourage the Democratic leadership to enter negotiations with GOP leaders on changing the crime bill .
If Sen. Mitchell allows a vote on even five of the amendments sought by the GOP , Sen. Kassebaum said , she would consider that a `` good-faith effort '' and then vote against the point of order .
Sen. Mitchell would have to gamble , she noted , on which amendments to allow a vote on .
If he were to pick any that subsequently are approved , the legislation would have to be returned to the House for what could again be a turbulent process .
Morris `` Moe '' Berg was many things to many people : Renaissance man , exotic infielder , wartime spy and dapper hobo .
How this son of struggling Ukrainian Jewish immigrants won the hearts and minds of so many worldly people but died so broke and forlorn is an American myth that persists 22 years after his death and leaves no tempered feelings : Berg aficionados still either love or pity him .
As Nicholas Dawidoff shows in his perceptive biography , `` The Catcher Was a Spy : The Mysterious Life of Moe Berg '' -LRB- Pantheon , 453 pages , $ 24 -RRB- , the extravagant Berg did plenty to encourage both camps .
His curious life began in 1902 : Born to a father who spoke six languages but banned Yiddish from his Newark , N.J. , home , Moe attended New York University and Princeton .
He excelled in modern languages , played shortstop and began concocting for himself a learned , even dashing , public persona while remaining pathologically secretive about his private comings and goings .
After graduation in 1923 , Berg joined the Brooklyn Robins , the first of a succession of major-league teams he served as a utility infielder .
His teammates around the leagues knew Berg only as the urbane , brainy Ivy League product who read 10 newspapers a day -LRB- in a time when this was still possible -RRB- and disappeared from view the moment he was showered and dressed in his stiff black suit .
After three years Berg took himself to Columbia Law School in the off-season , and later worked for a Wall Street firm run by J.P. Morgan 's son-in-law .
But summers were still for baseball , and for sportswriters his weird discourses on linguistics and curveballs made for dream interviews .
His resulting fame put Berg on chatting terms with the likes of Nelson Rockefeller , who offered Berg a chance to be professionally secretive .
And so in 1942 , his professional playing days over , Moe Berg joined Rocky at the Office of Inter-American Affairs , talking up American sports and fitness in Latin America .
He proved himself as skilled and affable in foreign lands as at stateside dinner parties , and soon , with typical cockiness , offered his services to the Office of Strategic Services , a spook organization with a bohemian streak .
John Ford and Toscanini 's daughter were also on the payroll .
Even so , it is somewhat astounding to read that it was Berg who was sent to Naples to find out what exactly physicist Werner Heisenberg was doing with all the heavy water he was getting from Norway .
Berg never did find out , but he had a great time in Europe , judging by Mr. Dawidoff 's finely researched account of his wartime travels to Naples , Morocco , Paris and elsewhere .
In Zurich , he spent several months on the OSS 's tab , telling exotic tales and making a lot of famous friends -LRB- including Heisenberg -RRB- .
In 1946 , eager to wrest his expense account from him , his superiors finally pushed him out with a Medal of Freedom .
Berg never worked again .
As Mr. Dawidoff shows , he much preferred a life of freeloading -LRB- and disappearing -RRB- among socialites , former ballplayers and sportswriters up and down the East Coast .
There was always someone rich and\/or famous willing to offer the entertaining -LRB- and frequently broke -RRB- enigma a place to sleep for a night or a week ; Berg would move right in , always careful to rinse his one white nylon shirt every evening .
As his ramblings began to wear on his hosts and his health , Berg became a burden to his brother , Sam , at whose Newark house he stayed several years too long ; from there he went to his sister , Ethel , at whose New York City home he suffered an aneurysm that killed him , in 1972 .
Sam and Ethel squabbled over his ashes and , fittingly , no one knows where Moe Berg rests .
For those now obsessing over baseball players ' salaries , two new books take us back to 1964 , when hard-drinking divo of the diamond Mickey Mantle 's wage was $ 100,000 .
David Halberstam 's `` October 1964 '' -LRB- Villard , 380 pages , $ 24 -RRB- tells how the St. Louis Cardinals ended the New York Yankees ' perennial grip on the World Series .
The story unfolds the way any summer should -- as a long , simmering prelude for an October that glistens and is gone .
And the book also includes the late Cardinals owner August Busch Sr. 's timely excoriation of uppity players : `` Fans are telling us now that if we intend to raise prices to pay for the high salaries and so on and on , they will stop coming to the games , they will not watch and will not listen .
'' Philip Bashe 's `` Dog Days : The New York Yankees ' Fall From Grace and Return to Glory , 1964-1976 '' -LRB- Random House , 411 pages , $ 25 -RRB- takes the long view , starting with the Yankees ' last World Series for more than a decade and tracing , year by year , their long trudge through the wilderness and back again to October baseball .
In all that time , of course , there were plenty of viewers and listeners to keep their loudmouthed boss , George Steinbrenner , clothed and overfed .
Your July 20 page-one article , `` Respect for Diet Pills Rises as Studies Shed New Light On Obesity , '' said '' ... a growing consensus holds that the traditional approach to weight loss -- diet and exercise -- is futile for the majority of people .
'' The ratio between energy input -LRB- diet -RRB- and output -LRB- exercise -RRB- continues to be the dynamic that determines body-weight fluctuations for most people .
The exception could be the very obese .
Since most drug protocols focus on this population , perhaps you meant this is a consensus regarding that distinct population .
Furthermore , if you were to canvass professionals about the July 20 Journal of the American Medical Association report on the epidemic of weight gain in this country , you would find their response is we need to encourage the public to strive for a healthier weight , not discourage them .
To say modifying diet and exercise to achieve weight loss is futile implies we are victims of some outside force when , in fact , we shape our health destiny by the conscious choices we make about eating and exercise .
In today 's culture it would seem that engendering personal responsibility is more useful than supporting a victim consciousness .
WASHINGTON -- White House officials are increasingly pessimistic about their chances of salvaging significant health-care legislation from Congress this year .
The continued partisan confrontation over the crime bill has cost the administration critical time and energy .
And as the health debate has moved to the right , officials acknowledge it is harder to hold Democrats together and produce a bill that President Clinton could sign .
Coming into this month , the White House had hoped to show some early momentum in the Senate and so fortify supporters in the House .
Instead , the House has gone home after a rancorous fight over the crime bill .
And even if the Democratic leadership breaks through the current health impasse in the Senate , the administration worries that the bill that emerges will be too weak to be embraced by Mr. Clinton .
These doubts have grown since the announcement last week of a compromise plan crafted by a bipartisan bloc of Senate moderates , many of whom once embraced the president 's goal of universal health-care coverage .
The new proposal instead puts a higher priority on deficit reduction and dramatizes how support has deteriorated for any system of costly subsidies to help poor and working-class families buy private coverage .
Although the administration is still pursuing a compromise with the so-called mainstream coalition , some officials are beginning to question whether the potential deal is so far short of the president 's goals that it is n't worth accepting .
`` At some point you have to say , what are we getting out of this ?
'' said one administration official .
`` We 're getting close to that .
'' One of the president 's close allies , House Speaker Thomas Foley , reflected the soured hopes at a breakfast meeting with reporters .
' I think we have two choices , '' the Washington Democrat said .
Congress can either try to pass scaled-back legislation that takes steps toward the goals of universal coverage and cost containment , or it can give up this year and take up the issue next year , he said .
`` What I do n't think we want to do , '' the speaker said , `` is just put something together that does n't really do anything at all and say this is health-care reform in order to satisfy the public that we 've done something .
'' While the crime bill consumed most of the Senate 's time yesterday , Majority Leader George Mitchell and the leaders of the mainstream group , Sens. John Chafee -LRB- R. , R.I. -RRB- and John Breaux -LRB- D. , La. -RRB- , and their staffs continued to work to forge common ground .
Democrats last night were hopeful still of reaching an agreement with the moderates whereby major elements of their plan would be accepted by the leadership and some points of difference left to floor votes .
The mainstream coalition is scheduled to meet this morning to discuss revisions that could affect its treatment of Medicare and Medicaid .
But Sen. John Danforth -LRB- R. , Mo. -RRB- , a member of the coalition , said last night that even if the Democratic leaders embrace the entire package , it is doubtful a bill can be enacted this year .
`` This is , under the best of circumstances , a big drawn-out battle , '' said Mr. Danforth , `` And here we are past the middle of August .
'' While both the White House and Democratic leadership stressed that the moderates ' proposal contains a lot of good ideas , they have several grave problems that make reaching an agreement extremely difficult .
Most important , the moderates ' plan does n't come close to achieving universal coverage , by its authors ' own admission .
`` I would n't promise anyone 91 % coverage , '' said coalition member David Durenberger -LRB- R. , Minn. -RRB- of earlier claims that coverage would reach at least that level , and probably higher .
Mr. Durenberger was also cautious about the ability to finance the low-income subsidy program with savings from existing federal health programs .
`` I think we may be exaggerating to say we can subsidize up to 200 % of the poverty level without being irresponsible in savings from Medicaid and Medicare , '' he said .
And a new more detailed outline of the mainstream plan showed that the proposed vouchers for low-income people would be phased in much more slowly than the moderates had suggested earlier in the summer .
Officials say that for any bill to be acceptable to the president , it has to be a clear step toward his goal of universal coverage .
That means the White House is inclined to accept no less than some form of backup requirement that employers pay part of their workers ' health costs , in case market reforms do n't work .
But there are other equally tough problems .
The administration and its liberal allies are adamantly opposed to a provision in the mainstream plan that would limit employers ' ability to deduct the cost of providing health benefits to their workers and would subject certain generous benefits to taxation .
The market-oriented moderates , however , feel that such a provision is important to generating price-sensitivity in the medical market and containing costs .
The provision `` could be a real hang-up between both parties , '' said Sen. John Rockefeller -LRB- D. , W. Va. -RRB- , a strong Clinton ally .
The White House 's health-care efforts have been hindered recently by the president 's focus on the crime bill .
Meanwhile , Hillary Rodham Clinton has made a conscious effort to lie low , according to administration officials .
While Mrs. Clinton has appeared at some public events -- such as one last week highlighting the importance of covering children -- officials say that the first lady 's public image has been so distorted that she worries that her backing for any measure could hurt its chances .
The waning support for reform is best reflected in the back-and-forth among the moderates regarding what level of subsidies to offer lower-income families and how to integrate the system with Medicaid .
The group 's latest proposal would only reach families earning up to 150 % of the poverty line by the year 2001 ; an earlier version this summer set a ceiling of 240 % by that date .
Similarly , many of the same moderates had supported earlier proposals to bring Medicaid beneficiaries into the same voucher system .
Democratic and Republican governors are still lobbying for the idea .
But the mainstream group was shaken by the cost estimates , even though the Congressional Budget Office projects that the reform would result in long-term savings for the government .

In his Aug. 18 editorial-page article , `` No Way To Fight TB , '' Paul Dietrich voices criticisms of the World Health Organization .
We have answered many of these same criticisms before , but would like to respond specifically to his comments on tuberculosis .
In calling for donors to close their checkbooks to WHO tuberculosis-control efforts , Mr. Dietrich callously dismisses the fate of 30 million people who will die from TB in the next decade .
The battle against tuberculosis will be won or lost by those who hold the checkbooks , not the test tubes .
Medicines that are more than 95 % effective already exist to fight TB .
But governments and the private sector do not provide sufficient funding to establish effective TB control programs to provide these medicines .
WHO , more than any other institution or agency , has sounded the alarm about TB 's neglect and has taken the leadership to mobilize a response .
In March 1993 , WHO declared TB a global emergency .
Since 1992 , the WHO TB program has nearly doubled its budget , including the resources it spends to help establish TB-control programs in Asia and Africa .
Only 11 % of the program 's 1994-95 budget is devoted to administration and program-support costs .
The remainder is spent to establish effective TB-control programs in more parts of the world , and to help support important research projects such as the development of diagnostic methods and control strategies .
Even with limited resources , WHO 's success has been astounding .
For example , in China -- home to 25 % of the world 's TB cases -- the tuberculosis project is increasing cure-rates from less than 50 % to nearly 90 % , and could eventually save millions of lives .
But WHO can not prevent this epidemic alone ; as a United Nations organization , its budget reflects the priorities set by its member states .
Western nations , which provide the largest share of WHO 's budget , have placed a very low priority on fighting infectious diseases , especially TB .
Currently , less than 1.5 % of foreign-aid budgets world-wide are spent to fight infectious diseases such as tuberculosis , AIDS , malaria , leprosy , diarrhea , tropical diseases and childhood infections .
These diseases cause nearly one-third of all deaths in the developing world , killing over 13 million men , women and children each year .
WHO is calling on industrialized nations to provide at least $ 100 million in new money for TB control directly to less-developed nations -- not to WHO .
The WHO TB program requires only $ 11 million annually to provide the technical support to make sure nations use these resources effectively .
With this funding , we estimate that the number of TB deaths in the next decade could be cut in half .
My summer romance began back in April , when , in a burst of civic enthusiasm , I agreed to house and feed three 12-year-old boys for a week during the August Babe Ruth League Bambino World Series .
At the time it sounded like a good idea .
Nobody mentioned chauffeuring , tour guiding or cheering in 96-degree humidity .
But as a member of the Chamber of Commerce , I was aware of the tourist coup it was for Henderson to land one of the Babe Ruth League 's age-group national finals .
The players live with host families , but their parents and fans -LRB- old friends from St. Louis , cousins from Tennessee -- never underestimate the drawing power of a 12-year-old with a good arm -RRB- generate tourist dollars .
To snare this bambino bonanza , Henderson had to raise $ 140,000 to convert an old diamond into a state-of-the-art youth baseball stadium -LRB- lighting , covered stands , bathrooms and even pear trees -RRB- and to pay a fee to Babe Ruth , which organizes the tournament and provides airfare for nine 15-member teams , each team 's three volunteer coaches , and a set of five volunteer umpires .
Youth baseball is volunteer intensive : Babe Ruth claims 760,000 players and 1.5 million volunteers .
Little League , a parallel outfit , claims 2.5 million players and 800,000 volunteers .
In Henderson volunteers started stadium construction in deep snow during Christmas break ; the groundskeeper 's wife organized a townwide cleanup ; and my 90-year-old mother-in-law made a huge pile of cookies -LRB- one night 's worth -RRB- for my trio .
The whole town was determined to put its best foot forward .
Our house , where there has n't been a 12-year-old in residence for 15 years , drew two pitchers , Mike Baird and Richard Bartlett , and a second baseman , Jerame McKereghan , from the Kennewick -LRB- Wash. -RRB- All-Stars .
As we pulled into our driveway , they went wild : `` Fireflies !
You 've got fireflies !
'' After they located a jar , punched holes in the lid and captured their first specimen we unloaded their baggage and had our first crisis : Mike 's smaller bag was missing , the one with his uniform .
The kid should have come with a warning label : `` CAUTION , misplaces things .
'' The next crisis involved a malfunctioning toilet on a Delta flight out of Denver .
The delay caused Richard 's parents to miss their connection in Cincinnati and hence the Saturday game .
Every other player had parents present .
Saturday did not bode well from the beginning : My French toast was soggy .
Soaring , searing humidity engulfed the grand opening 's clouds of balloons , tons of popcorn , bushels of salted sunflower seeds and parachutists who neatly landed on the pitcher 's mound .
By evening there were 6,792 fans in attendance , a national record for Babe Ruth baseball .
Kennewick opened jumpy with a flustered Richard pitching .
Raleigh , N.C. , more acclimated to high temperatures and humidity , got on a roll .
The game ended Raleigh 7 , Kennewick 3 , but not before Mike came in and staunched the flow of runs and Jerame hit a double .
`` I guess we got to learn about the losers ' bracket , '' Mike moaned as we got in the car afterward .
These boys , the `` hotshots '' of their regular-season teams , had played together as an all-star team through three eliminations .
So `` losers '' was a new term for them .
At least we knew , in this double-elimination tournament , that there was some hope : If they could battle through the losers ' bracket , they 'd have a chance at the championship on Saturday .
Richard got in focus for the second game and pitched three innings , all flawless , and the game ended Kennewick 7 , Elk Grove -LRB- Calif. -RRB- 1 .
My decade-dormant motherhood genes kicked in and I started yelling -- not only at the games but also at home , about eating right and picking up crumbs and dirty clothes .
The series included two honorary teams : the host city 's all-stars and a team from abroad -- this year it was Guam .
After Henderson fell into the losers ' bracket opposite Kennewick I suffered trauma : how to yell for Richard on the mound when John Reid , who grew up next door , was trying to steal home .
That one ended Kennewick 14 , Henderson 1 .
Richard coached me into acceptable French toast , and I took him and Mike to the naturalist at Audubon State Park for a lesson about the sex life of that strange Midwestern creature , the firefly .
New Orleans , a big , hard-hitting team , fell next , 8-1 .
Richard and Mike declared that detergent might kill the winning streak , but Jerame quietly put his uniform in the washer .
Clean and dirty , they managed a 4-1 victory over Jefferson City , Mo. .
We took them out for steak to celebrate .
Friday night the moon was full , the boys hyper and the competition stiffer .
Kennewick squeaked by Hockessin , Del. , 3-2 .
That left Lexington between my boys and the 5-foot World Series trophy .
One victory would not do ; in this double-elimination tourney the losers ' bracket victor must defeat the winners ' bracket victor twice , in a doubleheader .
Lexington opened at bat with the confidence of top-of-the-world 12-year-olds backed by layers of stomping , shouting fans .
Drizzle , about as rare as fireflies in Kennewick , where the annual rainfall is six inches , began in the third inning .
Kennewick entered the bottom of the sixth -LRB- the final in 12-year-old play -RRB- trailing 7-4 .
And then came real rain and a dreamy , out-of-a-movie sequence .
Jerame hit a single and moved a man to second .
They both stole bases on a wild pitch , and another single brought them both in , to put them within a two points of a win .
Then , in a flash , two more runners made it home .
Victory !! Yes !! Fifteen minutes later the rerun started .
The Kennewick crowd stood soaked and shrieking in a little enclave close to the dugout and away from the covered stands .
My ears are permanently imprinted : Go Mike !
Go Jerame !
Go Richard !
Go Matt !
Go Marcus !
Go Brooksie and Josh !
On Mark and Tom , Brian and Bobby , Jason and Jim !
Go Eric !
Go Kevin !
And go they did : Kennewick 11 , Lexington 1 .
They took a piece of my heart back to Kennewick along with that 5-foot trophy .
I 'm saving another piece for the teachers who will face them next week .
Other World Series finals are scheduled for Saturday in Pine Bluff , Ark. -LRB- Babe Ruth , ages 13-15 -RRB- ; Wharton , Texas -LRB- Babe Ruth , 16-18 -RRB- ; and Williamsport , Pa. -LRB- Little League , all age groups -RRB- .
Ms. King is a writer in Henderson .
Swedish insurance group Trygg Hansa said its Chief Executive Bjoern Spraengare will resign once a successor has been named .
The company also announced a 79 % drop in first-half earnings , mainly due to substantial losses on the bond portfolio of its U.S. subsidiary , Home Holdings Inc. .
Mr. Spraengare has led the company through a series of major strategic failures since 1990 : a failed merger with life insurer SPP , the collapse of its banking subsidiary Gota Banken , the bankruptcy of its credit insurance unit , costly real-estate losses and the persistently disappointing performance of its U.S. affiliate , Home Holdings , which it acquired three years ago .
News of his departure sent Trygg Hansa shares up 5.3 % in early trading yesterday on the Stockholm exchange .
The shares later dropped back after the earnings announcement -LRB- and on news of another increase in Swedish interest rates -RRB- to end at 82 kroner -LRB- $ 11 -RRB- , 4 % below their previous close .
They 're at it again , and even earlier than usual .
Ignoring the traditional Labor Day campaign kickoff , Gov. Ann Richards , Republican challenger George W. Bush and even congressional candidate Eugene Fontenot have already begun airing television ads .
And that 's just the beginning .
`` There are a lot of big-spending , competitive races in Texas this year , '' says John Hutchens , president of Media Strategies & Research Inc. , a Washington , D.C. , media buying firm .
Mr. Hutchens predicts Texas campaigns ' spending on TV and radio ads will surpass $ 20 million -- second only to California races .
And just who are the brains behind the carefully crafted spots seeking to persuade voters ?
Most of the big races in Texas are relying on well-known Washington media consultants , while smaller campaigns -- and even some statewide races -- are hiring increasingly prominent Texas-based help .
Here 's a look at four key races : The man behind Ann Richards 's television ads this campaign is Bob Squier , a pricey beltway consultant whose negative spots are so effective that conservative talk-show host Mary Matalin calls him `` the Darth Vader of the Democrats .
'' During Ms. Richards 's successful 1990 race against millionaire oilman Clayton Williams , Mr. Squier patched together 30 seconds of Mr. Williams 's gaffes and ended with the query , `` Governor Williams ?
'' In another ad , he went too far and later apologized ; the spot showed a newspaper headline reading `` Lawsuits Allege Williams a ` Deadbeat ' '' -- but left off the last line of the headline , `` Richards discloses .
'' But Mr. Squier does n't seem to have the same touch with positive , image-building ads .
His 1990 commercials , including a primary spot that showed Ms. Richards with her grandchildren , failed to tell viewers anything they did n't already know , critics say .
And his first spot this year -- which began airing Aug. 10 and shows the governor walking through a classroom advocating teen curfews -- had ho-hum visuals , including a segment where her snowy hair is lost against a background of a white wall .
Mr. Bush 's campaign says it will run concept ads on such issues as crime and welfare reform , and does n't plan to go negative .
Running the TV operation is Don Sipple , another Washington consultant with a long pedigree .
But like Mr. Squier , he , too , has n't received raves for his early efforts .
Mr. Bush 's first ad , which began running Aug. 17 , is a 60-second hodgepodge of gory crime images and upbeat statements about the candidate 's Texas roots .
`` The text to me is a little confusing , '' says Republican media consultant David Weeks .
`` There 's a lot of stuff in that spot .
'' Ms. Richards 's second ad , which hit the airwaves last week , responds by highlighting how she cut back parole for criminals .
Her campaign also criticized the Bush spot as a `` cookie-cutter crime ad '' because it includes footage Mr. Sipple used in a California ad for Gov. Pete Wilson .
Messrs. Sipple and Squier have different strengths that should benefit their candidates , according to Denis Calabrese , a Houston-based Republican consultant .
`` Mr. Squier does better tough stuff -- and Ann Richards , who has already established herself with voters , needs a tough guy , '' Mr. Calabrese says .
`` Mr. Sipple does better positive stuff and , in theory , Mr. Bush needs a fluff guy to introduce himself .
I think they 've both got what they need .
'' Here 's a campaign for those who ca n't get enough saccharin .
Kay Bailey Hutchison has rehired Mr. Weeks , the Austin media consultant who helped her win last year 's special Senate election with the `` Breck girl '' ads , showing her looking soft , beautiful and caring at a time when she faced accusations that she had conducted personal business on state time , as well as smacked an employee .
Expect another round of the ads this fall .
Though people of all political persuasions ridicule them , the commercials -- one of which showed her walking against a backdrop of trees with the sun shining through her blond hair -- perhaps were n't as dumb as they may have looked .
`` Do n't kid yourself , they ` re effective , '' says George Shipley , a general strategic consultant for Gov. Richards 's campaign .
`` She 's a very believable visual character .
'' Just as many voters complain that Mrs. Hutchison and Mr. Fisher are too alike on the issues , their consultants have very similar styles .
Like Mr. Weeks , Mr. Fisher 's television manager , Washington-based Ray Strother , has done many smooth , feel-good spots , including one for Lloyd Bentsen on the then-senator restoring bus service to a rural town .
But he has also had some stumbles in recent years .
In an ad for Texas ' 1990 Democratic gubernatorial primary , he showed his client , former governor Mark White , walking through a picture gallery of death-row inmates executed while he was in office .
`` It was the theater of the absurd , '' says one political consultant .
`` Jim Mattox and Mark White got into a contest over who fried more people , and Ann Richards won .
'' Mr. Strother says that Mr. White was trailing in the polls when the ad aired , and that the ad helped slightly .
Political insiders say Mrs. Hutchison 's indictment wo n't be a big issue in the Fisher campaign 's ads , since she was acquitted .
Instead , Mr. Strother is likely to focus on her voting record .
`` If we do n't get a national health-care bill , Mrs. Hutchison will have to explain her vote , '' says Mr. Shipley , Gov. Richards 's general consultant .
`` She ran as an outsider against gridlock , and now she can be called upon '' to defend Congress 's inaction .
If the Senate campaign turns nasty , as expected , Mr. Strother and Mr. Weeks have ample experience on the negative side .
Mr. Strother created a Reagan-era spot for the Democratic Party in which a woman opens her mailbox only to find her Social Security check has n't arrived .
And Mr. Weeks is behind the celebrated 1992 spots that mocked Lena Guerrero , who -- after resigning as railroad commissioner amid allegations that she fibbed about having a college degree -- ran again for the seat against Barry Williamson .
The spots , which helped Mr. Williamson win , showed footage of Ms. Guerrero during a graduation speech and echoed her words , `` I remember my own commencement ... commencement ... commencement ... '' Forget fluffy hair and slick , polished images in this race , if the work of the media consultants involved is any guide .
Naked realism is more like it .
When real-estate developer Bob Lanier challenged five-term incumbent Republican Kathy Whitmire for the Houston mayoral spot in 1991 , media consultant Mark McKinnon stuck him in front of a camera in a blue sweater , his crooked teeth showing through an affable smile , promising `` a little common sense at City Hall .
'' Mr. Lanier won , and political insiders expect Mr. McKinnon to use a similar close-up style in this race , which has n't hit televisions yet .
He is working for incumbent Martha Whitehead , the former Longview mayor who promises to eliminate the treasurer 's office if she 's elected to the post to which Gov. Richards appointed her last year .
`` It 's going to be a single-message campaign , '' says Mr. McKinnon , based in Austin .
Republican challenger David Hartman , an Austin banker , has hired Fort Worth-based Bryan Eppstein .
Though an established general consultant , Mr. Eppstein has much less TV experience than Mr. McKinnon .
What he lacks in experience , he 'll try to make up for with toughness , hitting hard on Ms. Whitehead 's lack of financial qualifications for the job .
`` Bryan 's a bomb thrower , '' says Democratic political consultant Bill Miller .
`` He 'll go for the kill .
'' In a close 1988 race in which his client , Mount Pleasant Republican Bill Ratliff , snatched away incumbent Richard Anderson 's state senate seat , Mr. Eppstein 's Willie Hortenesque commercial showed a crowbar-wielding drug dealer looking through a living-room window , while the voice-over said that -- thanks to his opponent 's vote on a parole measure -- criminals would be `` home for Christmas .
'' The fight for the Houston-area seat that U.S. Rep. Mike Andrews is vacating ought to be interesting -- if only to watch Ken Bentsen , nephew of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , try to make every penny count in a head-to-head television battle with wealthy investor Eugene Fontenot .
According to Roll Call , a magazine that covers Congress , Mr. Fontenot outspent every congressional candidate in the U.S. during his $ 850,000 primary campaign .
Mr. Bentsen 's campaign -- which will probably seek to portray Mr. Fontenot as a right-wing religious zealot -- is counting on Rindy Media Inc. , an offbeat Austin firm , to make spots so memorable that it does n't matter if they run less often than the opposition 's .
Many of Rindy 's past spots used gimmicks like cartoons or old-time pictures to stand out from the clutter .
`` I prefer a stiletto to a meat ax anytime , '' says Dean Rindy , the firm 's owner .
During John Sharp 's successful bid for state comptroller in 1990 , a Rindy ad used a style reminiscent of silent movies to highlight a scandal involving opponent Warren G. Harding Jr. 's father .
The ad opened with a screen reading `` The Scam .
A True Story , '' then went on to show how Mr. Harding Sr. , a former state treasurer , allegedly coerced bankers to buy bonds from his son .
Mr. Rindy is pitted against Steve Sandler of Alexandria , Va. .
A veteran at running against incumbents , Mr. Sandler hints that he may try to define Mr. Bentsen , an investment banker , as `` a Democratic operative from a very political family .
'' His first Fontenot spots , which ran earlier this month , highlighted the candidate 's background as a businessman and civic volunteer , and showed him at a Houston D-day parade he `` rescued '' by donating $ 15,000 .
Now that the baseball strike prevents the teams from taking the field , fans are having a difficult time trying to figure out whom to cheer in the only game left in town -- the players versus the owners .
On one hand there are the spoiled players , who average $ 1.2 million a year and who condemn management 's proposal because it will allow them to earn `` only '' an average of $ 1.6 million by the year 2000 .
On the other hand , there are the owners , who claim poverty but wo n't open the books .
This is one contest that has plenty to boo and little to cheer .
All fans can really root for is a speedy end to the strike .
Sen. Howard Metzenbaum -LRB- D. , Ohio -RRB- thinks he has the winning solution : Enact legislation to subject baseball to the antitrust laws .
The legislation would reverse the 1922 Supreme Court decision in Federal Baseball Club v. National League , which held that baseball was not `` interstate commerce '' and therefore was not subject to the federal antitrust laws .
In the intervening 70 years , the Supreme Court has expanded the meaning of `` interstate commerce '' in other contexts to the point that baseball today should be covered .
Relying on the doctrine of stare decisis , which requires courts to abide by precedents , however , the Supreme Court has , on two occasions since 1922 , refused to overrule its Federal Baseball Club decision .
Most recently in 1972 , the court retired center fielder Curt Flood 's challenge to baseball 's `` reserve '' system , which for years had prevented players from changing teams .
Ironically , since the Flood decision , the baseball players ' union has developed into the most successful labor organization of professional athletes , even though baseball has continued to be the only professional sport not subject to the antitrust laws .
In the past 20 years , the union has forced the owners to abandon the reserve system .
The current system of free agency and arbitration that replaced it has rewarded players very handsomely .
Despite this success , the players ' union is the major force behind Sen. Metzenbaum 's push for antitrust legislation .
Because a long-standing provision of the antitrust laws precludes their application to any labor union , Sen. Metzenbaum 's bill would not threaten the players ' continued collective action .
The bill , however , would give the union the option of filing an antitrust challenge to the owners ' plan to implement a salary cap , which would limit each team 's payroll .
Fortunately for the owners , Senate Majority Leader -LRB- and , reportedly , soon-to-be baseball commissioner -RRB- George Mitchell is not about to let the legislation pass .
Although Sen. Mitchell normally could be counted on to support a fellow Democrat 's effort to burden the economy with a little more regulation , the prospect of actually having to cope with his colleagues ' handiwork after he leaves the Senate seems to have brought out the deregulator in Sen. Mitchell , at least as regards the nation 's pastime .
Politics aside , the antitrust laws do not offer a good means of resolving the baseball strike .
Sensibly applied in the right circumstances , the antitrust laws generally do a good job of preventing private restraints of market output that harms consumers .
Giving the players ' union an antitrust bat to bludgeon the owners , however , is unlikely to increase output or benefit fans .
The union and the owners are what economists call bilateral monopolists .
To produce baseball , both players and management are indispensable .
However , because the players are unionized and because the owners control a sports league for which no successful competitor has come along in 90 years , each has no choice but to deal with the other .
The financial dispute at the heart of the strike concerns how the players and owners are going to divide up the `` rents ' -LRB- the economists ' name for profits -RRB- generated by baseball .
What impact , if any , the ultimate division of rents will have on the output of baseball is difficult to predict , and the antitrust laws are simply incapable of determining the socially optimal division .
That is not to say , however , that there is nothing at stake for fans other than a quick end to the strike .
Over the past several years , the disparity in the payrolls of the 28 major league teams has grown .
Currently , the largest payroll , which belongs to the Yankees at $ 45 million , is more than three times larger than the smallest , the $ 14 million paid by the San Diego Padres .
It is true that in any given year a team 's relative performance is not necessarily dictated by its payroll .
This year , while the Yankees lead the American League , the Montreal Expos with a payroll of only $ 19 million lead the National League .
Nevertheless , over the long run such disparity in payrolls , combined with player free-agency , will almost certainly translate into a lack of parity on the field .
In order for any sports league to thrive , fans must expect that the league generally will present roughly even contests .
If there is insufficient parity in a league , then the perennial cellar dwellers will be unable to attract fans and even the fans of the dominant teams will lose interest in the sport .
Though the owners seem to be arguing that a salary cap is necessary to protect themselves from their own profligacy , the truth is that something like a salary cap , which both the National Football League and the National Basketball Association have adopted , will be necessary if parity in baseball is to be preserved .
Interjecting antitrust into the process will only complicate the effort to find an acceptable mechanism to ensure parity among the major league teams .
The antitrust courts historically have not proven to be very astute at understanding the need for rules like salary caps that are necessary to ensure the efficient operation of sports leagues .
A law that allows the players ' union to bring an antitrust challenge against the owners will only make a few lawyers rich and prolong the strike .
The antitrust laws will not help the players and the owners to recognize their mutual self-interest in curing what ails baseball .
Only by working together will the owners and players be able to find a solution that preserves parity and ensures that the appeal of baseball to the fans will grow .
Mr. Rule , a Washington attorney , served as assistant attorney general in charge of antitrust from 1986 to 1989 .
NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group said it lowered its ratings of Aetna Life & Casualty Co. and several units based on `` continued weak earnings .
'' Among the ratings affected are senior debt to single-A-plus from double-A-minus and commercial paper to single-A-1 from single-A-1-plus .
The downgrade affects about $ 1.2 billion of long-term debt .
S&P also lowered the claims-paying-ability ratings of Aetna Life Insurance & Annuity Co. , or Aliac , to double-A from triple-A , and Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. .
Group to single-A-plus from double-A-minus .
Also affected is S&P 's claims-paying-ability rating of Aetna Life Insurance Co. of America , to single-A-plus from double-A-minus .
S&P said the rating action reflects `` continued weak earnings through the first half of 1994 , which have fallen well below S&P 's expectations .
'' The Hartford , Conn. , insurance concern said it strongly disagrees with the downgrades at Aliac and Aetna Casualty & Surety .
`` We do not believe that S&P has a reasonable basis for downgrading Aliac , '' said Chairman Ronald E. Compton .
`` This action does not recognize Aliac 's strong earnings track record , solid market position and excellent asset quality .
'' In response to S&P 's property-casualty downgrades , Mr. Compton said , `` S&P has not adequately taken into account the level of our property-casualty reserves or our actions to reduce expenses and improve our underwriting .
'' DETROIT -- Chrysler Corp. described as a `` complete fabrication '' a report linking its Beijing Jeep Corp. joint venture in China with a Chinese company that allegedly uses forced labor .
Chrysler said Beijing Jeep does n't use any products produced by New Face Vehicle Refit Factory , a company that the report said uses prison labor .
The reports of a link between Chrysler and alleged prison labor at New Face were made in the Eastern Express , a relatively new Hong Kong newspaper .
Eastern Express reported that New Face has `` strong production ties with '' Beijing Autoworks Industrial Corp. .
Chrysler said Beijing Autoworks Industrial is a sister company of its joint-venture partner , Beijing Auto Works .
Increasingly , Westerners doing business in China are finding themselves contending with Chinese subcontractors or units of Chinese joint-venture partners alleged to have committed human-rights violations .
Chrysler came under fire recently from human-rights groups when an employee at Beijing Jeep , who said he was jailed by Chinese authorities for practicing Christianity , was suspended .

ATLANTA -- When Larry Dean built the largest , splashiest estate in town , he said he wanted to `` glorify the gifts of God .
'' What God makes of a Moroccan theater , 24-karat-gold sinks , 15 bedrooms and an 18-hole golf course remains unclear .
What is apparent is that Mr. Dean 's $ 40 million project has become less of a divine dream house than his own high-priced purgatory .
He ca n't seem to get rid of it .
`` I 'm sort of a prisoner here , '' says Mr. Dean , standing in the Peacock Room of his giant pink mansion , overlooking his outdoor amphitheater , tennis courts and gardens .
Stretching along the banks of the Chattahoochee River , among the magnolias , dogwoods and freshly built mansions of Atlanta 's rich and famous , Dean Gardens stands as one of the area 's boldest monuments to new wealth .
The 32,000-square-foot , tropical neoclassic mansion , as Mr. Dean describes it , has bathrooms built like Egyptian tombs , a Hawaiian-art gallery , a 1950s-style dance hall , French Empire furniture , 13 fireplaces , an `` Alice in Wonderland '' master bedroom and a 24-seat dining room complete with a wall-sized aquarium called the Predator Tank .
The 60-acre grounds boast grass tennis courts , a chapel , an Italian pavilion , 25 `` water features '' and a conservatory .
And that is just in the backyard .
The estate has cost Mr. Dean more than $ 30 million to date , and upkeep and taxes run more than $ 100,000 a month .
`` I just do n't like living here any more , '' Mr. Dean says ; indeed , he is so sick of the sumptuous mansion that he lives alone in an apartment above the garage .
Clearly , Dean Gardens was n't supposed to turn out this way .
Mr. Dean , a native Atlantan and admitted `` redneck at heart , '' made his fortune launching a software company called Stockholder Systems Inc. , which later was sold to Nynex Corp. for $ 68 million .
He enjoys telling his story , that he grew up `` a poor boy in a four-room house with no plumbing '' and , through hard work and devotion to God , made something of himself .
By the age of 45 , Mr. Dean decided it was time to build his legacy .
After visiting Bellingrath Gardens in Mobile , Ala. , and the Biltmore Estate in Asheville , N.C. -- showcase estates in the South -- Mr. Dean and his wife , Lynda , conceived of Dean Gardens .
Their intent was to establish a family compound where the Deans could watch their children and grandchildren grow up and `` capitalize on the beauty of the gardens for charitable purposes while we were living there .
'' After Mr. and Mrs. Dean 's deaths , the house and gardens were supposed to be donated to the Dean Gardens charitable foundation .
This modest dream of paradise grew .
Construction began in 1988 .
Designed by Mr. Dean 's 21-year-old son , the house ballooned to three times its original estimated cost , as did the gardens .
Hordes of artists and craftsmen swarmed over everything , painting ceilings , designing floors , creating stained-glass windows and archways .
A former Disney artist carved 280 gold medallions for the rotunda .
A North Carolina sculptor constructed the master bed in the shape of an iris , painting it iridescent pink and aqua .
She applied 14 layers of special automotive paint , the kind used on Corvettes , `` because it gives depth and glow .
'' The gardens grew to fill the site , stocked with Italian sculptures , spray fountains , a par-72 golf course , lagoons , imported boulders , Japanese maples , wisteria trestles , an Asian teahouse and more than 500,000 flowers .
`` If I knew what it was going to cost , I would never have built it , '' Mr. Dean says now of the four-year undertaking .
But he did .
And for about a year and a half , he says , the Deans lived in their paradise as a happy family .
Mr. Dean declines to discuss details of such a personal matter , but a separation ensued , and Mrs. Dean and their four children left Dean Gardens .
Around the same time , Mr. Dean bowed out of Stockholder Systems , citing the need to `` fulfill some of my more personal goals .
'' Soon , the bills on the house started rolling in , and it became apparent that Mr. Dean 's dream exceeded his checkbook .
So last summer , he put his estate on the market .
Mr. Dean is trying just about everything to unload Dean Gardens , pitching it to Saudi royalty , Southern corporations and religious groups .
Yet with its $ 40 million price tag , Dean Gardens has had no takers .
`` It 's a limited market , '' Mr. Dean acknowledges .
`` I was just figuring the other day , I 'd make out pretty good if I just donated it , '' he says .
`` It saves me $ 1.5 million a year right off the bat in bills .
'' Others are more optimistic .
`` There are lots of people like Larry Dean who had to abandon their dreams , '' says Robin Leach , host of the syndicated television program `` Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous , '' which profiled the home .
`` But he 's got a real gem , and someone will buy it .
'' Recently , Atlanta buzzed with the rumor that reclusive pop-star Michael Jackson and his new bride , Lisa Marie Presley , were interested .
Mr. Dean 's neighbors , who have complained continually about Mr. Dean 's `` ego monument , '' are a bit leery of the Jackson scenario .
`` I think Mr. Jackson would be a fine neighbor , '' says Alan Hamby , who lives in the nearby Thorn Hill estates .
`` But he ca n't be bringing in all his llamas , chimps and Ferris wheels without a zoning change .
'' Zoning seems to be a touchy subject in the neighborhood .
At one point , Mr. Dean applied for a zoning change with the local planning commission , aiming to convert the house into a museum and event center .
Busloads of tourists , he figured , would pay to tee off on his golf course , romp through his house , listen to concerts at his amphitheater and maybe even get married in his chapel .
Or , he could turn it into an exclusive bed and breakfast , `` where high-level executives and stars could come and relax without being bothered by the public .
'' Mr. Dean 's neighbors , however , did n't buy it .
They persuaded the commission to turn down the zoning request , arguing their peaceful surroundings would be destroyed by traffic , noise and rap concerts .
`` We did n't want another Hollywood or Larrywood or whatever you want to call it around here , '' says Mr. Hamby .
So now Mr. Dean is back to the sale plan .
He says he has had a few contracts , but ultimately none were signed by Michael Jackson or anyone else .
He is looking into leasing - `` Like for Coke , to do corporate events for a year '' - and is banking on the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta to attract interest .
An auction is even possible .
But how long can Mr. Dean ride out the payments ?
`` Indefinitely , '' he says , although associates say he is `` very anxious .
'' If he sells the house , Mr. Dean says he plans to move to Florida for a year to chart a new course .
Meanwhile , he says his life is simple , and he rarely uses the golf course , entertainment center or other amenities .
`` I like cutting grass , and there 's sure a lot of grass to cut , '' he says .
`` Maybe there 's a purpose to all of this that I just do n't see .
But right now , I 'd say this was a big mistake .

HOUSTON -- American General Corp. , afraid Unitrin Inc. would complete its stock buyback before a judge could rule on it , asked for a temporary restraining order to block the repurchase .
American General , which has made a hostile bid to buy Unitrin for $ 50.375 a share , or $ 2.6 billion , filed suit on Friday in Delaware Chancery Court seeking a preliminary injunction .
Since the suit was filed , however , Unitrin has refused to give assurance that the buyback wo n't be completed before the injunction request is heard , said a spokesman for American General , an insurance company .
The request for the restraining order could be heard today .
American General wants to stop the buyback because it would increase the stake held by Unitrin 's directors to 28 % from 23 % , giving them the power to block an acquisition .
Unitrin 's bylaws call for 75 % shareholder approval of a sale .
Heavy trading in Unitrin yesterday indicated that the Chicago insurer was proceeding with the buyback .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading , Unitrin rose 56.25 cents a share to close at $ 51.063 .
A Unitrin spokesman had no comment on the latest filing or on the progress of the 10-million-share buyback .
BOSTON -- Ground Round Restaurants Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to be acquired for $ 100 million , or $ 9 a share in cash , by a newly formed investment concern that includes members of its senior management .
The restaurant concern said the proposed purchase would have a total value of about $ 160 million , including the buyer 's assumption of $ 5 million of capital leases and refinancing of about $ 52 million of debt .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday , Ground Round rose 31 % to set a 52-week high , closing at $ 8.375 a share , up $ 2 .
The buyer is a new company to be formed by institutional investors led by 399 Ventures Inc. , a Citicorp affiliate , Ground Round said .
Michael P. O'Donnell , Ground Round 's chairman , president and chief executive officer , and other Ground Round senior managers would be among the investors in the new company .
Mr. O'Donnell would remain CEO .
Ground Round said the purchase is subject to receipt of financing and approval by holders of two-thirds of its common shares outstanding .
The company added that shareholders owning about 40 % of its stock agreed to vote in favor of the purchase .
The concern said Smith Barney Inc. acted as its financial adviser in connection with the proposed purchase .
Boston-based Ground Round operates 163 restaurants , and franchises an additional 43 restaurants in the Northeast , mid-Atlantic and Midwest .
In February , the company withdrew a proposed public offering of $ 35 million of convertible debentures , citing a drop in its share price .
In recent months , the company has reported same-store sales growth of 2 % to 3 % , but its stock price has remained at about $ 6 a share after trading as high as $ 8 a share in January .
A Ground Round spokeswoman said the board decided to sell the concern because it felt the stock was undervalued .
In the third quarter ended July 3 , Ground Round earned $ 1.6 million , or 14 cents a share , up about 14 % from $ 1.4 million , or 12 cents a share , a year earlier .
Revenue rose about 9 % to $ 60.7 million from $ 55.8 million .
Janet Dresden , 50 pounds overweight , tried Weight Watchers , the Diet Center , the Stillman Diet , the Atkins Diet , raw-juice fasts , an `` applied kinesiologist 's '' high-fat diet and nearly every other diet she ever heard of .
Nothing worked .
She would lose 20 or 30 pounds and gain them right back .
Her workplace did n't make dieting easier : Janet Dresden 's Incredible Edibles , a caterer in Stamford , Conn. `` We make the most phenomenal desserts , '' she sighs .
`` If you eat five cookies when you come in , then two hours later you have five more , then you repeat that four or five times during the day ... do you know what that can do to a body ?
Forget it !
'' This year a doctor told Ms. Dresden about a new approach .
He told her that obesity is n't a failure of will or behavior but a chronic medical condition , just like diabetes or hypertension .
Its origins lie in the signals of the brain , he said , which misfire with too many messages urging overeaters to crave food .
The treatment : an antidepressant-like drug that would silence the rogue messages .
This new view is sweeping through medical circles , raising dizzying questions about biology 's sway over the mind .
It is also setting off a high-stakes race for the first new obesity drug in 20 years .
One leading contender is a potent chemical cousin of Prozac , developed by a controversial husband-and-wife team of neuroscientists who believe overeaters are self-medicating to chase away the blues .
Another is Prozac itself , repackaged with a higher dose and a new name : Lovan .
Their makers are salivating over a vast market : This week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting that obesity is surging and more than 30 % of American adults are now 20 % or more overweight .
Both drug applications are now before the Food and Drug Administration , where officials for years have shown a decided disfavor toward obesity drugs .
Skeptics contend there is n't yet convincing evidence that long-term use of obesity drugs is safe and keeps weight off year after year .
But there are signs of a shift at the agency .
`` Obesity used to be viewed as a lack of willpower in a patient ... It was not viewed as a medical problem .
Today I think it is , '' says Douglas Greene , a University of Michigan endocrinologist who heads an FDA committee of outside experts that studies new obesity drugs .
He wo n't comment on specific drug applications , but says : `` There are many that are under development , and our hope is that we would be able to get such agents to add to our armamentarium .
'' Doctors are already treating thousands of patients according to the new neuroscientific approach , using older drugs .
As their ranks swell , they pose a serious threat to the $ 2 billion industry that sells weight-loss programs based on using diet and exercise to shed pounds .
Dieters generally gain back most of their lost weight within three to five years .
More broadly , the view is igniting an emotional debate about drugs and human behavior .
Wide use of Prozac has already raised questions about whether moods and personalities might be merely concoctions of brain chemicals , more readily changed by medicine than by insight or will .
Is eating behavior just another chemical concoction ?
Janet Dresden certainly thinks so .
At 50 , she says she has spent half her life consumed by obsessions about food .
`` I was always thinking about what I would eat for my next meal , where I was going to eat it , how I was going to prepare it , even what I was going to eat next week .
Food dominated my thoughts .
'' She kept her clothes in four separate closets -- thin , just getting heavy , moderately heavy , and fat -- and shuttled despondently from closet to closet as her weight bounced between 120 and 175 pounds too many times to count .
But everything changed for Ms. Dresden when she paid a visit to a New York internist named Ronald Ruden in March .
He told her to forget everything she knew about dieting .
The real source of her weight problem , he said , was a shortage of serotonin , a powerful brain chemical that affects mood , satiety and obsessive behavior .
Dr. Ruden was one of legions of physicians who had been electrified by a recent study of overweight residents of upstate New York .
Its author , a University of Rochester clinical pharmacologist named Michael Weintraub , was convinced it was time to re-examine old-fashioned attitudes about using pills to lose weight .
Most doctors had always considered diet pills mildly sleazy , dispensed by faddists .
The only pills around were 20-year-old amphetamine look-alikes , some with serious potential for abuse .
Above all , doctors felt , they did n't work : As soon as most patients stopped taking the pills , they promptly gained back all the weight they had lost .
So doctors generally urged their overweight patients to go on diets and get more exercise .
Dr. Weintraub thought too many doctors had judgmental views of obese people as weak-willed and self-indulgent .
He also thought they were missing the point about relapses .
If obesity is a chronic condition , should n't it need chronic treatment ?
Nobody would ever say a blood-pressure drug did n't work if a patient 's blood-pressure went back up when he stopped taking it .
To test his theory , Dr. Weintraub designed the first trial ever of chronic medication for obesity , sponsored by the U.S. government 's National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute .
Over four years in the late 1980s , he gave 121 subjects small doses of two of the disdained old diet pills .
One was a fairly crude Fisons PLC appetite suppressant called Ionamin .
The other , A.H. Robins Co. 's Pondimin , had a singular action not found in most diet drugs : It raised serotonin levels .
He also gave a control group placebos , and put all his subjects on a regimen of exercise and healthy diet .
The results : The pill-takers lost an average of 16 % of their weight in eight months , and kept most of it off for three years .
The placebo group lost only 5 % -- and then , in an unusual twist , were put on the drugs themselves and matched the other group 's loss .
The study reported no problems with drug abuse and few serious side effects .
Critics called Dr. Weintraub 's sample too small to be significant .
But the study set off a tidal wave when he published it in the May 1992 issue of the journal Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics .
Thousands of doctors besieged Dr. Weintraub for copies .
Robins -LRB- now a unit of American Home Products Corp. -RRB- was overwhelmed with double its usual orders for an outdated drug it barely even marketed , and hastily added an extra shift at its Pondimin factory .
Today , Pondimin prescriptions are seven times their rate before the study , and an estimated 25,000 patients have gone on variations of the Weintraub regimen -- including Ms. Dresden .
At first , she saw astounding results .
`` For the first time in my life I felt like a normal person , '' she says .
Her obsessions about food seemed to shut off like a switch , even at work .
`` I was surrounded by that fabulous food , but I just admired it .
It was wonderful , I did n't have to eat everything in sight .
'' In two months she had lost 35 pounds .
Inspired by stories like this , the drug industry is placing some big bets that the market for obesity pills is ready to explode .
The story of the two biggest gambles starts at the same place : the Massachusetts Institute of Technology labs of Richard and Judith Wurtman .
Long before the Weintraub study , the Wurtmans were causing a stir with some mind-bending assertions about food and the brain .
In the 1970s , Richard Wurtman , a prominent brain researcher , found that eating carbohydrates set off a startling chain reaction .
Everyone already knew the first two steps : The body converts starch to sugar ; the sugar spurs the pancreas to release insulin .
Dr. Wurtman followed the trail two steps farther .
He discovered that insulin raises brain levels of an amino acid called tryptophan .
Tryptophan , in turn , is a raw ingredient in the production of serotonin .
Meanwhile , scientists were also finding that serotonin played a crucial role in regulating mood .
Higher levels of serotonin seemed to create the feeling of well-being .
Put it all together , and it looked as if munching on a sandwich could give a person a strong chemical jolt of happiness .
Dr. Wurtman 's wife , Judith , a research nutritionist , set about investigating that hypothesis .
In a pioneering study , her team found that obese people 's moods soared after they gobbled up high-carbohydrate biscuits .
She also found that premenstrual women and smokers trying to quit tended to eat more carbohydrates -- and saw their moods lift afterward .
Her conclusion : Overeaters -- like some drinkers and drug users -- were groping for a way to lift their depressed moods .
The Wurtmans experimented with serotonin drugs and found they did indeed appear to help overeaters cut down on snacking and lose weight .
One seemed particularly promising , a diet drug called dexfenfluramine , made by the French pharmaceutical firm Les Laboratoires Servier .
It was precisely half the molecule of Pondimin , the drug that worked so well in the Weintraub study .
In fact , the Wurtmans thought it was the half responsible for all of Pondimin 's powers , without the half that caused its occasional side effects : dry mouth , diarrhea , unsteadiness and memory problems .
In 1982 , the Wurtmans quietly grabbed a U.S. patent for the use of dexfenfluramine to treat overeating .
Six years later they co-founded a company , Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. , to commercialize the drug .
The buzz on Wall Street about `` dex '' made Interneuron a sexy stock when it went public in 1990 , turning the Wurtmans into paper millionaires .
This January the company filed its FDA application to market the drug .
The agency already had an application for a rival obesity drug , thanks in part to the Wurtmans .
In the 1980s , researchers at Eli Lilly & Co. had consulted Richard Wurtman about an unexpected side effect of a serotonin drug they were studying as an antidepressant : Patients were shedding pounds without even dieting .
It made perfect sense to Dr. Wurtman , who briefed Lilly about his research .
The drug was Prozac , and in 1988 Lilly applied for FDA approval to market it for obesity .
Today Lilly officials say they do n't strictly agree with the Wurtman thesis that overeaters are self-medicating an underlying depression .
Lilly says Prozac helps obese patients for a different reason : Serotonin controls the brain 's `` satiety center '' -- sending messages that the body is hungry or full .
The Prozac application has languished at the FDA ever since .
This year regulators gave Prozac a preliminary green light as a treatment for bulimia , a narrower disorder of binge eating .
But many in the drug industry concluded that the FDA simply did n't accept the notion that obesity was a disease treatable with medicine .
Recently , however , the agency quietly took a significant step .
It moved the two obesity drugs out of its psychopharmacology branch and into a new area whose officials appear far more inclined to consider them seriously : the endocrine and metabolic branch .
Dr. Greene of the FDA advisory committee sees a clear place for medicine in obesity treatment and expects his panel to review one or both applications later this year .
A green light from the panel would make approval all but certain .
The FDA also has a new top official who is helping thaw the freeze on obesity drugs : Michael Weintraub .
Two years ago , he became director of the agency 's office of over-the-counter drug evaluation .
The post gives him no formal responsibility for prescription drugs , but FDA officials say he is playing an influential role in reviewing the obesity applications .
Still , approval is far from certain .
This year a Johns Hopkins University study linked dexfenfluramine to toxicity in monkeys ' brains .
Regulators will also have to weigh the enormous risks of unleashing potent new medicines onto a nation of desperate dieters .
About a third of women and a quarter of men in the U.S. are currently trying to lose weight , according to the National Institutes of Health .
Both Lilly and Interneuron say their drugs are intended for serious medical cases of obesity , typically patients more than 30 % over their ideal weight .
Both also say the drugs should only be used alongside strict programs of exercise and diet .
But skeptics believe the drugs would inevitably catch fire with weight watchers who merely want to shed a few pounds for the beach .
They point to Prozac 's phenomenal history as a depression treatment : Released only for grave clinical cases , it has inspired fervent testimonials from healthy patients with milder personality complaints .
`` Physicians just do n't seem to know how to say no to patients ' requests for powerful drugs -- that 's the lesson of Prozac , '' says David Rothman , a Columbia University professor of social medicine .
`` Do we really want to start suggesting that fluctuation in weight , like fluctuation in mood , becomes the occasion for taking major-league drugs ?
'' Others lament that new obesity drugs would make it too easy for overweight Americans to abandon all hope of eating a healthy diet .
`` You 're mopping around the floor where the sink is overflowing , without turning off the faucet , '' says Dean Ornish , a California doctor leading a crusade to treat heart disease through diet and lifestyle change .
He disputes the premise that a serotonin imbalance is the root cause of obesity , calling it merely another symptom of unhealthy eating and stress .
And he says his clinical work suggests that a diet with only 10 % of calories from fat -- far lower than most other diet plans -- is every bit as effective as any drug in losing weight and keeping it off .
Furthermore , the new drugs are expensive -- $ 600 to $ 1,400 for a year 's supply of Prozac -- and sometimes have serious side effects -- as Ms. Dresden found out .
Six weeks after going on Pondimin and Ionamin , she found herself walking into rooms and forgetting why she was there .
One day in her car , she suddenly could n't remember where she was driving and pulled over to the side of the road in a panic .
Desperate to ignore any hint of bad news about her new drugs , she delayed telling Dr. Ruden .
But finally she did , and he quickly took her off the drugs .
Crushed , she is now bracing herself for the return of her old habits , and her old weight .
`` These pills are a godsend , '' she says wistfully .
`` I truly would have been on them for the rest of my life .
'' RADCLIFF , Ky. -- The directions were to hang a right on Freedom Way , just before the Wal-Mart .
Go a few blocks and , at the end of the street , I 'd find the community center where the diversity-training workshop would be held .
It does n't take a Proust to see the symbolism : Diversity is the culmination of a dead-end street called Freedom .
With such portentous thoughts buzzing in my head , the actual diversity seminar was somewhat of a shock .
I was prepared for a communist-style re-education camp , or at least a politically correct blow-up full of wailing about `` latent '' racism .
Instead I got a feel-good , do n't - offend-anybody session on helping customers of all backgrounds .
There was no finger-pointing , no admissions from whites that they were racists , no wailing about the evil power structure .
Dale Carnegie would have felt right at home .
Welcome to Diversity Lite .
What started as a radical assault on the bastions of privilege has turned into a strange-tasting gumbo made up of management-speak on how to `` grow '' your business and academic jargon about how to root out `` oppression .
'' It still may not make much sense , but this version of diversity is palatable even in small-town Kentucky .
That 's important for the diversity industry , which is looking for new clients as it increases market penetration .
The industry has seen spectacular growth since 1987 , spurred , ironically , by a report from the conservative Hudson Institute predicting huge changes in the ethnicity of the workforce by the year 2000 .
Nobody knows how many consultants are out there , but the number certainly runs into the thousands .
Their services have been used by a who 's who of blue-chip companies , including Xerox , IBM and Coca-Cola .
Diversity trainers have backgrounds in civil rights , human resources , psychology , social work -- just about anything .
The top trainers , such as Elsie Cross and R. Roosevelt Thomas , charge around $ 10,000 a day .
Many of them only take multimillion-dollar , multiyear contracts .
Nonprofits like the Anti-Defamation League and the National Conference -LRB- nee the National Conference of Christians and Jews -RRB- are also cashing in .
The National Conference 's big break came when it won a contract to re-educate Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott and her organization .
Many of its 62 field offices are now involved in diversity training .
The seminar I recently attended was run by the Louisville branch -- one of many it puts on for managers of Kentucky 's largest bank , Liberty National .
Each half-day seminar costs around $ 750 -- a bargain !
Why do businesses line up to pay these fees ?
`` It 's become the trendy thing to do , '' says Tammy Bormann , who runs diversity programs for the National Conference .
`` I do n't think a lot of companies take it very seriously .
'' Jim McDonnell , president and CEO of Liberty National 's central Kentucky operations , insists that he does take it seriously .
It 's good for business , he says , because `` if we treat the general public well , our business will do well .
'' This , despite no evidence that diversity training has any effect on the bottom line , as Ms. Bormann is the first to admit .
But there 's a more immediate reason why Mr. McDonnell , whose good ol' boy manner belies his business sense , is gung-ho for diversity .
`` We 're getting pressure from the regulators to do it , '' he says .
Banks have been whipsawed by charges of red-lining and discrimination in lending .
Liberty National faces a regulatory exam next month and Mr. McDonnell will have to give the feds details on the diversity training -- or else `` they 'll come down on us real hard , '' he says .
The courts are also putting the heat on many businesses to engage in what Frederick Lynch , a Claremont McKenna professor , calls `` defensive diversity .
'' Some companies , he says , hope that diversity training will shield them from lawsuits .
Unfortunately that strategy backfired for Lucky Stores -- the supermarket chain lost a sex discrimination lawsuit after statements made in a seminar were used by the plaintiffs .
But setbacks in the courtoom are a relatively minor problem for the diversity industry compared to white male backlash -- the serpent lurking in its Garden of Eden .
`` There are a large number of horror stories circulating among people who do this work about trainers who do white male bashing , '' says Harris Sussman , a Cambridge , Mass.-based trainer -LRB- and , he quickly adds , a white male -RRB- .
In one case , Campus magazine reports , a University of Cincinnati trainer told a white male in the audience that his father 's death `` removed one more racist influence '' from his life .
Many of the National Conference 's trainers take a less confrontational , more expansive view of diversity , arguing that it does n't just cover gender and race but also religion , age , sexual orientation and a host of other factors .
That comes in handy in Radcliff , where the audience for this diversity seminar is all white .
Pat Gleich , a former social worker turned diversity trainer , assures the 25 bank employees that diversity is n't only skin deep .
She insists there 's also diversity among cultures , defined as `` people who share similar experiences and similar backgrounds .
'' Ms. Gleich asks the seminar participants to break up into small groups to discuss their cultural diversity .
Afterward , she says , `` You can see how complex we are as individuals .
It 's hard to take a label and put it on us ... Yet we do that when we stereotype others .
'' Ms. Gleich then launches into a short lecture on cultural differences , explaining , for instance , that in Asian cultures eye contact is avoided yet in the U.S. it 's seen as a mark of trustworthiness .
The stress is on understanding those who behave and look differently -- even residents of big-city Louisville a few miles down the road .
Sounds all right -- so far .
Then the seminar takes a turn into mild politically correct land .
Ms. Gleich condemns all `` isms '' -- sexism , ageism , racism , classism , even ableism -- but she adds that all prejudice is n't equal .
Only when it 's combined with power does it bring about `` oppression '' -- a nice way of blaming all ills on the alleged white male power structure .
Ms. Gleich lists four varieties of oppression .
Political and physical , she concedes , are rare in the U.S. .
But she claims economic and psychological oppression are rampant .
As an example of the former , she cites the fact that airports are predominantly built in poorer areas ; as an example of the latter , she cites women who think they ca n't succeed unless they act like men .
She then puts on a hidden-camera report from ABC 's PrimeTime Live that shows a presentable-looking black man getting shoddier treatment from some sales clerks than a white colleague .
`` It 's very surprising , '' says one white man in the audience .
`` I did n't think things like that happened anymore .
I guess that 's why we 're here .
'' -LRB- Another audience member points out that ABC snipped together the most damning episodes from weeks of taping , perhaps giving a distorted view .
-RRB- Ms. Gleich asks if audience members have experienced oppression first hand .
Even in this middle class audience , plenty have -- or think they have .
Several of the women complain about condescending treatment from car salesmen and auto mechanics .
`` You get so angry , '' says one well-dressed , middle-aged woman .
The workshop wraps up with the audience breaking up into small groups .
Each group is given a different case-study -- say , a Japanese man and woman or two white males -- and asked to write down stereotypes about them .
Ms. Gleich ends with an exhortation : `` Even I catch myself conjuring up stereotypes .
I have to remind myself I 'm dealing with a person , not a group .
'' Much of this sounds sensible , but lurking not so far beneath the surface are more loony elements .
At the start of the seminar Ms. Gleich distributes a packet for everyone to read .
Among its documents are two pages on the `` invisibility of white privilege '' from Peggy McIntosh , a radical feminist at Wellesley College .
Among the examples : `` I can talk with my mouth full and not have people put this down to my color '' and `` I can chose blemish cover or bandages in ` flesh ' color and have them more or less match my skin .

Random House Inc. said it invested in an undisclosed ownership stake in Knowledge Adventure Inc. , a California-based multimedia concern , as part of a pact under which the companies will jointly produce and market multimedia titles .
Both companies are closely held .
Random House , based in New York , is a unit of Advance Publications Inc. .
The investment and stake acquired were n't disclosed .
Random House , through its `` Living Books '' joint venture with Broderbund Software Inc. , already has a substantial interest in multimedia publishing .
Under the agreement with Knowledge Adventure , the two companies will put together a multimedia version of a children 's encyclopedia now published in book form by Random House .
Other titles are expected but the agreement does n't specify how many , a Knowledge Adventure spokesman said .
Other investors in Knowledge Adventure , La Crescenta , Calif. , include Steven Spielberg , who in June announced plans to collaborate on multimedia projects .
Toll Brothers Inc. said brisk home sales helped push the home builder 's net income up 26 % in its fiscal third quarter .
For the three months ended July 31 , net income was $ 8 million , or 24 cents a share , up from $ 6.3 million , or 19 cents a share , a year earlier .
Revenue was $ 120.1 million , up 17 % from $ 102.4 million a year earlier .
The Huntingdon Valley , Pa. , company said although it is `` on course '' for record revenue and earnings for its fiscal year , it is concerned `` with the sluggishness reported in many housing markets and the slowing of traffic '' in its communities in the last quarter .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , the company 's stock closed at $ 11.625 , up 50 cents , or 4.5 % .
For the nine months , net income was $ 20.8 million , or 62 cents a share , up 29 % from $ 16.2 million , or 49 cents a share , last year .
The year-earlier results included a benefit of $ 1.3 million , or four cents a share , for income-tax changes .

Reviving a transaction once thought dead , Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. 's board reaffirmed its approval of the video-rental and music chain 's proposed takeover by Viacom Inc. , and voted unanimously to put the transaction before a shareholder vote .
In addition , Blockbuster said its investment banker , Merrill Lynch & Co. , issued a favorable fairness opinion on the transaction , whereby Viacom acquires Blockbuster for stock .
`` We never lost confidence in the proposed merger , '' said Steven Berrard , president of Blockbuster .
With the board 's approval , industry analysts said they now expect shareholders of the Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , company to back the accord .
The move by the Blockbuster board represents the latest step in a remarkable turnaround in the fortunes of the Blockbuster-Viacom transaction .
In January , New York-based Viacom agreed to buy Blockbuster for a package of securities then valued at $ 8.4 billion , but with a subsequent plunge in Viacom 's stock price , the value of the transaction is currently about $ 7.65 billion .
That drop in the value of Viacom 's stock appeared to place the takeover in jeopardy throughout most of this year .
Before the Blockbuster acquisition was announced , Viacom Class B shares traded at $ 42.75 each and Blockbuster stock traded at $ 29.875 .
Once the agreement was struck , however , Viacom 's shares began to slide , trading as low as $ 21.75 in April .
That meant that Blockbuster shareholders would have received far less in the transaction than what their stock would be valued at if the acquisition collapsed .
In the past month , however , Viacom 's stock has rallied , for the first time giving Blockbuster shareholders a premium -- albeit a small one -- over the current market price of their own shares .
In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Viacom Class B shares closed at $ 35.25 , down 25 cents .
Blockbuster closed at $ 27.875 , up 62.5 cents , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
If the transaction were completed now , Blockbuster holders would get about $ 29 a share .
In late May , Wayne Huizenga , Blockbuster 's chairman and chief executive officer -- with a nod toward Viacom 's weak share price -- cautioned that `` there could be no assurance '' that the company 's board would be able to recommend the transaction .
Yesterday , he said the union would `` result in significant value for our shareholders .
'' The process , he acknowledged , has been a `` long and sometimes bumpy road .
'' Viacom , an entertainment and publishing giant , is eager to get Blockbuster 's enormous cash flow to help pay the debt created by Viacom 's recent purchase of Paramount Communications Inc. .
If Blockbuster shareholders approve the takeover , in a vote scheduled for Sept. 29 , the resulting company would be a sprawling entertainment concern , with music and video stores , theme parks , movie studios and cable-television networks such as MTV , VH-1 and Nickelodeon .
Hailing the reborn agreement as the forerunner of `` a global media powerhouse , '' Viacom immediately called a special meeting of its shareholders , also for Sept. 29 , to vote on the proposed takeover .
In a statement , Viacom added that the `` combination of Viacom , Paramount and now Blockbuster creates an unmatched portfolio of global entertainment and publishing assets .
'' In February , J.P. Morgan estimated the three companies combined would boast 1994 revenue of $ 10.7 billion , and cash flow -- or earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization -- of $ 1.9 billion .
Still , the outcome of the transaction still hinges on Viacom 's stock price remaining firm .
But people close to Viacom expressed confidence that the share price will hold up .
Investors `` are beginning to believe we know what we are doing , '' one Viacom insider deadpanned .
Blockbuster 's about-face on the proposal surprised analysts and shareholders , though analysts believe the acquisition will be approved .
Only about 27 % of the shares held by noninsiders would have to be voted in favor of the accord , as an additional 23 % is held by company officials already committed to the plan .
In addition , arbitragers -- stock traders who take bets on takeover stocks -- own an unknown but perhaps significant amount of Blockbuster shares and have indicated they will support the pact .
Still , some shareholders were upset by yesterday 's announcement .
`` I do n't have one person in my group who would vote for the deal , '' said Richard Christoph , a large Blockbuster shareholder in Lake Forest , Ill. `` It might turn out OK over the long pull , but right now it is n't good .
'' Craig Bibb , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York , called yesterday 's decision by Blockbustser `` disappointing '' because in January , Blockbuster shareholders would have received about $ 31.50 for their shares .
`` And Blockbuster is more than 20 % larger now , '' he added .
Meanwhile , Viacom and Tele-Communications Inc. are haggling down to the wire to settle a legal clash with an accord that would either combine businesses of both or result in the sale of billions of dollars of Viacom assets to TCI , according to people close to the situation .
In a textbook case of brinkmanship , these people say , both sides are declaring that they are down to their final offers and do n't intend to budge further .
The talks have been dragging on for months and have hit numerous snags , mainly over price .
Both companies declined to comment .
The negotiations have been especially difficult in large part because the two companies are led by two of the industry 's most powerful and stubborn negotiators -- Viacom 's chairman and majority owner , Sumner Redstone , and TCI 's chief executive , John Malone .
They have negotiated face-to-face , by phone , through intermediaries and , more recently , in leaks to the press .
On the table are Viacom 's Madison Square Garden sports properties , Showtime pay-TV service and cable systems serving one million customers .
Under one approach , TCI would acquire Madison Square Garden and Viacom 's cable-TV operations .
Viacom is seeking at least $ 1 billion for the Garden , whose operations include a 20,000-seat arena , a performance theater , the regional cable-TV sports network and two professional sports franchises .
Under a second approach , the two companies would form a joint venture that would own the Garden and some cable systems of both concerns .
In addition , the two would combine their pay-TV services -- Viacom 's Showtime and TCI 's Encore .

NEW YORK -- IBM plans to return fire against Compaq Computer Corp. , slashing prices as much as 27 % on most business personal computers in an effort to stem a startling slide in shipments and regain ground lost to the Houston-based computer maker .
The price cuts , which International Business Machines Corp. is expected to announce today , had been anticipated because IBM is preparing to unveil an overhaul of its PC line next month .
But the timing was driven by Compaq 's price cuts of as much as 22 % last week , Bruce Claflin , an IBM general manager , said in an interview yesterday .
Some analysts said another volley from Compaq is possible , and IBM , of Armonk , N.Y. , indicated it would be willing to go another round .
`` We 'll never allow a competitor to get a meaningful price gap , '' Mr. Claflin said .
Compaq declined to comment .
A price war , however , could prove more costly for IBM , which is having a tumultuous year in its PC business .
Its second-quarter U.S. shipments dropped 29 % even as shipment volume at its four biggest rivals rose significantly .
IBM 's gross margins in the PC business are believed to be one-third lower than those of Compaq , which claims to be the market 's lowest-cost producer .
Only a year ago IBM had seemed to be on a comeback in the personal-computer market after several years of retreat .
But U.S. revenue actually declined in the second quarter for IBM 's PC unit and rose only 5 % world-wide .
Analysts say they believe the division is n't profitable .
Moreover , the rest of the year hangs in doubt as IBM overhauls the product line .
IBM is paying for a range of errors committed in the past year .
Determined to increase shipments , the company pumped some $ 600 million of inventory into wholesale and retail channels in the fourth quarter of last year .
While that helped IBM reclaim the No. 1 spot in market share for 1993 , it backfired on the company this year when dealers could n't sell all the goods .
In addition , IBM still has n't filled the severe shortage in its popular ThinkPad line of notebook computers ; it let the corporate PS\/2 line get undercut by its lower-priced ValuePoint series ; and it had a six-month delay in shipments of top-line PS\/2 models because of a technical glitch .
Dealers also complain that IBM had slowed the pace of price cuts , which the company denies .
And IBM has zigzagged on advertising strategy , hiring a new agency for its PC business only to fire the firm in favor of a new shop for all IBM products months later .
The woes of IBM Personal Computer Co. surprise observers who a year ago had viewed the division as a bright spot in IBM 's otherwise bleak outlook .
`` The worms are coming out of this can worse than I ever imagined , '' said analyst Jay Stevens of Dean Witter .
`` Nobody had any idea how rotten this was .
'' IBM 's Mr. Claflin countered , however , that the company has largely worked through the $ 600 million in swollen inventory from late last year , and that the ThinkPad shortage should be eliminated by year 's end .
In addition , the revamping of IBM 's full PC line slated for next month will seek to eliminate overlapping products , trim manufacturing and delivery costs and rationalize its marketing message .
Even with the new IBM price cuts , analysts expect Compaq to hold on to the No. 1 ranking it earned in the U.S. market in the first two quarters of this year .
In the second period , Compaq had a 14.3 % share of the U.S. market , according to Dataquest .
Apple Computer Inc. had an 11.2 % share , Packard Bell Electronics Inc. had 9.3 % and IBM trailed at 7.9 % .
So while the new price reductions , which IBM will grant to the retail channel immediately , will hurt IBM profit margins , the company ca n't afford to fail to respond .
The average reduction of 21 % will make IBM computers sell for about 5 % less than similar models from Compaq , IBM executives said .
The cuts target the server business most dramatically .
Servers , high-end computers that manage networks of smaller PCs , are the fastest-growing and most profitable segment of the PC industry .
IBM , a late entry , has been trying hard to catch up .
IBM is also aggressively cutting the prices of its subnotebooks , the smallest laptop models , and of ValuePoints and PS\/2s , desktops it sells to businesses .
Mr. Claflin said IBM wo n't cut prices on its hot-selling ThinkPad 750C , which remains in short supply .
IBM also wo n't cut prices on its consumer desktop line , the PS\/1 , which already has been discounted this year .
Martin Wolf , president of ComputerLand Corp. , Pleasanton , Calif. , one of IBM 's largest dealers , said he thought the price cuts from IBM were `` good , but not enough to solve the problem .
'' Mr. Wolf said he remains concerned about IBM 's recent record of poor forecasting of demand , a slowness to respond to rivals ' price reductions , and the company 's desire to be in every market .
By contrast , he said , `` Compaq is completely focused .
'' NEW YORK -- Individual investors snapped up a healthy portion of the government 's auction of new two-year notes yesterday , helping Treasury securities to carve out moderate price gains .
The gains were limited however , as the market faces still more new supply in the form of five-year notes today and as longer maturities remained captive to the ups and downs of the dollar .
The dollar slipped in late trading , prompting the 30-year bond to give back a sizable part of gains registered early in the day .
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose less than 1\/4 point to 99 14\/32 to yield 7.54 % , down from 7.55 % on Monday .
Thanks to the increases in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve this year , more and more investors are viewing short-term Treasury securities as an alternative to the still-low yields offered on bank certificates of deposit .
`` People are coming in off the street and buying , '' said Susan Nason , a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh .
Institutional investors , meanwhile , have stepped up purchases of short-term securities in the belief that after last week 's Fed tightening , rates wo n't be heading higher again until November .
Amid the uncertainty of the weeks leading up to the Fed 's rate increase on Aug. 16 , portfolio managers had allowed cash positions to build .
The end result was what traders described as solid , broad-based demand at the Treasury 's auction of $ 17.26 billion of two-year notes yesterday .
The Treasury awarded the offering at a yield of 6.27 % , a lower yield than most on Wall Street had expected .
By late yesterday , the new two-year yielded 6.26 % .
`` It was a terrific two-year sale , '' said Dana Johnson , head of market analysis at First Chicago Capital Markets .
Ms. Nason of Federated Investors noted that the yield offered on the two-year was at the upper end of the recent trading range , which helped soothe any concerns that yields would head sharply higher in coming sessions .
`` You could step in and feel some comfort owning it at these levels , '' she said .
The interest in the two-year notes by individual investors was reflected in the level of noncompetitive bids , which reached $ 1.5 billion .
And dealers bought aggressively , too .
The bid-to-cover ratio , which is a measure of overall demand comparing the number of bids tendered to those received , was well above average at 3.27-to-1 .
`` Dealers stepped up to the plate and bid for this one , '' said Ward McCarthy , a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates .
The short-term end of the market has `` traded very well since the Fed tightened and it seems like the place to be , '' he said .
Most 30-year bond traders , however , remained preoccupied with the ebb and flow of the dollar .
After a short period of stability , the dollar has been hurt in recent sessions by renewed jitters over the course of U.S.-Japan trade talks .
A declining dollar poses worries for the bond market .
In the short term , a falling dollar makes U.S. assets such as stocks and bonds less attractive , especially to foreign investors .
Longer term , a lower dollar poses an inflationary threat by raising the cost of imported goods .
Long-term securities headed higher during overseas trading early yesterday as the U.S. currency recouped some of the losses posted on Monday .
But late yesterday , the dollar slipped again , and the longer end of the bond market trimmed its gains .
After breaking above 98 yen in overseas activity , the dollar finished the day at 97.98 yen , compared with 97.85 late Monday .
`` The dollar gave bonds a bit of a lift , but then it lost some of its bid and the bond market faded from its highs , '' said Mr. Johnson of First Chicago .
The market 's attention now shifts to today 's $ 11 billion five-year note sale .
While the two-year note auction went well , that does n't mean the five-year will also be a breeze , players warned .
Because of its longer maturity , the five-year note typically does n't attract as much interest from individual investors .
And many traders view positions in the five-year note as a directional bet on the market .
Ms. Nason of Federated Investors said that at a 6.95 % yield late yesterday the five-year note was close to being a buy .
`` When five-year notes get over 7 % , you might have to look twice at them , '' she said .
Texas ' competitive sale of $ 1.7 billion of Series 1994 tax and revenue anticipation notes today will be an attention-grabber for reasons other than the offering 's size .
That 's because Texas is setting aside a maximum of $ 200 million of its latest TRANs for bids from minority-owned and women-owned firms .
Municipal bond prices ended generally higher in secondary dealings .
The price of the Florida Board of Education 's 6.10 % bonds of 2024 rose 1\/4 point to 97 5\/8 to yield 6.26 % .
The price of Portland , Ore. 's 6.25 % bonds of 2015 rose 1\/2 point to 100 to yield 6.23 % .
In its official notice of sale for the Texas issue , the state refers to women-owned and minority-owned firms as `` HUBs , '' which stands for historically underutilized businesses .
Some of the notes are being set apart to help obtain participation by women-owned and minority-owned firms in the large offering and to show other issuers that such firms can successfully be included in the competitive bidding process , said John Bell , Texas ' assistant deputy treasurer .
`` Our Legislature has asked us to try and get HUB involvement up , '' Mr. Bell said .
He added that `` our goal is to include more women and minority firms '' in this competitive offering .
Mr. Bell said Texas ' action should signal to other issuers that `` you can ensure HUB participation in competitive sales '' and not only in negotiated offerings .
The negotiated underwriting process , rather than the competitive method , is said to be the one that facilitates participation by minority-owned and women-owned firms .
The Texas TRANs have a 5.00 % coupon and will mature on Aug. 31 , 1995 .
In primary dealings yesterday , one of the larger offerings priced was Los Angeles 's $ 110.7 million of Series 1994A general obligation bonds .
The securities were won by a CS First Boston group with a bid setting the true interest cost at 5.855 % .
The bonds , which are rated double-A-1 by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and double-A by Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group , were priced for reoffering to yield from 4.10 % for notes maturing in 1995 to 6.20 % for bonds maturing in 2014 .
Insurance was added to bonds maturing between 1999 and 2014 , and they carry triple-A ratings from Moody 's and S&P .
Separately , Fitch Investors Service Inc. said it has rated the city and county of Denver 's $ 225 million of Series 1994A airport system revenue bonds triple-B-minus , due to continual postponements in the opening of Denver International Airport and the increased costs associated with these delays .
Fitch also lowered the $ 3.2 billion of outstanding parity bonds to triple-B-minus from triple-B .
The triple-B-minus rating is Fitch 's lowest investment-grade rating , the firm said .
R.H. Macy & Co. bonds took a tumble early yesterday when the New York attorney general threatened to object to the company 's merger with Federated Department Stores Inc. unless the merged company sells 12 Macy stores in the New York area .
The bonds traded down about a point , but quickly rebounded when market players concluded that the company would probably be able to choose which stores it sells .
Otherwise , the corporate bond market was quiet with only federal agencies issuing new debt , selling $ 200 million of debt .
Trading in the secondary markets was also light with spreads over Treasurys unchanged , said traders who are grumbling about the market 's inactivity .
The junk bond market was also quiet with prices up about 1\/4 point , one trader said .
Two of PepsiCo Inc. 's subsidiaries in Poland plan to issue 550 billion zlotys -LRB- $ 24.2 million -RRB- in short-term debt , in a move that marks PepsiCo 's first commercial-paper offering outside the U.S. and Poland 's first such short-term corporate debt issue .
Proceeds from the notes , to be issued by PepsiCo Trading Ltd. and PepsiCo Poland Ltd. initially with a maturity of one month , will be used to cover the short-term financing needs of the company 's beverage and restaurant subsidiaries in Poland .
The commercial paper will be offered over a two-year period and PepsiCo will guarantee repayment of the notes .
Peter R. Thompson , an assistant treasurer for PepsiCo whose office handled the issue 's structuring , expects the first issue to be placed next week .
Rates for the issue will be negotiated on the day of issue .
PepsiCo , based in Purchase , N.Y. , owns beverage , restaurant and snack-food businesses around the world , but until now has always met its commercial-paper funding needs in the U.S. market .
Last August , PepsiCo announced that its subsidiaries plan to invest more than $ 500 million in Poland through 1998 .
Poland is PepsiCo 's largest country of operations in Central Europe , with its beverage , restaurant and snack-food divisions all expanding aggressively .
`` It 's expensive to borrow from banks '' in Poland , Mr. Thompson said .
A one-month bank loan for PepsiCo in Poland would carry an annualized interest rate of roughly 34 % , according to representatives of ING Bank , whose Warsaw office arranged the offer with PepsiCo .
Prices of mortgage-backed securities climbed 1\/8 to 1\/4 point in step with Treasurys in light trading .
In the collateralized mortgage obligations market , Kidder , Peabody & Co. is offering a $ 500 million issue of a Federal National Mortgage Association real estate mortgage investment conduit backed by 30-year 8.5 % securities .
Discount-coupon pass-throughs , or securities that trade below par , gained the most from improved sentiment in the bond market .
Discount-coupon securities have the longest duration of all pass-throughs and generally register the highest price gain in a bullish market .
Duration measures the sensitivity of a security to a prevailing interest rate .
Typically , the longer the duration , the higher the price volatility of a security .
Mortgagebacked securities are also affected by the rate of payment on the underlying mortgages .
Discount pass-throughs are being priced to a worst-case scenario of the slowest of all possible payment schedules on the underlying mortgages , thus limiting any downside risk , traders said .
Wall Street firms are divided on the outlook for discount pass-throughs vs. their premium counterparts .
While some firms including Bear , Stearns & Co. have been advocating the upside potential of discount securities , other investment banks including Salomon Brothers Inc. are arguing that investors are better off earning the higher coupon from premium securities in a range-bound market .
In secondary trading , Government National Mortgage Association 8 % issues for September delivery ended 6\/32 higher at 98 23\/32 .
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 8 % Gold issues ended 5\/32 higher at 99 .
Fannie Mae 8 % issues ended 5\/32 higher at 98 29\/32 .

To disabled athletes , `` Blaze '' -- a colorful illustration of a phoenix with a proudly puffed-out chest -- is a symbol of courage , perseverance and triumph .
But within the Olympic movement -- and within its disabled-sports counterpart , the Paralympics-Blaze is becoming a symbol of conflict .
Yesterday , in federal court in Atlanta , organizers of the 1996 Paralympic Games sued the U.S. Olympic Committee over the rights to use Blaze , the Paralympic mascot , in licensing and merchandising arrangements .
At stake , among other things , are millions of dollars in revenue -- money that could be used to help stage the Paralympic Games , which have a $ 100 million budget .
The intensity of the dispute , which has been simmering behind the scenes for some time , illustrates the rising value that sports marketers are placing on once-neglected mascots .
The battle also reflects disabled-sports ' officials growing dissatisfaction with the level of U.S. support for disabled athletics .
Paralympic organizers created Blaze , unveiled last March , largely to promote and raise money for the Paralympic Games , a quadrennial event featuring competition among the world 's best wheelchair marathoners , blind swimmers and other elite athletes with physical disabilities .
The next competition will take place in Atlanta in August 1996 , immediately following the Summer Olympics .
Last year , however , some of those same Paralympic officials signed a joint marketing agreement with the U.S. Olympic Committee , giving the committee broad governance over the use of Paralympic names , marks , logos and symbols for the 1996 Paralympic Games .
In the action filed yesterday , Paralympic organizers -- under the auspices of the Atlanta Paralympic Organizing Committee and the U.S. Disabled Athletes Fund -- claimed that Blaze belongs to the entire Paralympic movement , which will live long beyond 1996 .
The U.S. Olympic Committee , however , has argued that Blaze 's current licensing rights clearly belong to it under the marketing agreement .
John Krimsky Jr. , deputy secretary general of the committee , called the court filing `` precipitous '' and `` unfortunate '' in an interview yesterday .
`` They should withdraw it and reverse their position , '' said Mr. Krimsky .
Only $ 5 million of the $ 100 million necessary to put on the 1996 Paralympic Games in Atlanta is budgeted to come from licensing and merchandising .
But according to Paralympic officials , Blaze 's reception so far has given them hope of raising much more .
In June , for instance , Fox Inc. 's Twentieth Century Fox Licensing and Merchandising division signed on as world-wide licensing representative for the Paralympic Games .
Fox may feature Blaze in television shows and comic books .
Other sports mascots have become cash cows .
Striker , the feisty dog representing the World Cup , was featured on more than a third of the $ 750 million of retail merchandise sold by World Cup promoters , according to Jeffrey Bliss , senior vice president of World Cup 1994 marketing .
Izzy , the blue wormlike mascot of the Summer Olympics in Atlanta , is expected to account for millions of dollars in sales by 1996 .
`` Licensing and merchandising through mascots has become a huge revenue source for teams and leagues , '' Mr. Bliss said .
Paralympic officials `` have a very good opportunity to turn Blaze into a unique mark for the movement .
'' The battle over Blaze is only the most recent dispute among U.S. Olympic Committee officials and disabled-sports advocates .
In recent years , disabled-sports organizations have been asking for greater representation on the committee 's various governing bodies .
The committee 's 100-member board has just one disabled-sports representative , and the powerful Athletes ' Advisory Council has no disabled-sports representatives among its more than 40 members .
Earlier this month , a group of disabled-sports organizations submitted written testimony to a U.S. Senate panel conducting hearings on the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 , which grants the U.S. Olympic Committee authority over most nonprofessional sports programs in the country .
`` The Amateur Sports Act falls far short in ensuring equal treatment for athletes with disabilities and other targeted groups , '' said a group called the U.S. Disabled Sports Team , in its testimony .
The statement called for a wide range of amendments to the law .
The president of the Atlanta Paralympic Committee , Andrew Fleming , acknowledged that the U.S. Olympic Committee has some claim to Blaze when the mascot is specifically linked to the 1996 Paralympic Games .
But he contends that revenue from the mascot standing alone belongs exclusively to the Paralympic movement .
Moreover , he argues that Paralympic organizers should n't be required to clear every usage of Blaze with Olympic Committee officials .
Two New Jersey trash-hauling brothers who won a landmark Supreme Court case against municipal control of trash were indicted on charges of running a racketeering enterprise and defrauding a Bergen County , N.J. , agency of nearly $ 22.5 million .
In a 31-count indictment yesterday , a state grand jury in New Jersey charged brothers Carmine and Salvatore Franco of Bergen County , four of their adult children , two of their businesses and two employees with conspiracy to commit racketeering .
The defendants also were charged with theft , operating an unauthorized solid-waste business , falsifying and tampering with records , and filing fraudulent tax returns , among other things .
The Francos recently won a battle against municipal sanitation chiefs when the Supreme Court ruled that local governments could n't prohibit trash haulers from shipping garbage to other states for cheaper disposal .
Last week , however , the House Energy and Commerce Committee approved a bill that would restore some municipal authority .
Yesterday , New Jersey Attorney General Deborah T. Poritz said the indictment claims the Franco brothers continued to control and operate their solid-waste businesses with the help of family members after being barred by law in the mid-1980s from any participation in the solid-waste industry .
The brothers are alleged to have ties to organized crimes , but they have denied such allegations .
The indictment also claims that one of the Franco businesses , Sal Car Transfer Systems Inc. , failed to transfer solid waste picked up in Bergen County to the Bergen County Utilities Authority and instead shipped the waste unlawfully to landfills in other states .
This practice , the indictment says , defrauded the county authority of about $ 22.5 million .
If convicted on all counts , the brothers face a substantial prison sentence and a maximum fine of $ 760,000 each .
The two family businesses , Sal Car Transfer Systems and Northeastern Recycling Co. could be fined as much as $ 2.3 million and $ 660,000 respectively .
Salvatore Franco said he was unaware of the details of the indictment and would n't comment until he conferred with his attorneys .

NEW YORK -- The dollar firmed and biotechnology and technology stocks surged , providing small-company issues with broad gains .
The Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks jumped 1.75 , or 0.70 % , to 251.49 .

AT&T Corp. 's computer unit and Delta Air Lines agreed to form a joint venture that will manage Delta 's huge information-processing operations and sell similar services to other travel and transportation companies .
The new company , which awaits a formal name and chief executive , has been practically guaranteed $ 2.8 billion in revenue from equipment and services purchases by Delta during the next 10 years , the companies said .
It wo n't include Delta 's separate reservation system , which is incorporated in another joint venture .
Chief beneficiaries of the new venture will be two businesses in search of a boost : Delta , whose skies have been cloudy with losses , and AT&T 's Global Information Solutions unit , formerly NCR Corp. .
The Atlanta-based air carrier has lagged rivals in setting up efficient information systems for managing operations and promoting reservations .
At the same time , Delta is seeking to sharply trim about $ 2 billion in annual overhead as it struggles to return to profitability .
AT&T 's GIS has been seeking to recover from sluggish computer and services revenue that has caused the unit to post operating losses during the past two years .
In its most recent quarter , the Dayton , Ohio , unit posted a $ 14 million profit on an 11 % jump in revenue to $ 2 billion .
Ronald W. Allen , Delta 's chairman , said the partnership with AT&T will `` improve Delta 's competitiveness '' and allow it to offer travelers `` fast , more complete information .
'' For Delta `` information is a key strategic asset , '' said AT&T chairman Robert E. Allen , `` and they 're trusting us to manage it for them .
'' But in the cut-throat data-management market called `` outsourcing , '' huge rivals await the AT&T - Delta team .
These include Electronic Data Systems , the technology unit of General Motors Corp. , and International Business Machines Corp. 's Integrated Systems Solutions Corp. .
Each company boasts billions in outsourcing revenue and hundreds of business clients .
Data-industry analysts were mostly blase .
`` We 're still trying to figure out from the announcement if this is a nonevent or if it lacks imagination , '' said George Logemann , an analyst at Boston researcher Yankee Group .
He said that the $ 400 million Delta expects to save in lower costs over 10 years is `` small change ... less than the 15 % savings that most American companies look for when they make major operating changes to cut costs .
'' Seeing a me-too business arrangement , Ken McGee , of Gartner Group , Stamford , Conn. , found the AT&T - Delta venture `` very consistent with what I 've been seeing in the outsourcing industry .
'' Still , the new venture should provide some lift .
It will have more than $ 200 million in guaranteed annual revenue from Delta .
It also will have 1,200 employees drawn mostly from Delta but also from AT&T GIS .
Delta expects additional benefits from being able to push off the costs associated with maintaining its back-office operations onto the new unit , which will be managed primarily by AT&T GIS .
In fact , AT&T 's GIS beat out EDS to become Delta 's venture partner .
Delta had put out a request for proposals from technology companies more than a year ago in its quest to cut its computer costs .
AT&T GIS and EDS were the finalists , according to people close to the new venture .
EDS , in any event , may have had a conflict .
EDS currently has agreements with System One Information Management Inc. , the reservations unit of rival Continental Airlines , to manage the data-processing and telecommunications facilities services used by the airline and System One .
That connection , says Tom Woodall , publisher of the newsletter CRS Update , `` was undoubtedly a factor '' in Delta 's selection of AT&T over EDS .
The new venture expects to pick a CEO and a seven-member board by the end of the year at which time the company should be open for business , the companies said .
It will be based in the Atlanta area .
The venture announced yesterday is quite similar to a move Delta made several years ago with its computer-reservations system .
One of the last major airlines to develop such a system , Delta in 1989 at first tried to merge its DATAS-II unit with AMR Corp. 's highly profitable Sabre system .
But the Justice Department objected .
So Delta formed a reservations joint venture the following year with Northwest Airlines and Trans World Airlines .
Now , their Worldspan , as the venture was named , has 23.5 % of U.S. reservation systems market vs. Sabre 's 35 % , Mr. Woodall said .
Kopin Corp. , Tauton , Mass. , said it agreed with two U.S. units of the Netherlands-based Philips Electronics NV to develop liquid-crystal-display systems jointly for projection color televisions and other products .
Terms were n't disclosed .
Kopin 's stock jumped $ 1 , or 6.1 % , to close at $ 17.50 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday .
Kopin said the companies plan to develop `` active-matrix '' displays using Kopin 's Smart Slide imaging device .
Philips will be the primary maker of the assembled displays .
`` Certain products '' produced under the agreement are expected to be available in 1995 .
Kopin also signed a pact with Philips Laboratories , Briarcliff Manor , N.Y. , to develop liquid-crystal-display products based on a Philips technology for color video images .
Newbridge Networks Corp. reported lower-than-estimated revenue and earnings in its 1995 first quarter because of delayed shipments and higher costs .
The Kanata , Ontario-based telecommunications-equipment maker said its fiscal first-quarter earnings were up 31 % from a year earlier , less than the increase analysts had originally estimated .
Newbridge 's earnings for the quarter ended July 30 rose to 41.9 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 30.5 million -RRB- , or 50 cents a share , from C$ 32 million , or 38 cents a share , a year earlier .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading , Newbridge shares fell 9.2 % to close at $ 29 , down $ 2.9375 .
Revenue rose 49 % to C$ 171.4 million from C$ 115.3 million a year earlier .
Newbridge issued a statement Aug. 1 warning that its first-quarter earnings would be below analysts ' estimates .
REPUBLICANS SAID they would block a crime bill unless Democrats revise it .
A group of 41 GOP senators , enough to derail the $ 30.2 billion measure , were preparing to vote against a motion allowing consideration of the bill passed by the House .
The Republicans want to kill the ban on semi-automatic assault weapons included in the bill , cut its spending for crime prevention and strengthen law-enforcement provisions .
Minority Leader Dole discussed 13 proposed changes with Senate Majority Leader Mitchell , who expressed willingness to schedule separate votes on the changes , but only after there is a vote on the pending bill .
Dole said he and his Republican colleagues would meet to consider Mitchell 's suggestion , but added , `` It 's probably a nonstarter .
'' White House officials are voicing pessimism about their chances of salvaging significant health-care legislation from Congress this year .

The appointment of Karl Theodor Paschke could clear the way for Washington to pay some of the $ 1.4 billion it owes the U.N. Sunday 's elections in Mexico do not exactly represent the consummation of a new democratic political order , but they are surely an important milepost along the way .
If nothing else , voters punctured the myth of the Mexican left .
The result is the beginning of a modern two-party system , with the reformist wing of the governing party and its traditional conservative opposition arrayed as competing but fundamentally centrist forces .
These elections were perhaps the most closely scrutinized in the history of mankind , so inevitably there are reports of irregularities and difficulties , magnified by suspicions left by the historical tactics of the long-dominant PRI .
The ritual leftist rallies against fraud produced a few TV pictures , but in fact so far have displayed anything but conviction .
While there can be room for dispute over precise percentages , few serious observers saw any reason to doubt the general thrust of results .
To wit , the PRI 's Ernesto Zedillo gathered about 49 % of the vote , with some 28 % going to Diego Fernandez of the traditionalist PAN .
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist PRD got less than 17 % .
The PRI 's legislative majority looks solid , and voter turnout surged to 70 % , presumably because voters thought their ballots would count .
In policy terms , this represents a solid endorsement of the reformist wing of the PRI .
Under President Carlos Salinas and his predecessor Miguel de la Madrid , Mexico abandoned its historical autarkic economic policy in favor of opening to the world and moving toward a free market at home .
Such policies have long been favored by the PAN , and by election time Mr. Cardenas was accepting them as well .
Political reform has come at a slower pace , but a forward one .
Sunday 's election is all the more impressive in light of the turmoil that marked the campaign : the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio , the original PRI candidate , and the curious armed uprising in the poor southern state of Chiapas .
Conducting a smooth election under these circumstances suggests a certain political depth .
Mr. Zedillo was the first PRI candidate to agree to debates with his challengers , a circumstance that proved golden for Mr. Fernandez and disastrous for Mr. Cardenas .
Mr. Zedillo also adopted Mr. Colosio 's rhetoric about the need to separate the PRI and the government and allow a multiparty system to develop .
He even pledged not to participate in nominating the next PRI presidential candidate , which would be a historic change in the political system in which each President has in effect designated his successor .
None of this is to say that Mexico is about to become as democratic as , say , Minnesota .
The ultimate test of a full democracy is the peaceful transfer of power from one party to another , which in Mexico this week still seems a distant possibility .
Still , it 's hard to demand that the PRI should commit political suicide instead of reforming itself in line with the desires of the electorate .
Even partial success at the latter deserves praise .
The question for Mr. Zedillo 's Presidency will be whether Mexico can make the last jump to development , traversing the economic and political barriers that arise as growth begins in earnest and expectations mount .
Its long-term stability will depend on whether it can provide opportunities for its legions of poor but ambitious peasants to emerge as a middle class .
And on whether the PRI can follow its promises of political openness , whether the left can forsake empty but disruptive gestures -LRB- further street rallies are scheduled for this weekend -RRB- , and whether the PAN can overcome its historically understandable resentments and emerge as an opposition loyal to the system .
In all this the United States has enormous interests .
The Clinton Administration recognized as much in its successful battle for the North American Free Trade Agreement , surely an enormous boon to stability south of the Rio Grande .
One thing that even ordinary American citizens can do is simply to try to understand their neighbor , to shed the inattention and stereotypes that have too often clouded the view toward the south .
Sunday 's elections are surely a case in point .
Mr. Cardenas , the son of the President who founded the PRI and nationalized the oil companies , was roundly rejected by modern Mexican voters .
Yet somehow there has been a long-standing notion that Mexico is a cauldron of leftist , anti-gringo resentment .
Where did this stereotype ever come from ?
Mainly , we suppose , from the historical PRI , which talked the populist rhetoric of the left while governing in the interests of an entrenched and wealthy right .
But also from the interpretation of Mexico and the rest of Latin America by a small band of left-leaning intellectuals on both sides of the Rio Grande , a circumstance less their fault than of others who abdicated to them .
The broad center of American society should take heart from the Mexican elections .
Its ideas of free enterprise and democracy produced a strong resonance in what is still a poor and sometimes cynical electorate .
If this can happen in Mexico , why not in every developing nation ?

NEW YORK -- Ralph Lauren sold 28 % of his New York fashion house to a Goldman Sachs & Co. investment fund for $ 135 million , marking the first time in the company 's 26-year history that Mr. Lauren and his business partner Peter Strom have shared ownership with an outsider .
Mr. Lauren , whose Polo and Ralph Lauren designer labels are popular with the Ivy League and country-club set , is expected to use a large portion of the money to expand the company 's retail operation .
But the investment , which was made through Goldman Sachs affiliate GS Capital Partners L.P. , also will allow the designer to take some cash out of the company .
During a joint interview yesterday at Polo 's Madison Avenue headquarters , Mr. Lauren and Stephen Friedman , Goldman Sachs 's chairman , characterized Goldman 's investment in closely held Polo\/Ralph Lauren Corp. as `` passive .
'' Mr. Friedman said Goldman is making a `` long-term investment , '' and it wo n't hold any seats on Polo 's board and does n't plan to take the company public .
`` We think that it is a good investment and there 's a lot of growth potential for us in the future , '' Mr. Friedman said .
He said Goldman has been investment banker for Polo since 1988 and will continue to `` advise and counsel '' the company .
Mr. Lauren , 54 years old , said he and Mr. Strom , 65 , will continue to remain actively involved in the company .
Mr. Lauren founded Polo in 1968 with a $ 50,000 investment .
Even with Goldman 's investment , he continues to control the biggest stake in the design company .
Mr. Lauren 's share of Polo is now down to 65 % from 90 % ; Mr. Strom 's share is 7 % , down from 10 % .
Mr. Friedman said the investment in Polo is the largest made so far by GS Capital Partners , a $ 1 billion investment fund that was started in 1992 .
It is 30 % owned by Goldman , with the remaining interest held by Goldman clients .
Mr. Lauren characterized the Goldman investment as a `` fantastic thing for me , '' allowing the company to remain private while it continues to pursue its world-wide growth strategy .
Noting that fashion companies require huge investments in order to expand , he said , `` There are lots of opportunities that I want to be prepared for , '' including opening more stores in the U.S. and abroad .
`` Everything is going good , and the company is on track for record earnings this year , '' Mr. Lauren said .
`` I want to make sure that all is well for the future .
'' He declined to disclose any earnings figures .
He said the Polo empire generates about $ 3.9 billion at retail annually .
The company itself sells men 's sportswear , dress shirts and ties , and licenses hundreds of products in apparel , fragrances and home furnishings .
Polo owns more than half of its 55 U.S. stores and a store in London and licenses 50 factory outlets and 74 stores internationally .
What exactly Goldman is receiving remains unclear .
The company said the 28 % stake includes `` some '' of Polo 's many licenses , it but declined to say how many or which ones .
Based on the price of Goldman 's stake , Polo\/Ralph Lauren has an equity value of about $ 500 million , not including the licenses retained by Mr. Lauren and Mr. Strom .
While the Goldman investment will provide significant financial backing for Polo , `` the real question to be determined is exactly what are the company 's growth plans for the future , '' said Gilbert Harrison , chairman of Financo Inc. Polo may be `` close to saturation in the U.S. , '' Mr. Harrison said , adding , `` It appears that there is enormous potential for future growth not only in Europe but in the Far East .
'' Ralph Lauren , Donna Karan and Calvin Klein , he added , are `` the premier American design firms known throughout the world .
'' Saying he does n't have access to Polo 's financial statements , Mr. Harrison said , `` An investment like this is either made because of growth potential or that the company has matured to the point where it generates sufficient cash to ensure appropriate returns .
'' Despite Goldman 's and Mr. Lauren 's insistence that they wo n't take the company public , some Wall Street analysts said partnerships like Goldman 's typically prefer to be short-term investors .
These analysts said they would n't be surprised if Polo eventually became a public concern .
Yesterday Mr. Lauren said that `` my goal is to build a retail business , '' especially more free-standing stores , such as his newer formats , Polo Sport active-sportswear and Double RL jeanswear shops .
In order to compete in today 's retail marketplace , he said , `` you have to have the money to blow them out .
'' Much of his attention will be on Double RL , which was launched last year but has had a difficult time clicking with the college set with its $ 60 to $ 100 jeans and $ 80 sport shirts .
`` In order to build a big business in denim , you really need to advertise , '' Mr. Lauren said .

Though surprised by the swelling tide of Cuban rafters , the Clinton adminstration is holding fast to its policy of denying them entry to the U.S. After a two-hour meeting of President Clinton and his top advisers yesterday , an administration aide said the officials believe the U.S. could handle a significant inflow of Cubans by expanding capacity at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and by soon adding third-country sites to be used as safe havens .
Although a variety of options were discussed , the main message the administration sought to send following yesterday 's White House meeting was that the fleeing Cubans were n't going to get to the U.S. , `` not now or anytime , '' a U.S. official insisted .
In Miami 's Cuban-American community , there was some wariness that the rising refugee numbers could drive President Clinton to the negotiating table with Cuban leader Fidel Castro , and that Mr. Castro had been able to turn the situation to his advantage , converting Cuba 's deepseated economic and political crisis into an immigration nightmare for the U.S. Expressing support for the Clinton policy , Rafael Penalver , a prominent local attorney , said : `` We ca n't permit that Castro blackmails the U.S. to the negotiating table .
'' For the moment , barring entry to the U.S. , a policy that quickly stanched the flow of Haitian boat people earlier this summer , has had the opposite effect with the fleeing Cubans .
According to wire-service reports , by midafternoon yesterday , the Coast Guard already had picked up 1,757 Cubans .
That was in addition to the 2,548 picked up on Monday , the largest single-day total since the 1980 boatlift brought 125,000 Cubans to Florida 's shores over five months .
The administration has been holding talks about providing safe havens with Suriname , Saint Lucia , Dominica , Antigua , Grenada , Costa Rica , Honduras , Guatemala , El Salvador , Panama and , ironically , Nicaragua , once Mr. Castro 's Marxist ally in the hemisphere .
Officials also said that the capacity to hold about 10,000 Cubans at Guantanamo , already crowded with almost 15,000 restless Haitians , could be expanded by about 3,500 .
Pentagon officials said that before yesterday 's totals , about 1,200 Cubans were already at Guantanamo and that another 4,600 were en route aboard various U.S. vessels .

A shareholder of SysteMed Inc. , a prescription-benefits manager , sued the company in Delaware Chancery Court seeking to enjoin the company 's recent adoption of a `` poison pill '' antitakeover provision .
The Laguna Hills , Calif. , company adopted the provision earlier this month after National Intergroup Inc. , Dallas , said it had raised its stake in SysteMed to 7.8 % and might propose a merger or other steps .
The suit was filed by Croyden Associates , identified as a Florida partnership .
Judith Archbold , SysteMed 's general counsel , said the company was aware of the suit but had n't been served with it .
She declined to comment further .

NEW YORK -- PaineWebber Inc. 's underwriting of Megafoods Stores Inc. 's junk bonds is shaping up to be a megamess .
Only 10 months ago , investment bankers from the PaineWebber Group subsidiary hit the underwriting circuit , trying to persuade institutional investors to buy $ 100 million of Megafoods junk bonds .
PaineWebber got the deal done .
But now it 's having to pay a price .
Last week , when the Mesa , Ariz. , supermarket chain filed for bankruptcy-law protection , PaineWebber was stuck holding slightly more than $ 15 million of the bonds that it bought from institutional clients who had scrambled to unload the securities when prices started to fall .
People close to the firm said PaineWebber 's purchases have left it with an estimated paper loss of as much as $ 10 million .
What 's more , the brokerage firm , along with Megafoods and its officers , is facing a suit from a group of bondholders who allege that the prospectus for the bond offering last fall did n't accurately describe Megafoods ' business prospects .
The suit , filed in U.S. district court in Arizona , seeks class-action status .
In a separate suit filed in the same court , a shareholders group is making similar allegations against Megafoods and its officers .
A PaineWebber spokesman said the bondholder suit has no merit and the firm intends to defend it vigorously .
A lawyer for Megafoods said the company has n't had the opportunity to fully study the allegations yet .
However , he added , the company `` believes its bond offering was conducted in full compliance of federal and state securities laws .
'' PaineWebber 's problems with Megafoods come at a particularly ticklish time .
Earlier this summer , PaineWebber , facing suits from investors over losses in its short-term government bond fund , said it would inject $ 33 million to cover the losses and would spend $ 235 million buying back risky mortgage derivatives from the fund .
Those moves resulted in a second-quarter loss for the firm .
And the Megafoods blowup may be a prelude to other junk-bond problems associated with PaineWebber 's high-yield operations .
Rally 's Hamburgers Inc. , a Louisville , Ky. , fast-food chain , sold $ 75 million of senior notes through PaineWebber in March 1993 .
Earlier this month , Rally 's posted a loss and said its second-quarter results put it in default of a certain covenant in its $ 5 million revolving credit facility .
Rally 's bonds have fallen 40 % since December and were trading at about 55 cents on the dollar yesterday .
Meanwhile , people close to PaineWebber said the firm also owns a relatively large position -- believed to be about $ 14 million -- in some Kash n ' Karry Food Stores Inc. bonds .
The bonds have plunged 64 % since about March , when PaineWebber is believed to have started accumulating the bonds .
Last month , Kash n ' Karry said it planned to miss its August interest payment on $ 240 million of public bonds outstanding .
The Tampa , Fla. , grocery chain already is in technical violation of covenants in its bank-credit agreement , but has received an extension on its waivers until September .
PaineWebber declined to comment on its position in Kash n ' Karry .
PaineWebber 's problems with Megafoods illustrate the difficulties of trying to break into the top ranks of junk-bond underwriters .
Last year , PaineWebber was ranked 16th among the top 20 underwriters of public junk bonds , managing $ 356.1 million of high-yield bond offerings in the public markets .
To build its franchise , the firm has had to resort to underwriting deals that other , larger firms would likely reject , some analysts contend .
`` If you are an issuer of high-yield bonds , you shop the biggest underwriters , '' said Richard Lehman , publisher of the Defaulted Bond newsletter in Miami Lakes , Fla. `` And when they turn you down , you keep shopping until you find someone who wants to establish a niche in the market .
'' PaineWebber `` is clearly a small fry in this market , '' he said , `` so they have to end up underwriting the stuff other people do n't want .
'' PaineWebber officials dispute this , arguing that underwriting deals from shoddy companies is n't a sound strategy to build market share .
`` It is not helpful to underwrite poor credits to break into a business , '' said Robert W. Pangia , PaineWebber 's head of investment banking .
`` The No. 1 rule to develop a business is to underwrite good credits .
'' Since 1992 , Mr. Pangia said , the firm has underwritten 31 junk-bond deals in the private and public market , and only three are flagging .
Unlike offerings sold in the public market , private high-yield deals are generally sold to only savvy institutional investors .
`` We are proud of our record since 1991 , '' said Mr. Pangia .
`` We really have improved our operation from origination to sales and I think it is being borne out by the deals being done , notwithstanding the recent Megafoods situation .
'' Still , in the case of Megafoods , several Wall Street junk-bond analysts and claimants in the PaineWebber suit question whether the firm used good judgment when it stepped up to the plate to provide financing for the company .
Max Holmes , a junk-bond analyst at Salomon Brothers , said Megafoods ' strategy was `` unbelievably bad .
'' He contends that the company 's continued growth depended on expanding into the fiercely competitive San Antonio market , where bigger supermarket chains such as Kroger 's had failed to make a mark .
`` Who could possibly think they were smart enough to say , ` Where Kroger failed , we , with our much higher cost of capital , can triumph ?
' '' he said .
Added Brian Doyle , head of high-yield research at Citicorp Securities : `` Senior executives with successful food-store chains had questions about Megafoods ' acquisitions and its strategy .
'' Mr. Doyle said Megafoods might have heeded the lesson of Food Lion , another grocery chain that tried to expand rapidly in Texas but failed badly .
Frank M. Placenti , a lawyer for Megafoods , said the company believes that notwithstanding some early difficulties in the San Antonio market , it is positioned to turn the corner there .
Disputing suggestions that Megafoods ' strategy was flawed , he said San Antonio is the ninth-largest city in the country and has only three major grocery chains .
PaineWebber officials said it is easy to criticize in hindsight .
`` I do n't want to leave the impression that we did not do our due diligence , '' said Mr. Pangia .
`` This is a company that we had known for a while .
We bought into the superwarehouse club concept and we thought it could be successfully transplanted to San Antonio .
'' MEXICO CITY -- Mexican and foreign observers raised new questions about the fairness of Sunday 's Mexican presidential elections , but they appeared to be divided on whether the irregularities played a significant role in the commanding lead of ruling-party candidate Ernesto Zedillo .
The findings , no matter what the conclusion , should put more pressure on the incoming government of Dr. Zedillo , an economist , to further democratize his authoritarian party , known as the PRI , and make it less prone to election fraud .
Already , Dr. Zedillo has called for a national dialogue with all opposition parties to form a common platform to govern Mexico .
Civic Alliance , the largest election-watchdog group , said its members detected `` serious irregularities '' in the weekend polling .
The alliance had previously indicated its observers had found some problems , but it said yesterday that there were widespread questions about the accuracy of the voting lists posted at polling places .
`` There is a big debate within Civic Alliance about whether the irregularities are high but the results stand , '' said Primitivo Rodriguez , a Civic Alliance leader , `` or whether there are enough irregularities to change the outcome , meaning there was fraud and Zedillo ca n't govern .
'' The group 's decision will play an important role in giving credibility to any calls by the opposition parties for civil unrest .
For that reason , at least one cabinet minister has been pushing Civic Alliance to characterize the elections as `` fair .
'' Meanwhile , foreign observers stopped short of calling the elections fair , citing numerous irregularities .
They did praise highly the unprecedented turnout of 70 % as a sign of voter confidence in the process .
But Paul Kirk , former chairman of the Democratic National Committee in the U.S. , said the delegation received `` no evidence to suggest irregularities affected the outcome of the presidential contest .
'' With 75 % of the votes counted as of late yesterday , Dr. Zedillo led with 49 % of the votes .
In second place was Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the center-right PAN , with 28 % .
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , of the leftist PRD , was third with 17 % .
Nearly complete results show the PRI winning a majority in the lower house , where some had thought the ruling party could be reduced to less than 45 % .
The PRI will retain its historic control of the Senate , but because of complex changes , one-fourth of the seats will automatically go to the opposition .
In a surprise blow for the center-right PAN , partial voting results showed the PRI winning in the border states of Baja California and Chihuahua , both of which have PAN governors .
But it appeared possible that the PAN would register majorities in two states with PRI governors , the central state of Jalisco and the border state of Nuevo Leon , home of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari .
In the southernmost state of Chiapas , scene of an armed uprising in January , it appeared a PRI governor was elected .
In the state 's rebel-held zone , though , voting was 8-to-1 for the leftist PRD , whose gubernatorial candidate , a newspaper editor , was injured in a highway crash last month .
The family blamed the incident on the ruling party .
Tokyo stocks edged down broadly in thin dealings Tuesday , despite support from Japanese public funds and the U.S. dollar 's rebound against the Japanese yen in currency dealings .
The Hong Kong market plunged 2.4 % , following an extremely disappointing government auction of property .
London shares finished little changed , though they did recover from early weakness .
Frankfurt prices recorded sharp losses , but they , too , rebounded from even deeper lows .
World-wide , stock prices fell in dollar terms .
The Dow Jones World Stock Index was at 118.69 , down 0.05 , reflecting lower Asia\/Pacific and European markets and higher markets in the Americas .

Losers outnumbered gainers , 664-290 .
The Tokyo Stock Price Index , or Topix , of all first-section issues , which fell 6.37 points Monday , dropped 5.66 to 1631.79 .
After opening weakly , the market could n't sustain midmorning and early-afternoon gains , which came partly as the dollar recovered against the yen , following aggressive intervention by Japan 's central bank in the currency market .
A much-waited flow of public funds , such as from postal insurance funds , to buy positions also propped up the market , before it lost ground later to unwinding of arbitrage positions triggered by weaker stock-index futures prices .
Japanese corporate investors also began to take profits ahead of the Sept. 30 close of the fiscal first half .
In London , the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index added just 3.8 points to 3175.1 , which also was the session peak after rebounding from the day 's low of 3161.1 .
The FT 30-stock index edged up 3.3 points to 2489.7 .
Volume was 554.7 million shares , compared with 499.1 million shares a day earlier .
Prices managed to finish in positive territory following a pickup in stock-index futures and a markedly higher start on Wall Street .
Earlier , depressed British government bonds and lower stock-index futures weighed on the bourse , its lackluster performance attributed mainly to a lack of fresh economic data and corporate news .
In Frankfurt , marking its fourth decline in a row , the DAX 30-stock index lost 15.92 points to 2107.87 , but recovered from the day 's trough of 2086.93 .
Auto shares , which are strongly weighted in the DAX , were among the biggest losers on a disappointing sales outlook .
The weak dollar and German bond market also continued to weigh on sentiment .
In Paris , shares rallied 1.4 % , boosted by a late surge following a turnaround in the French bond market and a stronger opening for New York stocks , though turnover on the French stock exchange was thin .
In Amsterdam , despite a weaker dollar , equities rose in line with gains in London and early on Wall Street and in reaction to generally favorable first-half earnings reports from major Dutch companies .
In Milan , stocks advanced amid speculative activity that reversed an early loss of almost 1 % , though volume was light .
In Madrid , prices rose , boosted by gains for issues that also trade as American depositary receipts when the U.S. market opened .
In Stockholm , the bourse retreated , mainly because of rising Swedish interest rates and renewed uncertainty about future money-market trends ; a jump in bond yields weighed on the market , where banking , investment and forestry shares logged declines .
In Zurich , stocks finished little changed in choppy dealings , after a rebounding dollar and strong start on Wall Street prompted late buying , which erased early losses linked to widespread worries about the weak dollar and signs of higher interest rates .
In Brussels , shares scored solid gains in thin turnover driven mainly by technical factors after three sessions of losses .
In Mexico City , the benchmark index ended slightly lower after traders took profits when the market had surged about 1.5 % early in the session , following Monday 's 1.9 % rally in reaction to the Mexican presidential election outcome .
In Hong Kong , prices plummeted to their lowest levels since July 26 on news of the poorer-than-expected results of the government land auction , an indicator of the health of the British colony 's real estate market in the wake of last week 's boost in interest rates .
A single bidder obtained two sites at the opening offer prices , while a third property failed to attract any interest at all .
On the bourse , the property sector tumbled 3.4 % , while financial shares sank 2.1 % and utilities lost 1.3 % .
In Singapore , stocks fell , as mild profit-taking continued to reduce recent gains ; investors continued to focus on Malaysian over-the-counter stocks .
In Kuala Lumpur , prices were lower to mixed , as the market consolidated after failing to break perceived resistance levels .
In Seoul , equities slumped 1.2 % , pulled down by weakness among large-capitalization shares ; declines were broadly based .
In Taipei , shares fell , as investors took profits after the main index in the previous three sessions had gained about 3.8 % .
In Manila , the market surged 2 % in heavy trading , buoyed by strong buying of blue chips by Philippine and foreign investors .
In Bangkok , the bourse retreated 1.2 % in heavy trading , breaking an eight-session winning streak , as investors grew nervous about the strong gains while other markets had declined ; investors took profits in banking , communications and financial issues .
Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective , Geneva .
To make them directly comparable , each index , calculated in local currencies , is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100 .
The percentage change is since year-end .
Stock prices surged and bond prices inched higher as the dollar stabilized against major currencies .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 24.61 to 3775.83 , snapping a four-session losing streak with its biggest single-day gain since Aug. 1 .
The industrial average shot higher from the opening , climbing more than 40 points before easing late in the session .
The Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index gained 2.19 to 464.51 , and the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 5.69 to 747.98 .
`` With everyone worried about the Federal Reserve 's policy on interest rates , and more recently , the weakness of the dollar , stocks have been unable to move higher , '' said Gail Dudack , market strategist for S.G. Warburg .
`` But with bonds and the dollar stabilizing , stock prices can finally respond to earnings , which have been stronger than expected .
'' Bonds , which have performed weakly in the face of the rickety dollar , steadied following a better-than-expected Treasury auction of $ 17.26 billion in two-year notes .
Today , the Treasury sells $ 11 billion in five-year notes .
`` The stock market is still tied to the bond market , and if the bond market -- and the dollar -- do well , then the stock market will move higher , '' said Byron Wien , investment strategist for Morgan Stanley .
`` There 's a growing feeling now that maybe this bull cycle is n't over .
'' Economically sensitive stocks were buoyed by a sharp rise in Deere , which released robust fiscal third-quarter earnings .
Deere , a farm-equipment maker , jumped 3 5\/8 to 69 5\/8 .
Caterpillar , another machinery concern and a component of the industrial average , climbed 4 3\/8 to 111 5\/8 .
But the stock-market euphoria did little to alleviate lingering concerns about the dollar , which steadied amid renewed optimism about trade talks between the U.S. and Japan and some profit-taking following the currency 's recent slide .
Still , economists noted , the dollar continues to trade below levels held before last week 's credit tightening by the Federal Reserve , despite yesterday 's stabilization .
`` The big fall in the dollar since the Fed tightening has been very disappointing , and it suggests that the dollar 's weakness stems from nonmonetary-policy factors , '' said Mickey D. Levy , chief financial economist for NationsBank .
`` We can expect continued weakness on the dollar as long as trade deficits continue to widen and the current fiscal policy remains unchanged .
'' World-wide , stock prices fell in dollar terms .
The Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.05 to 118.69 .

HENDERSON , N.C. -- A week after the resignation of its president and chief executive , Rose 's Stores Inc. said its chairman is also stepping down .
Lucius H. Harvin III , 55 years old , is relinquishing the helm of the discount retailer effective immediately to `` pursue other interests , '' according to Rose 's .
Mr. Harvin 's resignation follows last week 's departure of President and CEO George L. Jones , who is joining a unit of Time Warner Inc. , New York .
Rose 's named R. Edward Anderson , the retailer 's 44-year-old executive vice president and chief financial officer , to fill the three top positions .
`` It is appropriate for a guy like Anderson to guide a company out of bankruptcy , '' said Kenneth M. Gassman Jr. , an analyst with Davenport & Co. in Richmond , Va. .
Rose 's filed for bankruptcy protection in 1993 , after being battered by widening losses and competition from national rivals such as Kmart Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. `` Ultimately , though , Rose 's is going to need a merchant at the helm , '' Mr. Gassman said .
As part of Rose 's reorganization plan , some of its creditors requested that the chairman , chief executive and president positions be filled by one person , according to Adam Moskowitz , an analyst with B.D.S. Securities Corp. in New York .
DALLAS -- Greyhound Lines Inc. said that its July bus traffic fell by 7.4 % , to 602.7 million revenue passenger miles , from 650.7 million revenue passenger miles a year earlier .
The struggling bus company said its traffic for the first seven months of 1994 was 3.1 billion revenue passenger miles , down 9.2 % from 3.4 billion revenue-passenger miles a year earlier .
A revenue-passenger mile equals one paying passenger traveling one mile .
The declines come amid continued shareholder discontent and management upheaval at the troubled company , which has posted several quarters of disappointing results .
Frank Schmieder , president and chief executive officer , resigned Aug. 9 .
Toronto-based Connor Clark & Co. , an investment concern that holds an 18.3 % Greyhound stake , had sought his ouster , along with three seats on the company 's nine-member board .
On Sunday , Greyhound offered Connor Clark two board seats and a role in picking Mr. Schmieder 's successor , although the Canadian group would have to agree to a number of conditions in return , including not pressing for additional management and board changes .
A Greyhound spokeswoman said the company had not received a response from Connor Clark , whose executives did not return phone calls seeking comment .
SFM Corp. , New York , a maker of electric motors , machine tools and toys , said it will hold a special shareholder meeting Oct. 18 to vote on the proposed reorganization of the company and a 4-for-1 stock split .
SFM said the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective its registration statement relating to the change in format to form a new holding company .
Shareholders will receive three shares of class A stock and one share of class B stock of the new holding company for each SFM share held .
The company said its board set Sept. 14 as the record date for voting eligibility at the meeting , to be held at its Plainfield , N.J. , facility .
STOCKHOLM -- Sweden 's Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken , one of the biggest and oldest banking groups in Scandinavia , returned to operating profit in the first six months of 1994 as loan-loss provisions fell sharply from a year earlier .
SE Banken said it had a six-month operating profit of 2.23 billion kronor -LRB- $ 297.4 million -RRB- , compared with a loss of 298 million kronor a year earlier .
Provisions for realized and anticipated loan losses fell 43 % to 2.96 billion kronor from 5.15 billion kronor , the company said .
Total revenue for the period rose to 9.13 billion kronor from 8.58 billion kronor in the first six months of 1993 , despite a decrease in net interest income to 4.26 billion kronor from 4.58 billion kronor .
BIO-TECHNOLOGY GENERAL Corp. -LRB- Iselin , N.J. -RRB- -- Jane Cahill Pfeiffer , 61 years old , was elected a director of this producer of health-care products , increasing board membership to 13 .
Ms. Pfeiffer , a former chairman of National Broadcasting Co. , has held various positions at International Business Machines Corp. , including director of communications and vice president , communications and government .
Ronald J. Simko , 44 , was named to the newly created post of vice president , manufacturing .
He was formerly senior director , manufacturing and materials management , for Enzon Inc. .
WASHINGTON -- William Bennett , a former education secretary and drug czar , plans to announce today that he wo n't run for the Republican nomination for president in 1996 .
Mr. Bennett , who has assumed a prominent role in the national debate over social and family values , had been urged by many Republicans to wage an unconventional presidential bid .
Though he has n't been an elected official , many backers thought Mr. Bennett 's strongly articulated views on values would strike a chord at a time of rising concerns about the American social fabric .
But a spokesman said that Mr. Bennett has concluded that , while he wants to remain active in politics , `` now is n't the right time for him '' to seek the presidency .
Mr. Bennett , who compiled the bestseller `` The Book of Virtues , '' has speculated that he might be better able to articulate his views outside of a political campaign .
He also has said he dislikes the idea of having to spend much of his time raising money for a campaign .
Had Mr. Bennett decided to run , he would automatically have attracted support from the conservative wing of the Republican Party and among followers of the Christian Coalition .
Mr. Bennett 's withdrawal may help clear the way for the candidacy of Jack Kemp , the former housing secretary who along with Mr. Bennett helps run Empower America , a Republican advocacy organization .
NEW YORK -- The dollar was stronger yesterday , as renewed optimism on U.S.-Japan trade talks fueled a rebound by the U.S. currency .
Traders and analysts said a number of U.S. and Japanese officials helped the dollar with comments indicating the two sides would reach an agreement on Japanese government-procurement practices ahead of a Sept. 30 U.S.-imposed deadline .
The U.S. has threatened to impose sanctions if an agreement is n't reached by then .
`` I do n't intend to go to the U.S. with all my muscles flexed and a fixed agenda , '' said Ryutaro Hashimoto , Japanese trade minister , in comments that were slightly more conciliatory than other recent remarks by Japanese officials .
Mr. Hashimoto is expected to meet Mickey Kantor , U.S. trade representative , in Washington for talks early next month .
On the U.S. side , Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said a breakthrough in the talks is in the mutual interest of the two countries , while U.S. Deputy Commerce Secretary Jeffrey Garten announced that he 'll be meeting his Japanese counterpart to discuss opening Japan 's auto industry to foreign competition .
But the dollar came off its highs late in the day after traders interpreted remarks on the trade talks by influential U.S. economist C. Fred Bergsten as an excuse to sell dollars .
In late afternoon New York trading , the dollar was quoted at 1.5325 marks , up from 1.5278 marks late Tuesday in New York .
The U.S. currency also was changing hands at 97.98 yen , up slightly from 97.85 yen .
Sterling was trading at $ 1.5560 , down a bit from $ 1.5565 .
About noon Wednesday in Tokyo , the dollar was trading at 1.5319 marks and at 97.93 yen ; sterling was at $ 1.5550 .
Though Mr. Bergsten predicted that Japan and the U.S. probably will settle their differences before the Sept. 30 deadline , he also said the dollar may fall below its postwar low of 96.55 yen before then , as a result of the rhetoric that has accompanied the talks .
`` By the end of September we 'll see a negotiated settlement which will defuse the trade tensions , '' Mr. Bergsten said in an interview .
He predicted the dollar will rebound to between 100 and 105 yen during the next 12 months .
He also said Japan 's trade surplus with the U.S. has peaked and is narrowing when measured in yen or in volume terms , though the recent weakening of the dollar is causing it to rise in U.S. currency terms -- the so-called J-curve effect .
`` The adjustment is clearly under way , '' Mr. Bergsten said , adding : `` But it will take time .
'' Despite their optimistic tone , Mr. Bergsten 's remarks `` were all the market needed '' to resume selling dollars , said David DeRosa , director of foreign exchange at Swiss Bank Corp. in New York .
He said traders focused on Mr. Bergsten 's remark about the short-term volatility of the dollar and began to sell the U.S. currency .
Traders said the dollar received a technical boost during Asian trading early yesterday , after it failed to fall below a support level at 97.75 yen , largely on determined dollar-buying by the Bank of Japan .
When it became clear that the support level would hold , traders began buying dollars to cover their short positions , sending it higher against all major currencies , traders said .
Also spurring interest in the dollar yesterday were remarks by Swiss and German central bankers , whose remarks were interpreted by some as indicating that interest rates in those countries may still have room to fall .
In an interview , Markus Lusser , president of Swiss National Bank , rejected the argument of some analysts that recent rate increases in Sweden and Italy signal that the current interest-rate cycle in Europe has bottomed out .
Otmar Issing , chief economist at the Bundesbank , was quoted by an Italian newspaper as saying German inflation and monetary growth are slowing .
WASHINGTON -- The National Association of Securities Dealers , seeking to curb perks for mutual-fund sales , is proposing to restrict gifts that stockbrokers receive from mutual fund companies and insurance firms as an incentive to sell their products .
Under the proposed rules , a broker who sells mutual funds and annuities managed outside his or her firm would be forbidden from receiving cash or noncash gifts of more than $ 100 annually from the investment concern .
Brokers would also be required to maintain records of compensation received in connection with the sale of these securities .
The new rules would prohibit bonuses such as free trips or merchandise that insurance companies and mutual funds give to brokers who sell their funds .
Acceptable gifts would include `` an occasional meal , ticket to a sporting event or theater , or entertainment , '' NASD said .
The proposed rules do n't address above-normal commissions that mutual funds pay brokers to sell a particular fund , said Louis Harvey , president of Dalbar Financial Services in Boston .
COATESVILLE , Pa. -- Lukens Inc. said it would build a $ 57 million annealing and pickling system for stainless steel at its Massillon , Ohio , mill .
Annealing , a heat-treating process , softens steel and makes it more resistant to corrosion and temperatures .
Pickling cleans steel .
The system will make steel coils that will be sold as continuous mill plate , plate-mill plate and hot-rolled sheet .
The project is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1996 , and annual production capacity is expected to be 150,000 tons .
SAN JOSE , Calif. -- Pyramid Technology Corp. , said Munich-based Siemens AG agreed to raise its stake in Pyramid from 5.3 % to as much as 24 % by next year , as part of a licensing agreement .
The computer technology company said Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems , a unit of Siemens , agreed to buy two million shares of Pyramid stock for $ 8.625 a share , which would boost its stake to 17.6 % .
Siemens also gets a warrant to buy an additional 1.3 million shares for $ 10 each , expiring Sept. .
MOLINE , Ill. -- Deere & Co. , citing continued strengthening in North American farm and agricultural-equipment markets , reported a 74 % jump in earnings for its fiscal third quarter on a 14 % rise in sales .
Results for the period ended July 31 topped Wall Street expectations and appeared to brighten the earnings outlook for fiscal 1995 .
Investors reacted by sending Deere shares up $ 3.625 , or 5.5 % , to $ 69.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Volume was very heavy , with 2.1 million shares changing hands .
Deere had net of $ 157.7 million , or $ 1.82 a share , up from restated net of $ 90.8 million , or $ 1.19 a share , for the year-earlier quarter .
Sales at the farm , lawn and industrial equipment maker rose to $ 2.33 billion from $ 2.05 billion .
Pointing to a 9 % increase in agricultural-equipment sales to $ 1.19 billion , Hans W. Becherer , chairman and chief executive officer , said year-to-date North American sales provide a `` sound base '' for operations for the rest of the year .
He added that government forecasts of strong farm income and a plentiful harvest suggest that strong demand will continue through the rest of the year .
Increased construction activity helped spark a 14 % increase in Deere 's industrial-equipment sales , to $ 453 million .
And in a reflection of what Deere called `` continued growth in the general economy , '' North American lawn and grounds-care equipment rose 38 % to $ 332 million .
Profit margins continued to firm in the latest period , bolstered by the efficiencies brought by higher volumes , and by the company 's continued cost-cutting efforts .
Deere 's overseas operations yielded an operating profit , compared with a year-earlier loss , Deere said , attributing the turnaround to higher sales and a recent streamlining of European operations .
While overseas demand for agricultural equipment in 1994 improved in many of Deere 's markets , the company noted that demand in Western Europe remains at `` historically low levels .
'' Sales of agricultural equipment of all kinds have been depressed in Europe as governments there restructure farm subsidies in reaction to recent international-tariff pacts .
The latest quarter 's production would have been even higher if not for the impact of the production startup of a line of large tractors .
With such start-up activities due to be completed in September , Deere said it expects production in the fourth quarter to be up 11 % from the year-earlier quarter .
But it noted that fourth-quarter production of certain vehicles may be hurt by the availability of tires , which remained in tight supply at the end of the quarter .
Suarez Corp. , a direct-mail company that had filed a defamation lawsuit against the writer of an electronic newsletter on the Internet , settled the suit without winning major concessions .
The suit filed against writer Brock Meeks , author of the Cyberwire Dispatch `` newswire , '' was believed to be one of the first U.S. libel cases involving the global computer network known as the Internet .
Mr. Meeks had written a harshly critical article calling Suarez a `` scam '' and charging it had used misleading direct-mail pitches .
Suarez , North Canton , Ohio , had sought damages and an injunction against Mr. Meeks .
The dispute was the subject of an article in The Wall Street Journal last April .
Yesterday , the company settled after Mr. Meeks agreed to pay Suarez 's $ 64 court-filing fee , to fax questions to the company if he writes any articles about it in the next 18 months , and to pay a $ 10,000 fine if he violates the settlement terms .
Mr. Meeks , who ran up legal costs of $ 25,000 defending himself , vows to continue to write his newswire .
Of the settlement , he said , `` I did n't capitulate to anything .
I did n't have to issue an apology .
I did n't have to issue a retraction , and I did n't admit any liability .
'' Benjamin Suarez , president and chief executive of the privately held company , said he settled the case in part because Mr. Meeks had no assets to pay any damages the company might have won .
But he also conceded that he could n't prove Mr. Meeks 's electronic broadside had done any harm to his company .
Indeed , sales of a Suarez book and electronic-mail service went up 15 % in part because of publicity about the case , he said .
`` We kind of feel like we could kiss him , '' Mr. Suarez said of his Internet adversary .
Some lawyers had said a judgment against Mr. Meeks would have a chilling effect on free speech .
Mr. Suarez countered , `` We 're not interested in hurting free speech on the Internet , '' but vowed to sue again if anyone `` misuses '' their First Amendment rights .
`` We 're constantly going to be checking the waters to make sure that we 're not falsely slandered on the Internet , '' he said .
One such check came last week when a Suarez employee , without revealing his company ties , sent out an Internet message asking if anyone knew about the company .
One of the first responses from an Internet user pointed out the employee 's real affiliation .
SAN ANTONIO -- When the Commerce Department last week unveiled new trade data suggesting that Nafta is helping the U.S. economy , it was n't necessarily good news for Robert Velazquez .
As director of the Southwest Trade Adjustment Assistance Center here , Mr. Velazquez makes his living using Commerce Department funds to aid companies in Texas , Oklahoma and Louisiana that have been hurt by imports .
Unfortunately for the program -- and fortunately for the economy -- customers have n't exactly been beating a path to his door lately .
In the past three years , the number of companies certified for help has been cut roughly in half , from 22 in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 , 1992 , to 10 in the first 10 1\/2 months of the current fiscal year .
Even the North American Free Trade Agreement , which on Jan. 1 began eliminating tariffs on goods sold among the U.S. , Mexico and Canada , has n't had much effect so far , despite predictions that U.S. manufacturers would be swamped by cheap Mexican imports .
Not a single one of the 10 companies accepted into the program so far this year has come forward as a result of Nafta , says Mr. Velazquez .
Instead , imports from China and other Asian nations have been much bigger culprits .
Still , that may change .
`` We 're anticipating that , as Nafta comes into full force , we 'll see a lot more clients , '' he says , in his office on the downtown campus of the University of Texas at San Antonio , which administers the program for the Commerce Department .
The center 's survival may depend on it .
The 12 regional trade adjustment assistance centers established around the country have been threatened with elimination in each of the past two budget sessions , as part of the Clinton administration 's effort to trim spending .
Last year , congressional supporters saved the 20-year-old program , but saw its budget cut to $ 10 million from $ 14 million .
To be eligible for assistance , a manufacturer must meet a three-part test : It must show that its sales have declined over the most recent 12-month period ; that its employment level has dropped ; and that imports in its product category are rising .
Once a business has passed through a sometimes lengthy certification process , it receives counseling from a trade adjustment official , who helps the company hire outside contractors to solve specific problems .
Typically , the federal government pays 75 % of the counseling costs and the client pays the rest .
Past projects handled by the Southwest center have run the gamut from oil and gas exploration companies that needed help paying for seismographic surveys to an Oklahoma Indian tribe that received counseling on how to switch from making electric wire harnesses for F-16 jets to making fiber-optic cable .
In the most recent year , the seven-person office has embarked on some unusual rescues .
One involves a Texas maker of dominoes under siege from Chinese competitors .
Mr. Velazquez hopes the company can become more efficient -- perhaps by using an injection-molding machine instead of manually drilling its domino holes one at a time .
Another company that makes a special bib shaped like an elephant faces a threat from cheap knockoffs made by Asian firms ; Mr. Velazquez 's consultants might guide the client into upgrading its computer system or help redesign the work flow to avoid bottlenecks .
One grateful customer is Planto Furniture Manufacturing Co. , a 49-year-old family-owned company in San Antonio that makes office furniture for , among other places , the Texas Legislature .
Two years ago , facing declining sales because of Canadian imports , Planto had laid off a third of its 75 workers .
But after following the consultants ' advice and revamping its catalog to go after national accounts , sales have jumped 25 % , and the work force is at 75 again .
But such stories are becoming increasingly rare .
Although competition from imports is still strong , the region 's economy is doing so well that companies may not notice .
`` Companies are n't feeling the same pressure they were two years ago , '' Mr. Velazquez says .
Still , there 's always Nafta .
Down the hall from Mr. Velazquez , project manager Marilyn Taylor takes a call from a distraught El Pasoan who has just liquidated the apparel operation his grandfather started , due to imports from Mexico .
`` This is really hurting our apparel industry , '' says Dr. Taylor , soothingly .
`` If it 's labor-intensive , it 's on its way out , it 's heading south .
'' The Job Picture : South Texas cities , which last year generated some of the fastest job growth in the nation , appear to be cooling off some , according to new figures from the Texas Employment Commission .
San Antonio , which had average job growth of 4.0 % in 1993 over 1992 , managed just a 2.6 % increase in July .
The McAllen area slipped to 4.6 % in July , compared with a 6.9 % growth rate in all of 1993 , while Victoria 's jobs grew just 1.6 % in July , vs. 3.6 % in 1993 .
WASHINGTON -- The Treasury plans to pay down $ 1.98 billion on the public debt with the sale Monday of about $ 24.4 billion in short-term bills .
Maturing bills outstanding total $ 26.39 billion .
The offering will be divided evenly between 13-week and 26-week bills maturing on Dec. 1 , 1994 , and March 2 , 1995 , respectively .
The Cusip number for the three-month bills is 912794P32 .
The Cusip number for the six-month bills is 912794Q72 .
Noncompetitive tenders for the bills , available in minimum $ 10,000 denominations , must be received by noon EDT Monday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .
Competitive tenders for the bills must be received by 1 p.m. EDT .
The best yields on certificates of deposit may not be around the corner .
While your neighborhood bank or thrift may be offering a full percentage point more on CDs than it was back in January , brokerage firms and banks and thrifts that specialize in taking mail deposits from around the country are offering even more .
A one-year CD from Southern Pacific Thrift & Loan in Los Angeles , for instance , yields 5.81 % , compared with a national average of 4.20 % , according to BanxQuote Money Markets , a Millburn , N.J. , research firm .
At Merrill Lynch & Co. , the big New York brokerage firm , investors can get a one-year bank CD yielding 5.40 % .
Like the CDs at the corner bank , these all carry federal deposit insurance on deposits up to $ 100,000 .
`` As long as you 're insured , I do n't see any reason why you should n't '' go for the best yield , says William G. Brennan , a Washington financial planner .
Brokerage-firm executives say they 're selling more CDs these days , as yields continue to climb and stock and bond prices languish .
There typically are no fees to pay , and the CDs often come from big banks and thrifts around the country .
Brokerage firms are offering an average of 5.11 % on one-year CDs , according to BanxQuote 's weekly survey .
But , at least for now , the highest yields are at a few banks and thrifts that generally have just one or two branches , toll-free telephone numbers and big mail operations .
`` We do n't have the expense of a branch network , so we can pass along the savings to our customers , '' says Lauri Kober , treasurer of First Deposit Corp. , the San Francisco parent of First Deposit National Bank in Tilton , N.H. First Deposit currently offers a one-year CD yielding 5.55 % .
Southern Pacific T&L , which currently has the highest one-year yield listed by BanxQuote , has just two branches .
Because CD yields are set in response to such factors as competition and banks ' need for funds , as well as interest-rate trends in general , they have n't fully reflected the Federal Reserve 's moves to push up short-term interest rates .
Since February , the Fed has increased rates 1.75 percentage points ; meanwhile , average CD yields are up about one percentage point , depending on the maturity .
Some of the institutions offering high yields have big-credit card or other lending businesses .
For instance , First Deposit has another subsidiary , First Deposit National Credit Corp. , in Concord , N.H. , that offers credit cards , revolving credit lines and home-equity loans .
MBNA America Bank in Newark , Del. , which currently offers one-year CDs yielding 5.54 % , is the second-largest credit-card lender in the nation .
These high-yielding CDs sometimes require stiff minimum deposits , however , so it pays to call several institutions before sending a check .
Southern Pacific T&L , for instance , has a $ 5,000 minimum .
First Deposit requires $ 10,000 .
At many banks offering average yields , a depositor with as little as $ 500 or $ 1,000 can buy a CD .
Brokerage firms , which often require a $ 1,000 minimum deposit and typically wo n't accept more than $ 100,000 , can offer higher yields because they negotiate directly with the financial institutions whose CDs they sell , often agreeing to take millions of dollars of certificates .
Brokerage firms are currently offering CDs of such well-known banks as Wachovia , of Winston-Salem , N.C. ; Shawmut National , of Hartford , Conn. ; and Fleet banks , based in Providence , R.I. Brokerage firms got into the CD business in a big way after the stock-market crash of 1987 , when investors were fleeing stocks in droves and looking for a safe place to put their money .
`` In an uncertain time people go back to CDs , '' says William Vulpis of Merrill Lynch .
`` They fill a basic need that a client has .
'' But the brokers ' premium over most bank yields `` wo n't last forever , '' he says .
`` Eventually the banks will catch up .
'' He notes that before the Fed started raising interest rates in February there was very little difference between the yields offered by brokers and by banks .
Investors looking for high yields and safety should n't ignore Treasury securities .
Guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government , they offer yields higher than all but the very highest-yielding CDs , and interest is exempt from state and local income taxes .
A six-month T-bill sold at Monday 's auction , for instance , had a yield of 5.18 % .
High-yield certificates of deposit at financial institutions offering CDs nationwide compared with average yields at some leading brokerage firms .
SAFEGUARD SCIENTIFICS Inc. , Wayne , Pa. , an information-systems company , announced a 2-for-1 split of its 4.7 million common shares .
The company said shareholders of record on Sept. 7 will receive one additional share for each share held .
It said stock certificates will be mailed on Sept. 14 .
The company said it decided to split the stock to increase liquidity and to expand its shareholder base .
The J. Paul Getty Museum 's attempt to import an $ 11.8 million sculpture from London is being hampered by none other than a Getty heir , who is giving money to Britain 's National Heritage department to buy the statue .
John Paul Getty II , son of the late American oil billionaire , last week contributed # 1 million -LRB- $ 1.6 million -RRB- to an effort seeking to prevent an 1814 sculpture by neoclassical Italian artist Antonio Canova , called `` The Three Graces , '' from being shipped to the California art museum founded by Mr. Getty 's father .
The Getty Museum bought the sculpture , a lifesize marble work of three nude daughters of Zeus , in March 1989 from Fine Art & Investment Display Ltd. , a Cayman Islands-based company .
But the museum 's offer is contingent on Britain 's agreeing to grant an export license for the sculpture , which is stored in England .
Under terms of Britain 's national patrimony law , Britain can retain the artwork if it can raise an amount equal to that offered by an outside buyer .
The Victoria and Albert Museum , the National Gallery of Scotland and a toll-free credit-card hotline set up to solicit donations have so far raised # 5.8 million -LRB- $ 9 million -RRB- in the `` Saving Graces Appeal , '' not including Mr. Getty 's pledge .
The nationalists were racing the clock : They had until Aug. 5 to either raise the money or grant the export license .
But the National Heritage department has extended the deadline to Nov. 5 .
The extension , and the donation late last week by the London-based Mr. Getty , has Getty Museum officials crying foul .
Britain 's treatment of the museum , and its efforts to `` change the rules of the game '' has been `` shabby , '' says John Russell , the Getty 's liaison in London .
Mr. Getty could not be reached to comment .
Mr. Getty has a history of patronage to British museums and cultural institutions , and this is the second time that his contributions have prevented the museum founded by his late father from snaring an artwork .
In 1985 he gave $ 530,000 to the Manchester City Art Gallery to keep a painting of the Crucifixion by Siennese master Duccio di Bouninsegna from going to the Getty .
And the matter was complicated further when , last week , a Scottish Museum official was quoted in a BBC interview as saying that `` the crux of the matter '' is that Mr. Getty had never gotten along with his father .
Mr. Getty promptly faxed letters to the National Heritage department and to the museum suggesting that he might withdraw his contribution .
Why is `` The Three Graces '' so important ?
It was n't to Britain back in 1984 , when it turned down the opportunity to obtain it for about $ 1 million from its former owner , the Marquess of Tavistock .
But the threat of its going to the U.S. has become a front-page cause celebre in Britain .
Even with Mr. Getty 's pledge , Britain is still about $ 1.2 million short of the Getty Museum 's offer .
If the money is raised by the deadline , the statue will go on exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London , with an occasional display at the National Gallery of Scotland .
DETROIT -- The United Auto Workers union struck a key General Motors Corp. parts-making plant in Anderson , Ind. , that supplies taillights to most GM assembly plants in North America .
Union officials said the strike was provoked by GM 's efforts to move work currently done by UAW workers in Anderson to lower-wage nonunion contractors outside GM .
`` We 're fighting for our jobs , '' said one union official .
A GM spokesman declined to discuss the issues behind the strike .
`` We ` re still talking to the union , '' he said .
`` We are hopeful a settlement can be reached quickly .
'' The Anderson work stoppage , which involves 3,320 UAW-represented workers , underscores the difficulty GM faces in making its bloated North American operations competitive with leaner rivals such as Ford Motor Co. or the Japanese car makers .
Already this year , GM 's efficiency drive sparked a four-day strike at its Shreveport , La. , assembly plant and a three-day strike at its Dayton , Ohio , parts-making plant .
Unlike an assembly-plant strike , which , at most , affects availability of one or two vehicles , the work stoppage at Anderson has the ability to shut down most of GM 's production within days , union officials say .
GM acknowledges that the Anderson plant supplies `` the vast majority '' of its car and truck factories in North America .
As a result , observers say GM may be inclined to settle the strike quickly even if it has to slow down its cost-cutting campaign at the plant .
The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission is considering new rules designed to encourage polluters to install modern environmental controls on older plants in exchange for less-stringent regulatory oversight .
`` If you let the companies decide their strategy , you may end up with the companies spending less and the state getting bigger reductions in emissions , '' says commission Chairman John Hall .
The commission plans to publish the proposed rules early next month , with public hearings on the proposal tentatively scheduled for late September .
Action on the rules could come in October .
Under the current rules , the commission issues permits for each pollution source -- every boiler , storage tank or catalytic cracking unit within a plant .
The new proposal would allow companies to opt for a single permit for the entire plant or for clusters of equipment within a plant .
So rather than setting pollution restrictions on each piece of polluting equipment , the commission would impose a cap on emissions for the entire plant or for the equipment clusters .
For regulators , the main targets are the scores of older pollution sources that have operated for decades without modern controls or permits because they were in place when the state 's first clean-air law went into effect in September 1971 .
Officials estimate that half to three-quarters of the pollution from refineries in the state comes from these old units .
Companies do n't have to get permits for this equipment -- so long as they do n't change it , or how it 's used , in any way .
Regulators hope that the promise of less regulation will induce the companies to upgrade their equipment -- and bring it under the regulators ' control .
With a `` flexible permit , '' for instance , companies that operate refineries , petrochemical plants and other facilities could change their production methods , or increase production , without having to get permits for each piece of equipment .
And those companies that already have permits could make changes without having to seek a change in their permits -- so long as total emissions remain below the cap .
The proposal has won the support of several refiners , which initially pressed for the change , as well as the Texas Chemical Council , the American Electronics Association and the electric utility trade group .
The agency already has received interest from Texaco Inc. affiliate Star Enterprise .
Star is considering a proposal to cut emissions at its Port Arthur refinery by about 40 % -- some 5,000 tons a year -- if it can replace its 50 existing permits with one or more flexible permits .
The new permits would also cover 20 facilities that now operate without a permit .
Environmentalists applaud any initiative that would bring aging equipment under regulatory oversight .
But some say flexible permitting should n't be available to newer facilities that already have pollution controls , where flexibility could bring increased emissions .
`` There 's no public health benefit to give the flexibility to new facilities , '' says Mary Kelly , executive director for the Texas Center for Policy Studies and a member of a commission task force reviewing the proposed rules .
Commission officials counter that it would n't be fair to penalize the companies that have invested in reducing air emissions while rewarding companies that have n't .
Says Jeff Saitas , director of the commission 's new source review program : `` That 's unfair economic competition .
'' Players of video and computer games will be getting exactly what they asked for this fall : no mercy .
That 's the message from distributors of sequels to two of the most ferocious and most popular games of 1993 .
Despite complaints about sex and violence , the two companies plan even more aggressive marketing campaigns that will reach beyond game magazines to mass-market consumer publications , television and movie theaters .
Acclaim Entertainment , based in Oyster Bay , N.Y. , is investing $ 10 million in a marketing push for the Sept. 9 launch of Mortal Kombat II .
The original version has sold more than six million games since being introduced last September .
The game , in which players rip out the hearts of their enemies , is manufactured for the Nintendo and Sega home systems .
At the same time , GT Interactive Software , a unit of closely held Good Times Entertainment , is readying a $ 3 million to $ 5 million campaign for the launch Oct. 10 of Doom II , a follow-up to Doom , one of the industry 's most successful computer-software titles .
In Doom , a marine has been exiled to a toxic-waste disposal site where he tries to kill an army of demons , former humans and lost souls by blasting them with an arsenal of weapons .
The new games follow on the heels of a recent round of Senate subcommittee hearings on the issue of sex , violence and software games .
As a result of the discussions , the Interactive Digital Software Association , a trade group that represents 12 of the largest video-game makers , has agreed to implement a stringent game-rating system .
The Computer Game Ratings Workings Group , a coalition of six personal-computer software associations , is adopting a separate system .
The size of the advertising budgets for the new games and the fact that Acclaim and GT Interactive Software are reaching beyond traditional game magazines underline the increasingly broad appeal of the software game business .
But critics worry that the new marketing campaigns will give an even higher profile to violent entertainment .
`` Children have a tendency to role-model based on what they see on television , and they will do the same with video and computer games , '' says Nancy Dickey , a family practitioner in Richmond , Texas , and a vice chairman of the board of trustees at the American Medical Association .
Some doctors believe video games are more dangerous than television .
`` These games are even worse than violence on television and in the movies because kids are participating , not simply watching , '' says Carole Lieberman , a psychiatrist in Beverly Hills , Calif. , who specializes in the effect of media on viewers .
`` What bothers me is that the more destructive behavior they exhibit , the more they are rewarded with bells and whistles .
'' Executives at Acclaim and GT strongly disagree .
`` Our obligation is to supply accurate information in terms of advertising and promotion , and then it is up to parents or the consumers , '' says Robert Holmes , Acclaim 's president and chief operating officer .
`` What the critics and the politicians have forgotten is that many of the players are older than 17 .
'' Acclaim is giving Mortal Kombat II the kind of attention lavished on a movie premiere -- and the projected revenue will likely top many of Hollywood 's offerings .
The company has received opening orders for 250,000 games at a wholesale price of about $ 40 each , and sales are expected to top 2.5 million units .
At an average retail price of $ 60 , Mortal Kombat II may gross $ 150 million or more .
The new campaign will feature extensive print and television advertising , as well as a 45-second commercial that is now playing nationwide in two movie theater chains .
At the same time , Acclaim is offering consumers who reserve copies early three free Mortal Kombat II posters .
Separately , New Line Cinema is filming a movie version .
`` What this is about is creating an event , '' says Mr. Holmes .
`` We have n't toned down the violence , either .
Mortal Kombat II has been a hit in the arcades for months , and fans expect the same level of entertainment at home .
'' Doom , introduced last December , was sold through the `` shareware '' method of marketing , in which on-line computer users sampled a shortened version either free or at a low cost and then bought the full game from the game 's developer , ID Software of Mesquite , Texas , for about $ 45 .
There are more than 100,000 registered users .
The game 's sequel , Doom II , has been licensed to GT , which will distribute it through normal retail channels .
Ron Chaimowitz , GT 's executive vice president , says that each box will bear a label advising that players should be 17 years or older .
-LRB- Mortal Kombat II carries a similar warning .
-RRB- `` We 've already got orders to ship 420,000 units world-wide at an average wholesale price of $ 39 , '' says Mr. Chaimowitz .
The company expects to sell at least one million , which at an average retail price of $ 55 , would generate $ 55 million .
GT has already begun promoting Doom II in a variety of game magazines and expects to begin advertising in such general consumer publications as People after the game is distributed .
`` We 're also planning to advertise on MTV , '' says Mr. Chaimowitz .
`` Our audience is mostly 18 and above , so we 're also scheduling a number of college tournaments .
'' Mr. Chaimowitz dismisses complaints that the game is too violent .
`` This is n't going to twist anybody 's mind , '' he says .
`` Video games started by shooting at space ships ; now we 're using 3-D animation to shoot at aliens who can fire back .
It 's clearly a fantasy .
'' GT is even poking a little fun at its critics .
In a print ad for its Doom sequel , the company cites a review of the original game that warns , `` Do n't bother with Doom if on-screen violence sends you screaming to a Senate subcommittee .
'' Bangkok Bank reported a solid 19 % rise in profit in the first half , but the jury is deadlocked over whether Thailand 's largest commercial bank can restructure swiftly enough to keep profit advancing at that pace this year and next .
Some analysts see diminishing returns , as interest margins narrow and lending growth slows .
But others say noninterest income should continue to rise sharply and the mammoth bank 's efforts to diversify already are helping .
Profit totaled 8.32 billion baht -LRB- $ 333 million -RRB- in the first half , up from 6.98 billion baht a year earlier .
Analysts , on average , are expecting the bank to earn about 15.9 billion baht this year , or 16 % more than in 1993 .
NEW YORK -- This city is taking a bite out of the multimedia apple .
During the past two years , such major companies as Hearst Corp. , Viacom Inc. and Bertelsmann AG have launched new media businesses here .
Perhaps even more importantly , a raft of smaller ventures is sprouting , from Music Pen Inc. , a thriving software developer and publisher , to Rap Multimedia Inc. , a Bronx-based start-up company that hopes to publish rap music-related CD-ROM titles as teaching aids .
A multimedia CD-ROM is a compact disk used to deliver digitized information that often includes video , audio and graphic features .
`` We 've always had the music and artistic people , but now we 're attracting the technical personnel as well , '' said Michele DiLorenzo , president of Viacom New Media , a Viacom unit that will issue 17 CD-ROM titles and video cartridge games this year .
`` For the first time , the new media business here is starting to reach a critical mass .
'' Even Microsoft Corp. , the big software company based in Redmond , Wash. , has opened a New York office .
Its sole purpose is to help publishers develop CD-ROM titles .
New York has `` the best storytellers in the world and very creative graphics people , '' said Fredric De Wulf , Microsoft 's manager of new business .
`` The big obstacles are high taxes and rents that make it hard for developing companies to survive .
'' Although Microsoft publishes its own CD-ROM products , the New York office is aiding competitors to encourage the use of its Windows software program .
This morning , for example , one of the first shows devoted entirely to CD-ROM technology , entitled `` CD-ROM Home & Office World ' 94 '' is opening at the New York Hilton .
An estimated 75 exhibitors nationwide are expected to show their latest titles , while as many as 5,000 people are expected to attend the three-day event .
`` We chose New York because it is becoming a hotbed of technology as well as new media , '' said a spokeswoman for Mecklermedia Corp. , Westport , Conn. , which is sponsoring the show .
Not even the city 's biggest , most avid promoters suggest New York will shoulder aside Hollywood and Silicon Valley as a leading provider of new hardware and software .
But for New York , the economic stakes are high .
In 1990 , the latest year for which such statistics are available , more than 18 % of all employees in the U.S. book publishing industry and more than 25 % of all those in the magazine business worked in New York .
Yet a new study issued by Ruth Messinger , Manhattan borough president , warns that advances in desktop publishing will make it easier for start-up companies to establish themselves outside the metropolitan area .
Ms. Messinger may well be right .
Last year , Putnam\/Berkley Group Inc. , a unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. 's MCA Inc. , opened its Putnam New Media division in Reston , Va. , not at Putnam\/Berkley 's headquarters on Madison Avenue .
`` We have phones , faxes and computers , and we 're five minutes from the airport , '' says Stacy Moseley , director of marketing at Putnam New Media .
Many , though , say New York is still the place to be .
In a crowded loft on West 25th Street , publicly traded Byron Preiss Multimedia Inc. is working on CD-ROM titles that range from a comprehensive look at Frank Lloyd Wright to Gahan Wilson 's creepy game for kids titled `` The Ultimate Haunted House .
'' Farther south , the area surrounding Broadway and Houston Street now houses more than a dozen multimedia companies , earning it the nickname `` Multimedia Gulch .
'' And at New York University , an estimated 150 full-time students are studying to earn graduate degrees in multimedia studies .
Hundreds more have signed up for seminars .
Says Olaf Olafsson , president of Sony Electronic Publishing , which plans to open two new multimedia divisions here : `` There 's a take-no-prisoners attitude in New York you do n't find anywhere else .
'' In hopes of nurturing that growth , the New York City Partnership , a nonprofit organization , is assisting a group of multimedia consultants , venture capitalists and media companies to create a media trade association .
Moreover , New York City officials are working on a real estate tax-abatement plan for a lower Manhattan building that would provide low-cost office space to as many as 30 fledgling software companies .
Those close to the project say that if the proposed New York Information Technology Center proves successful , there will be an effort to create a downtown information technology district .
`` We 're in the early stages of building a completely new industry , '' says Mark Stahlman , president of New Media Associates Inc. , a media research and financial services concern .
`` The Microsofts of the late 1990s are likely to be people working in small creative teams who are thinking about inventing new businesses and models and new industries .
That 's the promise of new media , and that 's why New York has a strong claim on being an important geographic center .
'' AUSTIN -- A state Senate committee has proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow Texans to take out general-purpose second-mortgage loans for the first time .
But consumer protections written into the proposed amendment probably do n't go far enough to win over opponents .
The three-member committee , which is circulating a draft of its proposal , last month unanimously recommended that the Legislature submit the issue to voters .
That action , however modest , represented a milestone in the debate over home-equity lending : It marked the first time any legislators have ever voted on the issue in Texas .
But opponents -- a coalition of real-estate brokers , home builders , farmers and consumer groups -- are n't budging .
`` Will there ever be enough safeguards ?
'' says Tom Smith , Southwest regional director for the consumer group Public Citizen .
`` The answer is no. '' Champions of home-equity lending , led by the state 's bankers , are counting on the renewed attention given to the issue this summer , after the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal thrift regulations allowing such loans override the Texas Constitution 's ban on them .
That sparked a dispute in Washington between U.S. Rep. Henry Gonzalez and Sen. Phil Gramm , over an amendment by Rep. Gonzalez to the pending interstate banking bill .
The amendment essentially overruled the appeals panel by declaring that thrift regulators ca n't override the Texas Constitution .
The amendment was adopted by the House and is pending in the Senate ; Sen. Gramm has vowed to remove the amendment , but even supporters do n't think he has much chance of succeeding .
And that puts the issue back on the state Legislature .
The state Senate committee 's proposal , modeled after a plan offered last session by the Texas Bankers Association , contains a number of new consumer safeguards -- tougher than any other states and tougher than new federal requirements recently adopted by Congress .
The protections are designed to answer concerns raised by small businesses , farmers and the elderly .
Like the earlier proposal from the bankers , the latest draft would permit only one home-equity loan on a mortgage ; that would avoid the `` stacking '' of second and third mortgages that is giving borrowers headaches in California .
It would give borrowers a 15-day cooling-off period before loans are completed , and limit the loans to 70 % of a home 's equity .
But it also contains some new features , specifically aimed at addressing concerns raised by opponents .
In response to misgivings among home builders and some small businesses that lenders would require a second mortgage to secure business loans , the proposal prohibits lenders from such `` cross-collateralization '' requirements .
It also bars lenders from calling a loan because of a decrease in the market value of a home -- a provision designed to protect the elderly , who frequently see their property values fall as their houses age or their neighborhoods decline .
And a lender could n't demand repayment simply because the borrower defaults on other debts .
`` We have tried to respond to our opponents and our critics wherever possible , '' says Robert Harris , president of the Texas Bankers Association in Austin .
`` I ca n't think of a state that has anything close to this .
'' -LRB- In fact , no state places more restrictions on home-equity loans , probably because no state adopted anything like Texas ' strict constitutional ban .
-RRB- The measure , however , does n't bar equity loans on agricultural homesteads -- a compromise the bankers ' group was prepared to make last session -- because some farm interests made it clear that inclusion of the provision would n't alter their opposition .
Nor does the proposal limit home-equity loans to specific uses , such as medical or college expenses or reverse annuity mortgages -- the one compromise the lenders have steadfastly refused to make .
`` We do n't think we should continue to tell Texans how to manage their personal assets , '' Mr. Harris says .
Nor has the committee settled on how lenders who violate the prohibitions should be punished .
`` You have to be able to really sock violators with tremendous liability , '' says Susannah Goodman , a lobbyist for Public Citizen in Washington .
While applauding the safeguards , opponents simply do n't trust the lenders ' promises and do n't believe the protections are enough of a defense against unscrupulous operators .
Randy Neugebauer , president of the Lubbock Land Co. and an officer of the Texas Association of Builders , imagines that lenders could get around the ban on cross-collateralization , for instance , by requiring that a borrower 's company get a boost in capital before approving the loan -- without explicitly requiring that the capital come from a home-equity loan .
The North American Free Trade Agreement will lower a host of trade barriers .
But the pact probably wo n't do much to end tensions between Texan and Mexican shrimpers in the Gulf of Mexico .
For one thing , the treaty contains no provision for reciprocal fishing rights .
That might have headed off incidents like the attempted seizure of three Texas shrimp boats in July by a Mexican navy patrol boat off Port Isabel , Texas .
The Coast Guard , which intervened , is investigating .
But then , Texas shrimpers are n't all that eager for open fishing since Nafta also apparently wo n't resolve conflict over the use of `` turtle-excluder devices '' in fishing nets to protect certain rare turtles .
Texas shrimpers say the so-called TEDs , whose use is strictly enforced by the Coast Guard but not by Mexican authorities , reduce their catches as much as 15 % .
To avoid a ban on shrimp exports to the U.S. , Mexico has agreed to phase in TEDs .
But Texas shrimpers say that is n't enough .
They want to know whether enforcement will consist of dockside inspections or at-sea patrolling , a better indicator of whether the devices are being used .
`` We ca n't compete if they do n't have at-sea inspections , '' says Wilma Anderson , executive director of the Texas Shrimp Association .
LIKE A STRUGGLING hitter working out of a slump , President Clinton gets plenty of unsolicited advice these days .
But none is more important than the six-page memo he got a couple of weeks ago from Al From .
Mr. From is president of the Democratic Leadership Council , an organization of centrist or conservative Democrats -LRB- depending on your taste in terminology -RRB- .
Whatever its label , the DLC prides itself on not representing the liberal wing of the Democratic Party that dominates in Congress .
Mr. Clinton was once the DLC 's leader , and that helped convince people in 1992 that he was a `` New Democrat '' with a different philosophy that activist government does n't mean big government .
Today , Mr. Clinton is sliding in public esteem because many Americans have simply stopped believing that he really is a New Democrat .
The slide seems directly linked to the public 's mounting distaste over his giant health-care reform plan .
That 's the bad news for the White House .
The silver lining , in the eyes of some Clinton advisers , is that if Mr. Clinton can only salvage something from the ashes of the health-care debate , he actually has laid the foundation to move on to a New Democrat agenda for the remainder of his term .
In this view , Mr. Clinton 's success in saving the crime bill in the House this week by reaching out to Republicans represents a corner turned .
THAT 'S WHERE Mr. From and his memo come in .
In Mr. From 's view , the president is in trouble because he has looked like just another partisan warrior , standing alongside Democratic congressional leaders as they `` refight the fights of the '80s .
'' Mr. From argues not just for a centrist strategy , but for a new 1990s agenda .
That means focusing on jobs , not in the traditional way but by putting more juice behind an administration initiative to remake training programs for displaced workers .
It means emphasizing anew the administration 's `` reinventing government '' initiative to make the government smaller and sharper .
It means stressing social values , particularly through a big push to overhaul the welfare system .
It means showing more tight-fistedness with taxpayers ' money .
And it means standing up more often to old-line Democrats in Congress , who do n't share this agenda .
`` I 'm not so much saying get in the middle of the two parties on every issue , '' Mr. From says .
`` I 'm saying redefine the fight in his own terms .
'' In fact , the Clinton administration has done some of that .
The problem is that its own Democratic allies in Congress resist .
A prime example is Vice President Al Gore 's reinventing government initiative .
It calls for reducing the civilian federal work force by 252,000 over five years .
But in Congress , lawmakers are quietly undermining that effort by slipping into bills language that shields various agencies from the vice president 's knife .
One bill alone , the Treasury Department 's appropriations bill , would require the Customs Service to employ at least 17,524 full-time employees and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms to employ at least 4,215 full-timers .
IN OTHER CASES , Congress has drained money away from New Democrat initiatives to fund Old Democrat programs .
Mr. From notes that funding for the president 's national service program , in which young people do public-service work in exchange for college tuition , was pared down so much that its three-year budget is now smaller than one year 's cotton subsidy .
White House aides argue that the more important point is that there 's a start toward a New Democrat agenda , with more coming .
Even in its shrunken form , the national service program will have more volunteers than the Peace Corps did at its height .
By backing the new North American and world trade treaties , the administration has put Democrats behind trade liberalization .
Administration aides talk favorably of jolting the education system by backing charter schools , in which teachers and parents are given freedom and funding to launch new public schools .
The earned income tax credit to aid the working poor has laid the groundwork for a big push next year for welfare reform .
And do n't be surprised if the administration begins pushing next year for a Family Tax Credit , which would expand tax breaks for families with kids .
The problem , of course , is that this all could evaporate if the administration does n't head off the very real prospect of disaster in both the health debate and fall elections .
Mr. From 's advice : Accept a health-care compromise , and call a bipartisan summit at Camp David if necessary to get it .
The compromise obviously will fall short of Mr. Clinton 's promise of universal coverage .
But he could explain that away by telling the nation : `` What I ` ve discovered is that the path to universal coverage will take some time .
This is just the beginning of the battle .
'' For Global Marine , the heated drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico is a bittersweet boon .
On the one hand , the increase in drilling has helped pad Global 's bottom line in recent quarters , as more exploration companies search , particularly for natural gas deposits .
However , the drilling frenzy has attracted far more rigs to the waters than demand warrants , and that has pushed down the day rates oil-service contractors such as Global can charge for their rigs .
As a result , analysts are almost evenly split on the prospects for Global 's stock .
According to Zacks Investment Research , a Chicago market-information firm , nine brokerage houses rate the stock a `` buy , '' while 11 label it a `` hold .
'' Such polarization is best illustrated by the two most recently released reports on Global Marine .
In the bulls ' camp , analysts such as Russell Hoffman at Bear Stearns in New York insist the stock `` has tremendous upside potential .
'' In late June , Mr. Hoffman raised Global to `` buy , '' and noted that the company `` is well-positioned to benefit from the forecasted offshore drilling recovery in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and North Sea markets .
'' Mr. Hoffman , in fact , maintains that Global 's stock , currently languishing in the $ 4 range , could reach as high as $ 21 in the next four years .
Skeptics , however , are n't convinced such dramatic price escalation is in Global Marine 's long-range future .
And they argue that current trends in the Gulf of Mexico bode poorly for the company 's near-term outlook .
Indeed , James Stone , oil-services analyst at Werthheim Schroder in New York says , `` I do n't see how you get to $ 21 for Global Marine without a couple of reverse stock splits .
'' Mr. Stone downgraded Global shares to `` hold '' from `` buy '' in a July 13 report , in which he noted that day-rates have n't risen as expected , that natural-gas prices have slumped in the past month and that the supply of rigs parked in the Gulf outstrips the demand .
As such , Mr. Stone says that the most he can see Global selling for is `` maybe $ 10 a share .
And it 's a long , tough road for them to get to that point .
'' To be sure , Global has posted some strong earnings in the past year , and the price of its stock has demonstrated considerable strength , having spurted past $ 5 in the past year after starting 1993 barely above $ 2 .
The company , which sank into bankruptcy after the oil market died in the 1980s , posted second-quarter revenue of $ 76.3 million , 40 % greater than the year-earlier period 's $ 54.5 million .
It posted a loss of $ 800,000 for the latest period , narrowed from $ 11.9 million , or eight cents a share .
Even bearish analysts say Global has done yeoman work in improving its earnings reports and balance sheet , and they say the outlook over the next three years or so is good .
`` But it 's the near-term prospect that is the primary driver of valuation in oil-service stocks such as Global , '' says Arvind Sanger , a Kidder Peabody analyst who rates the shares `` neutral .
'' And the near term , Mr. Sanger says , is n't so bright .
Much of Global Marine 's success revolves around two key ingredients , prices for oil and natural gas and the demand for drilling rigs in the Gulf , where roughly half of Global 's fleet is located .
And right now , those ingredients are showing signs of weakness .
Indeed , Global Marine 's David A. Herasimchuk , a vice president , says that during the spring he was pessimistic on the industry 's outlook because oil prices were down and gas prices were n't high enough to generate the investment capital exploration companies needed to sustain an increase in drilling activity .
Today , he notes , although oil prices have rebounded , gas prices have fallen off .
`` And gas prices generate the cash stream exploration and production companies use to fund their activities '' in the Gulf , Mr. Herasimchuk adds .
Natural-gas prices at the wellhead have slumped in the past month to $ 1.51 for one million British thermal units .
That 's down significantly from the more than $ 2 the same amount fetched this time last year .
High gas prices pump up the cash flow for exploration and production companies ; they in turn spend that cash on more exploration and drilling .
The Wall Street Journal , quoting analysts citing these factors , published a generally favorable forecast for Global in December .
As prices decline , though , so does interest in drilling costly new wells .
Compounding that problem is the fact that the Gulf of Mexico has become the world 's hottest drilling spot .
And that has attracted rigs from the North Sea and West Africa , where exploration has slowed .
The Gulf 's feverish activity also has spurred companies to pull mothballed rigs out of storage .
The cumulative effect over the past year has been that the supply of rigs in the Gulf jumped 16 % , while demand increased just 8 % .
That has forced down the day rates for drilling rigs to levels below what they were a year ago .
`` The weakness in natural-gas prices indicates that the supply-demand balance is n't likely to tighten any time soon , '' says Mr. Sanger .
That means day rates are n't likely to jump much higher in the near term .
`` One day Global Marine might be the greatest thing since sliced bread , '' he says , `` but I would n't recommend waiting for that .
'' Sundowner Offshore Services jumped nearly 19 % to $ 16.625 , and traded at 13.4 times its average daily volume , on news that Nabors Industries , a Houston oil-field services company , has agreed to acquire Sundowner in a stock swap of 2.8 Nabors shares for each Sundowner share .
Nabors stock closed the week at $ 6.375 , meaning Sundowner shares are being valued at about $ 17.85 each .
First USA , a Dallas credit-card processor , gained 10 % to $ 35.75 after CS First Boston initiated coverage of the stock with a `` buy '' rating .
CompUSA surprised analysts by reporting a fourth-quarter loss of 74 cents a share .
Analysts had expected a loss of just one cent .
The resignation of Mervyn Benjet , chief financial officer , compounded the Dallas computer retailer 's woes .
CompUSA 's stock dropped more than 16 % to $ 7 , near its low for the year .
National Convenience Stores , Houston , tumbled nearly 23 % to $ 8.125 after Legg Mason Wood Walker dropped the stock from its recommended list .
Merrill Lynch cut Elcor to near-term `` neutral '' from `` above average , '' following a disappointing earnings report by the Dallas roofing products maker .
Steve Lyle is a computer `` hacker '' in the most literal sense of the word .
Today , for instance , he 's using a power screwdriver to pull apart several filing-cabinet-sized machines that once helped run Kmart Corp. 's cash registers .
`` Sometimes , we find things like dead mice , '' says the cheerful 31-year-old .
But almost everything else -- from steel panels to memory and processing chips -- gets sorted and recycled .
Mr. Lyle 's employer , R. Frazier Inc. of Salem , Va. , is one of a growing band of small businesses that specialize in recycling old computers .
Some of these companies salvage only certain parts , such as circuit boards , or serve mainly as used-equipment brokers .
Others , including Frazier , do it all : Machines like the Kmart relics are torn apart for scrap metal and spare parts , while personal computers , monitors and similar bits of newer hardware are typically reconditioned and resold through distributors .
`` This is a growing business , and it 's going to keep growing along with the computer business itself , '' says Robert Allison , executive vice president and chief operating officer of Aurora Electronics Inc. , an Irvine , Calif. , computer-parts recycler whose revenue last year was $ 79 million .
Indeed , most computer manufacturers as well have set up recycling operations of their own .
The push toward recycling is a natural result of the way computers have penetrated the workplace .
In the past , it was common to make older machines available to those employees who did n't have a computer at their desk or were sharing one with co-workers .
But with computers now ubiquitous in most offices -- and with rapid technological innovation rendering them obsolete much faster -- older equipment increasingly has to be dumped as U.S. businesses replace millions of mainframes , workstations and desktop PCs with newer models .
Christopher Goodhue , research director at Gartner Group Inc. , a consulting firm based in Stamford , Conn. , predicts that 50 million to 70 million PCs alone will have been retired and disposed of between 1992 and 1996 .
`` There 's a boatload of these things going out of service , '' he says , `` and it 's feeding a whole secondary industry .
'' Environmental concerns are also a factor .
`` After a million years or so and a couple of nuclear blasts , old computers are biodegradable in landfills -- but not before then , '' says Michael J. Filandro , president of Houston-based Texas Recycling and Refining Inc. , another small recycler .
Moreover , computers contain dangerous materials , such as heavy metals , that can leach into groundwater from landfills .
Many computer makers , meanwhile , have set up recycling programs at least partly to ensure that proprietary components do n't fall into the wrong hands .
Mr. Allison of Aurora Electronics says the `` open architecture '' of newer computers -- that is , their use of standardized parts -- makes this less crucial .
However , Aurora , a recycler with revenue last year of $ 79 million , will certify the destruction of various components , such as specially designed circuit boards , at a client 's request .
As computers have changed , so has the way they 're recycled .
The big mainframes that once made up the bulk of the business contain large amounts of metal , including gold and platinum , which can be reclaimed for a profit .
The newer PCs , by contrast , contain more plastic , which is far more difficult to salvage .
Mainframes also tend to have more unique electronic components , which stay valuable as replacement parts .
Randy Frazier , a 42-year-old entrepreneur who often talks about computer values in terms of pennies a pound , started his company with four employees in 1988 , a time when computer recycling was still in its infancy .
`` When we knocked on people 's doors back then , '' he recalls , `` they 'd scratch their heads and ask what the heck we were talking about .
They were sending this stuff to landfills .
'' But the idea caught on .
Frazier 's revenue has grown to a projected $ 8 million this year from $ 900,000 its first year .
The company now has 40 employees in the U.S. , a branch in Scotland , and joint ventures in China and Costa Rica .
Mr. Frazier says that in 1992 his company processed nearly 10,000 mainframes ; this year , the total will be only about 3,000 .
As for old PCs , the company reconditions some 300 units a month , but Mr. Frazier says he hopes to expand to 3,000 a month over the next year .
He also notes that of all the material Frazier takes in , only some 3 % by volume gets sent to a dump .
Much of the reconditioned equipment ends up overseas , where consumers are less demanding about having the very latest technology .
`` An old PC has limited value here , but you can sell it easily in a place like Costa Rica , '' says Mr. Frazier .
Finding a steady supply of the right kind of equipment has been tough .
Frazier 's business exploded in 1991 , after Mr. Frazier signed a contract to take truckloads of old and surplus equipment from computer giant International Business Machines Corp. .
Before long , IBM was accounting for 90 % of Frazier 's business .
Eventually , though , IBM set up its own recycling program and stopped sending surplus equipment to any outside vendors -- a move it says has saved the company `` millions of dollars .
'' These days , Mr. Frazier gets most of his equipment from computer-maintenance companies , which install or repair the machines for large corporations and government agencies .
One client , for instance , is installing new PCs for the Justice Department -LRB- to be used in managing its witness-protection program -RRB- and is shipping the old machines to Frazier for reconditioning .
The old PCs are in fairly good shape , says Mr. Frazier , although the memory devices have been exposed to powerful magnets to make sure they 're completely erased .
The economics of the business remain simple .
Leading the way through his factory , Mr. Frazier points to a stack of used color monitors .
Each costs Frazier about $ 50 in the U.S. , he explains , but he plans to resell them in Costa Rica for about $ 85 .
Similarly , he profits by selling reconditioned computers in the U.S. .
He says he spends about $ 90 for the old PCs , refurbishes them , and then sells them to distributors for about $ 165 .
`` As long as I can find value , '' says Mr. Frazier , `` I 'll keep doing it .
'' MONTREAL -- North American newsprint producers , having finally raised prices back to break-even levels , are pushing for further increases -- a move that could trim newspapers ' profits next year .
Several paper makers have notified publishers they intend to raise newsprint prices by as much as 10 % in December .
The move , on the heels of a price increase implemented last week , would raise the rate paid by the biggest publishers to around $ 548 a metric ton -- 33 % above the low point of $ 411 reached early this year , and 22 % above last year 's average of about $ 451 a metric ton .
Some publishing executives contend that the scheduled December increase is premature and wo n't stick if the U.S. economy or overseas demand slackens .
Others warn the increase may stick , but could cripple some struggling newspapers .
But forest-product companies scoff at suggestions that they 're trying to ratchet prices up too quickly .
`` I do n't think it 's ever too soon to be making money , '' says Robert Tait , investor relations officer for Abitibi-Price Inc. `` We have n't been .
'' Newsprint makers say the current price of $ 500 a metric ton is about the rate at which many mills break even , but is well short of levels needed to generate a satisfactory return on assets .
Losses by newsprint makers during the past three years `` have been absolutely massive , certainly worse than anything since the 1930s , '' says Ross Hay-Roe , a principal with Equity Research Associates in Vancouver , British Columbia .
`` For these companies to fix up their balance sheets , they 've got to push prices higher .
'' Mr. Hay-Roe , whose firm provides research to institutional investors and the paper industry , says he believes prices could reach $ 600 a metric ton by the end of 1995 .
That level was last seen in 1988 , before declining U.S. consumption caused the market to crumble .
Among the factors behind North American newsprint makers ' new-found pricing leverage : operating rates that have approached full capacity , reduced inventories , strong overseas demand , and a reported 4.9 % increase in newsprint consumption by U.S. daily newspapers during the first six months of the year .
Newsprint is one of several paper products that have begun to show signs of a sustained cyclical recovery .
Prices for pulp , from which paper is made , have shot up even more sharply than newsprint .
Prices for linerboard , used in corrugated boxes , have risen by more than 30 % since late last year , with further increases slated .
`` Generally , if supply and demand are tight enough to get one price increase at this stage of the cycle , they 're tight enough to get repeated price increases , '' says Matthew Berler , forest-products analyst for Morgan Stanley .
Mr. Berler figures there 's a 70 % chance the December newsprint increase will go through .
The 30 % chance that it wo n't hinges on European markets , where the start-up of three newsprint machines this year could reduce demand for imports from North America , he says .
If the December increase does go through , newsprint prices could get back to the 1988 peak level by the end of next year but are n't likely to go much higher , Mr. Berler says .
That would mean lower returns for newsprint makers than in the past , taking into account inflation since 1988 .
One reason for this scenario , shared by some other analysts : As prices rise , some machines that were shut during the industry 's slump are likely to be brought back to operation .
This would gradually expand capacity and damp further price increases .
That may be cold comfort for some publishers .
Newsprint typically accounts for 20 % or more of newspapers ' costs , so rising newsprint prices can quickly eat into profits .
A December newsprint price increase `` will severely damage some papers , '' says Dick Wallace , vice president of corporate affairs for Freedom Communications Inc. , which publishes the Orange County Register .
With newspapers in some U.S. cities already struggling , `` within the next 24 months , some papers will fold , '' Mr. Wallace predicts .
Still , for most major publishers , the effects would be manageable .
Lauren Fine , publishing-industry analyst for Merrill Lynch , calculates that an increase of 15 % in average newsprint prices would trim earnings per share at publicly traded newspaper companies 1 % to 10 % .
This would generally mean slower growth , rather than outright declines in operating income , she adds .
Companies with extensive nonnewspaper operations would be least affected .
So far , at least a half-dozen newsprint makers , accounting for about 45 % of North American capacity , have notified publishers of planned price increases for December or January .
These include Canadian makers Abitibi-Price , Avenor Inc. , Stone-Consolidated Corp. and Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd. , and U.S. makers Champion International Corp. and Jefferson Smurfit Corp. .
Some publishing executives say there are reasons to believe newsprint makers might retreat from a December increase .
For one , some contend the Newspaper Association of America may have overestimated U.S. dailies ' newsprint consumption during the first half of this year .
The association reported a 4.9 % increase , but Homer Taylor , vice president\/supply for Knight-Ridder Inc. , says newsprint use by his company and several other big U.S. chains rose less than 2 % during the period .
These big users `` ca n't figure out for the world how the total could be up 5 % , if we ` re not part of it , '' Mr. Taylor says .
-LRB- Eric Wolferman , senior vice president of technology at the association , says the statistics are being reviewed for possible anomalies .
-RRB- In addition , fears of a possible strike by pulp and paper workers in British Columbia may have caused some buyers to try to ensure supplies .
So demand could ease if labor contracts are renegotiated without major disruptions , some observers say .
Others hope that rising domestic prices will cause producers to curtail exports and sell more in North America , putting a lid on further price increases here .
But newsprint producers feel pricing momentum has swung clearly to their side .
An Avenor spokesman says that , even allowing for a decrease in offshore shipments in coming months , mills are expected to keep running at close to full capacity .
And if there is a strike in British Columbia , he adds , the main problem will be keeping customers supplied , not raising prices .
The Clinton administration has left the immunization system of America in a shambles .
In 1993 , the administration proposed the Vaccine for Children program , an overhaul of the way vaccines are delivered to children .
But the plan has proved unworkable , and this week the administration announced it is scrapping plans for a government vaccine warehouse .
Meanwhile , few states now know how much vaccine will be delivered , who will deliver it , who will receive it , and who will pay for it , and the White House still ca n't give state health agencies a straight answer .
As Sen. Dale Bumpers -LRB- D. , Ark. -RRB- noted , `` A fairly simple law designed to benefit a relatively small group of uninsured children was transformed into a bureaucratic nightmare .
'' This is all embarrassing to the administration because the Clintonites themselves had boasted that the vaccine program was to be a `` dress rehearsal '' for full-fledged health care reform .
Administration allies such as the Children 's Defense Fund insisted that the vaccine plan would be easy to implement .
As it happens , the Vaccine for Children program mirrors health care reform even more closely than intended .
The program was never really meant to be a specific solution to a simple problem .
It was always envisioned as a symbol of President Clinton 's commitment to social change and willingness to take on special interests who might stand in the way .
As Bob Woodward 's book `` The Agenda '' shows , Hillary Clinton went after vaccine companies because she believed that an assault on private companies pursuing `` profits at the expense of children '' would underscore just how noble the Clintons ' campaign for health care reform would be .
Support from such organizations as the Children 's Defense Fund , it was thought , would establish the moral imperative of their shared vision .
Even the administration 's retreat from its unworkable plan has been instructive .
It is dropping controversial aspects of the plan as a way to preserve the core ideas that are the root of its unworkability .
Just as health alliances were eliminated from the Clinton plan because they harmed the plan 's political chances , the Department of Health and Human Services is getting rid of the vaccine warehouse to ensure the immunization plan 's survival .
Indeed , the recent `` concession '' of scrapping the warehouse does not correct the Vaccine for Children program 's serious deficiencies .
Much like the Health Security Act , Vaccine for Children ignores the needs and efforts of individuals and organizations who make immunization efforts successful and caters to a small group of interest groups and White House staffers more concerned with political messages than real solutions .
The real problem with the Vaccine for Children program was , from the start , the willingness of the Clintons and their allies to rewrite and distort the immunization `` problem '' to fit its more far-reaching ideology .
For example , the administration still justifies its overhaul of the vaccine delivery system by arguing that immunization rates are low because vaccine prices are too high .
Yet as the General Accounting Office study of the Vaccine for Children program concludes , `` vaccine cost is not an important barrier ... It is unlikely that VFC will boost coverage .
'' Indeed , as vaccine prices have increased , so too have vaccination levels .
In 1986 -LRB- before price increases and the addition of two new vaccines -RRB- , immunization rates were about 60 % .
Yet today , using the measure created by HHS 's own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 90 % of all children get their DPT -LRB- diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus -RRB- shots , 86 % receive measles shots and 80 % receive all their polio shots .
Such progress has been brought about without price controls , without federal mandates and without the creation of new government agencies .
Scores of local program managers -- working in cooperation with the CDC , motivated parents and providers -- have contributed to a rise in immunization rates over the decade .
As Martin Levin notes in `` Making Government Work , '' most successful government programs encourage the sort of entrepreneurial activity that has characterized America 's immunization success .
According to congressional sources , the administration will probably agree , as it has on so many issues , to major revisions to save face and save the program .
But only in Washington would saving a program that was n't needed in the first place be deemed a `` compromise .
'' For even though a stripped-down Vaccine for Children program would limit the number of people covered by the program , its principles and practices would remain intact .
The government would still impose a single-payer system on an already effective private sector effort .
It would still dictate the amount of vaccine to be produced and delivered for many children .
It would still slap price controls on the vaccine industry .
The only difference , as proposed by some at HHS , is that the administration will replace one federal warehouse with 25 publicly run warehouses , if it can get away with it .
The preoccupation with warehousing has obscured the real problems with the program 's premise .
The Clinton administration will be willing to defer on where to store vaccine , but it is still committed to nationalizing the vaccine industry .
In its dress rehearsal for health care reform , the administration has managed to make our immunization system more complicated , less efficient and less able to sustain progress in improving vaccination rates .
And it is for this reason that the administration 's fight to save the Vaccine for Children program should continue to raise significant public concern .
Mr. Goldberg is a research fellow at Brandeis University 's Gordon Center .
Coles Myer Ltd. , an Australian retailer , said an independent adviser has concluded the terms of Coles Myer 's proposed buyback of shares from Kmart Corp. of Troy , Mich. , are `` fair and reasonable .
'' It said the independent adviser , KPMG Corporate Finance , has valued each Coles Myer share at between 4.65 Australian dollars and 5.10 Australian dollars -LRB- US$ 3.42 - $ 3.75 -RRB- .
Coles Myer is proposing to buy back a 21.45 % stake from Kmart at A$ 4.55 a share , valuing the share parcel at A$ 1.26 billion .
Coles Myer announced on July 21 that it would buy and subsequently cancel around half of Kmart 's stake at a cost of A$ 587 million .
It initially proposed that the remaining 147 million shares be bought by trading house Barclays de Zoete Wedd Australia Ltd. , which would then place them with investors .
But in its statement , Coles Myer said it is still `` actively considering '' a number of proposals for the shares , including buying them itself .
WASHINGTON -- Call it the Dumbo paradigm .
In the children 's classic , Dumbo is an elephant who can fly , but he thinks he needs the encouragement of a `` magic '' feather to get off the ground .
Eventually , Dumbo learns to fly by himself , without the feather .
In government , the Clinton administration -- with a strategy that Vice President Al Gore compares to Dumbo 's feather -- is encouraging cities to rebuild themselves by dangling the prospect of grants of as much as $ 100 million .
And although the decision is months away on which communities will get `` empowerment zones , '' benefits from the program already are starting to flow .
In Louisville , Ky. , local businesses pledged $ 6.5 million to start a community development bank as part of the city 's application for a zone .
But the bank 's loans to poor neighborhoods will be made regardless of whether Louisville gets the federal grant .
The same is true in Detroit , where the city has pledged to locate three new health clinics in the economically depressed parts of town that are targeted for empowerment-zone status .
Across the country -- from Chicago to Monroe , La. -- the elaborate efforts needed merely to apply for the funds have created many small and some large advances for the communities involved .
As a result , the empowerment-zone program is one of the few concrete examples of how government can instigate change without directly spending a dime -- an oft-stated although rarely achieved goal of the Clinton administration .
`` It 's happening as we hoped for , '' crows Gene Sperling , a White House aide who helped develop the program , which Congress passed last year .
Not everyone is so pleased with the program , which will cost a total of about $ 3.5 billion over five years .
Some Republicans dislike its outright grants , preferring the exclusive use of more-flexible tax incentives like their previous proposals for enterprise zones .
Others dismiss the program as too small to do much good : Only a few communities actually will get grants , and the amount of money , although large , is tiny compared with the problems .
The program will create `` empowerment zones '' in low-income neighborhoods scattered in six urban and three rural areas around the country .
The locations selected will be treated to a huge infusion of federal largess -- a total of more than $ 2 billion in tax incentives in addition to $ 100 million in grants to each urban zone and $ 40 million to each rural area .
The plan also will create 60 urban and 35 rural `` enterprise communities , '' which will get grants of as much as $ 3 million each .
From the start , the empowerment-zone effort was designed to compel communities to improve themselves no matter what the outcome of the enterprise-zone selection process .
Towns and cities have to compete for the federal money by showing how well their citizens already are working together to improve their lot .
The places that show the most initiative presumably will get the nod .
According to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros , 100 federal employees from several government agencies will choose the winners by year end .
The scramble to qualify for this bonanza produced applications from no fewer than 519 communities .
Monroe , La. 's bid was five feet thick .
Memphis , Tenn. 's came with a treasure chest filled with chocolate doubloons .
Baltimore 's was delivered with the help of a high-school band .
The rush for federal gold also produced something more -- a lot of help for poor people along the way .
And that , Vice President Gore says , `` has been a very powerful reaction .
Lots of mayors have called to say that they feel as if they have already come out way ahead just by coming through this process .
'' Take St. Louis .
Major corporations there have pledged to hire more than 3,000 residents in the targeted neighborhoods over the next 10 years .
Local businesses and government agencies also have promised to spend $ 330 million over the same period on projects in the zone .
For example , one public-relations company has donated $ 100,000 in services over the period to help inform community residents about the many new benefits they are getting .
And most importantly , says Scott Intagliata , special assistant to the mayor : `` All of the commitments given to the empowerment-zone application were given based on the understanding that we may never get the $ 100 million .
'' Chicago is another success story .
The mere specter of winning a $ 100 million federal grant spurred the banking community to commit to making $ 100 million in loans on its own for the construction of low-income housing in the designated areas .
Some of the banks also say they will open their first branch offices in the troubled neighborhoods .
In Chicago as elsewhere , the application process also has left the city with something less tangible yet valuable : a new openness among the often-warring citizens groups that work in these hardpressed areas .
`` The process is the best product , '' says Rosanna Marquez , director of programs for Mayor Richard Daley .
`` We sat down from the beginning with the communities that need the help .
'' `` Barriers have been broken down between whites and blacks , among units of local government , and between the public sector and the private sector , '' says Michael Allan Wolf , a professor of law and history at the University of Richmond .
`` These were precisely the kinds of actions that Congress and the Clinton administration were looking for .
'' `` The genie is out of the bottle , '' agrees Mayor Jerry Abramson of Louisville .
`` We will never develop a neighborhood or work on a community-development project the same way again .
This empowerment-zone process will be the norm for doing business in Louisville from now on .
'' Not every community was so diligent about its application .
Officials say some failed to take the time required to shape cooperative ventures or to make the sacrifices called for in the application process .
A few towns have been criticized for doing little more than hiring consultants familiar with what the federal government wanted and drafting a slick document .
Moreover , the $ 100 million grant , while a lot of money in isolation , is hardly enough to solve the huge problems of the nation 's urban centers .
`` That much money will not revitalize even one block in the inner city , '' Mr. Wolf says .
All of which makes the advances along the way that much more consequential .
Phoenix expects to provide tax breaks to help construct a commercial park near its airport .
And Detroit expects its auto makers and other businesses to begin providing job-training to poorer neighborhoods regardless of whether it gets a zone designation .
It was during a White House meeting early on that Vice President Gore likened this type of progress to the story of Dumbo 's feather .
After hearing this explanation , Robert Rubin , the president 's national economic adviser and a former Wall Street investment banker , asked , `` Who is Dumbo ?
'' Mr. Gore has since given Mr. Rubin a copy of the story .
FRANKFURT -- Stock prices for German car makers declined on hints that the European auto industry 's recovery could be stalling out .
But analysts said the sell-off was overdone and a modest recovery remains on track .
Ferdinand Piech , chairman of Volkswagen AG , triggered the sell-off when he publicly predicted that Western European car sales would stagnate this year .
The bearishness was reinforced by Germany 's Motor Vehicles Office , which yesterday reported that new-car registrations in July plunged 16.3 % from June and were down 4.9 % from a year earlier .
In Frankfurt trading , VW shares plunged 21.50 marks , or 4.3 % , to 483 marks -LRB- $ 316.22 -RRB- .
Daimler-Benz AG , which owns luxury-car maker Mercedes-Benz AG , lost 11.50 marks , or 1.4 % , to close at 786 marks , and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG shed 14 marks , or 1.7 % , to 803 marks .
Speaking in Paris , Mr. Piech disclosed that July 's groupwide orders -- a leading indicator for sales -- were merely even with last year 's poor month .
He also suggested that the situation will worsen in coming months , based on company surveys of potential buyers .
Earlier in the year , the year-on-year comparisons had consistently shown comfortable gains .
`` He very clearly stepped on the brake '' to counter the euphoria that had emerged about the state of the auto industry , said Hans-Peter Blechinger , a VW spokesman .
But at the same time , Mr. Piech repeated his forecast that VW will break even this year .
Analysts , some of whom were perplexed at Mr. Piech 's comments , urged traders and investors to keep the faith .
`` We are looking for the Western European market to recover by 6.4 % this year , '' said Arthur Maher , industry analyst at DRI McGraw Hill in London .
BMW suggested that problems might be limited to `` mass producers , '' such as VW .
It said both its German and worldwide orders , production and sales last month exceeded those of a year earlier .
The drop in German car registrations in July also should be seen in perspective , analysts said .
`` One month 's figures do n't provide any reason to talk about a collapse , '' said Georg Stuerzer , an automobile-sector analyst with Bayerische Vereinsbank AG in Munich .
July 's data can be skewed easily by the start of vacations in Germany 's largest states and by the month 's heat wave , which kept consumers out of stores , concurred Juergen Pieper , who follows the industry for DB Research GmbH , a unit of Germany 's Deutsche Bank AG .
Many doctors who treat women with breast implants for a range of painful and debilitating ailments are highly critical of two recent studies that were described as giving silicone implants a clean bill of health .
The studies were widely reported .
The fact that one of them was funded by a plastic surgeons group and implant manufacturers was not .
Moreover , some physicians say that the studies ignored several serious health conditions that are caused by implants .
And they question the significance and methodology of the research .
`` Once you see these women , that 's all it takes to be convinced silicone implants can make them sick , '' says Steven R. Weiner , associate professor of medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles .
`` There 's no one who has seen a large number of these women who disagrees .
We 're talking about somebody with a rockhard mass sitting in the middle of their chest , under their collar bones , under their arm .
'' Excruciating neck , chest and arm pain , and migraine-like headaches are among the conditions that Norman D. Anderson , a Johns Hopkins University medical professor , says he sees among women with breast implants , sales of which have recently been severely restricted in the U.S. They 're allowed only for reconstructive reasons or as part of a clinical trial .
Hard tissue can develop around the implant , and these pains `` always '' develop on the side where the hard mass is located , Dr. Anderson says .
Symptoms subside in a majority of cases when implants are removed , he adds .
These and other physicians say the studies did n't look at these localized conditions .
What the studies did look at were certain `` connective tissue '' illnesses , including scleroderma , rheumatoid arthritis and others .
One study , done at the University of Michigan and funded by Dow Corning Corp. , a onetime implant manufacturer , found no link between implants and the immune-system disease scleroderma , a potentially fatal illness that involves a hardening of the skin and internal organs .
The authors of the second study , Mayo Clinic doctors who published their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine , concluded , `` We found no association between breast implants and the connectivetissue diseases and other disorders that were studied .
'' Because of the reputation of both the clinic and the journal , this study received considerable press .
The study , however , was not based on evidence gleaned from doctors examining patients for the connective-tissue diseases at issue .
It was based on nurses ' reviews of the medical charts of implant and nonimplant patients for connective-tissue diseases , which affect joints and tendons , among other tissues .
The lead author of the Mayo study declined to be interviewed , and the Mayo Clinic itself declined to comment .
John E. Woods , a coauthor of the study who performed many implant operations at the Mayo Clinic , says that the pain that accompanies hard-tissue formation around silicone implants is `` very uncomfortable , but not a health problem .
'' He adds that he 's seen few examples of potential connective-tissue illness among the 2,000 women in whom he installed implants and continues to be `` very positive '' about the devices .
The Mayo research was partly funded by the `` Plastic Surgery Educational Foundation , '' the published article said .
This group is a branch of the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons , a group that has been given several hundred thousand dollars for research by implant manufacturers Dow Corning , Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and others .
The plastic surgeons group says it had no control over the Mayo study 's results .
The major implant makers recently proposed a $ 4.25 billion settlement to be paid to women with disorders allegedly related to implants .
A federal judge , Sam C. Pointer , Jr. , in Birmingham , Ala. , has delayed ruling on the settlement until Sept. 1 to decide whether it is fair to foreign women in particular .
Several doctors raise statistical concerns about both studies , contending the studies were n't even conclusive about the diseases at issue .
Some contended that women with implants would have to be studied for at least 10 years for illnesses to appear .
Epidemiologist David Schottenfeld , who conducted the Michigan study of 377 women , says , `` One study does n't make for a convincing answer .
But it is n't only our group .
It 's also studies at Mayo , Johns Hopkins , an Australian study .
They 're coming to the same conclusion '' that scleroderma is n't necessarily linked to silicone .
But he says that while his work may rule out a tripled or perhaps doubled risk , it does n't discount a smaller one .
Dr. Schottenfeld also says he `` ca n't rule out '' a silicone link to `` atypical '' illnesses , which many specialists say they have observed in women with implants .
The Mayo research , too , has statistical limits .
It compared 749 women with implants in Olmsted County , Minn. , for a mean time of 7.8 years , with 1,498 women in the county without the devices .
Virtually all of the women with implants received them at the Mayo Clinic , Dr. Woods said .
Five patients with implants were reported to suffer certain `` connective-tissue '' diseases .
Ten women without implants had the diseases .
But one passage in the study , which did n't receive a lot of attention , said , `` We had limited power to detect an increased risk of rare connective-tissue diseases , such as systemic sclerosis -LRB- severe scleroderma -RRB- .
Indeed , we calculated that it would require a sample of 62,000 women with implants and 124,000 women without implants , followed for an average of 10 years each , for a doubling of the relative risk of this condition to be detected .
'' Doctors critical of the findings argue that the two groups in the Mayo study are n't comparable .
They say women who get cosmetic implants are prescreened for good health , while many in the control group , selected because they underwent a medical evaluation in Olmsted County , were women who probably went to a doctor because they were sick .
In a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine , six doctors highlighted one Mayo-study finding about local complications that was n't much publicized .
`` Out of 749 women followed for a mean of 7.8 years , '' the authors wrote , `` there were 257 surgical revisions performed , suggesting an implant failure rate in excess of 30 % .
'' Marcia Angell , executive editor of the New England Journal , agrees that some of the criticism of the Mayo study is `` reasonable .
'' Dr. Angell adds , though , that `` while it 's a relatively small study , it 's the best we have .
Any association between silicone implants and these diseases is not likely to be very big .
'' Doctors who have treated women with implants , though , stress that such epidemiological , or statistical , studies are intriguing and perhaps significant , but must be placed in context .
`` I 've been treating these women since 1981 , before the lawyers showed up , '' says UCLA 's Dr. Weiner .
`` All the epidemiology in the world does n't make the patients go away .
'' According to the Yellow Pages directory in Martinsville , Ind. , First National Bank offers customers a little something extra .
And it 's not a free toaster .
Last year , when it merged with another bank , First National had to change its toll-free telephone number .
The 800 number , which lets people call the bank for no charge , is key in attracting rural , Midwestern customers .
But when new phone books came out , they still featured the bank 's old telephone number , which had been reassigned to an adult hot line .
Instead of hearing a cheery bank representative , callers have gotten a recording of two sultry-voiced women urging them to chat for $ 3.99 a minute .
`` We know what you want , '' they whisper , `` and we 're going to give it to you .
So call us right now .
'' It was n't long before bank customers began complaining .
Tom Gillam , First National 's vice president , says he 's `` obviously upset '' with the problem , and has even been chided about it by friends .
`` I can hardly stand to open up the phone book , '' he says .
Worse , when the Indianapolis Star printed the bank 's real number , more than 200 residents called the bank thinking they were calling the erotic hot line .
First National 's receptionist , Sherrell Perkins , says the phones were the busiest she can remember in 20 years .
People would call , giggle and hang up .
`` It was kind of a pain in the neck , '' she says .
A spokeswoman for Ameritech explains that the bank 's 800 number was reassigned too quickly .
Normally , 800 numbers are given a `` cool-off '' period before being resold .
A spokeswoman for E-Tel Inc. , which connects callers to the adult hot line , laughs hysterically when informed about the problems in Martinsville .
`` It happens , '' she says , catching her breath , `` but we have no comment .
'' New Indiana phone books are due out in October , and should feature the correct toll-free number .
In the meantime , Ameritech last week blocked access to the adult hot line for callers in the central Indiana area code .
A relieved Mr. Gillam says , `` We 'd kind of like to push the whole thing under the rug .
'' That may be hard to do , though , as Martinsville is still abuzz with talk of the blunder .
Paula Stewart , who runs the Delite Beauty Salon , says customers gossip about it during the day .
Don Busick , owner of the local Waffle House , says , `` What can you say ?
There are some perverted people down here .
'' A Dallas company is trying to take a bite out of the $ 1.6 billion U.S. chewing-tobacco market with a new nicotine-free herbal snuff .
Smokey Mountain Chew Inc. recently began putting the product on store shelves after a promising test around Tyler .
It says its snuff , made from red clover blossoms , lets users avoid the risk of oral cancers linked to tobacco-based snuff .
The company is focusing its distribution on Texas , Arkansas and Oklahoma , places that principal owner Phil Bidwell calls the `` bread-and-butter dipping states .
'' Marketing efforts target 18 - to 34-year-old `` recreational dippers '' and regular users trying to wean themselves from tobacco-based snuff , Mr. Bidwell says .
The herbal chew comes in two flavors , classic and wintergreen , and is packaged in traditional one-ounce cans .
`` We wanted to keep the macho theme , '' Mr. Bidwell says .
`` We do n't want to be construed as a candy .
'' Just in case there 's any doubt , the company signed Randy White , the hulking former Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle -- and a reformed snuff dipper -- to promote the product .
But Smokey Mountain may have a ways to go to persuade real cowboys to make the switch .
In an unscientific taste test at the Mesquite Championship Rodeo , five cowboys -LRB- and one clown -RRB- give mixed reviews .
`` This tastes pretty nasty , '' exclaims Chris Osborne , a 23-year-old bullrider from Stockdale , after inserting a pinch of the Smokey Mountain classic flavor .
`` If I quit , I 'm going to quit completely , no substitute -- especially not that .
'' Others are more charitable .
`` It kind of tastes like butter , '' says 32-year-old Pete Carr , a Dallas bareback rider who has been dipping snuff since he was 14 .
And Shawn Elmore , a 25-year-old bareback rider from Paris , suggests a possible advantage of Smokey Mountain over traditional brands : `` You can swallow it .
'' Petrie Stores Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to sell its retailing operations to a group of investors and managers for $ 190 million .
As previously reported , when an initial agreement was announced in June , the purchasers include Verna Gibson , a former executive of Limited Inc. credited with turning the company 's flagship Limited chain into a success in the 1970s .
The group also includes Petrie 's president and chief executive officer , Allan Laufgraben , and its chief operating officer , Peter Left .
Financial services firm E.M. Warburg , Pincus & Co. is leading the investor group .
The sale is part of a complicated plan to dissolve Petrie 's retailing business and distribute its 14 % stake in Toys `` R '' Us Inc. to shareholders .
Petrie , which operates 1,700 women 's clothing stores , has long been the largest Toys `` R '' Us shareholder .
The accord allows Petrie 's 92-year-old founder and majority shareholder , Milton Petrie , to liquidate the company without generating a massive tax bill .
The stores , which include moderate-price women 's apparel chains such as Marianne , Stuarts , G&G , Jean Nicole , Rave and Winkleman 's , had been expected to go for as much as $ 250 million .
Although the face value of the agreed-upon accord is lower , it has about the same value because the purchasers are also assuming certain tax , pension and other liabilities , said Gilbert W. Harrison , chairman of Financo Inc. , a New York investment banking firm advising the buyout group .
The amount was n't specified .
`` There is no acquisition debt in this transaction , and that is important because it puts the company on a solid financial footing with no pressure on management to sell assets , '' he added .
The entire plan hinges on Petrie shareholder approval and whether the Internal Revenue Service rules that the transaction can be done tax-free .
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading , Petrie rose $ 1.125 to $ 26.625 .
Ms. Gibson declined in an interview to discuss operational plans for the stores under the new ownership .
But retailing executives say the Petrie stores , which operate in all 50 states , provide a competitive platform for her return to specialty retailing .
Separately , the Secaucus , N.J. , concern reported a loss of $ 14.8 million , or 32 cents a share , for its fiscal second quarter , ended July 30 , compared with a loss of $ 32.4 million , or 69 cents a share , a year earlier .
Last year 's results included a restructuring charge of $ 20.4 million , or 44 cents a share .
Revenue was $ 360.4 million , down slightly from $ 362.3 million a year ago .
The results were released after the market 's close .
YOU KNOW your work is hot stuff .
But your boss does n't always agree .
In fact , he belittles your talents , squashes your chances to shine or ignores your cries for help with advancement .
Your supervisor is a career blocker .
Unfortunately , you ca n't easily escape a career-blocking boss , because his downbeat judgment may color others ' view of you .
That 's what happened to Patrick Warner , a senior client manager for International Business Machines in Minneapolis .
Mr. Warner says he received a coveted offer last fall to become an instructor at IBM 's executive-education facility in Palisades , N.Y. .
But his boss called his prospective manager and told her that `` she did n't really know what she was getting and that I was n't a very good employee , '' Mr. Warner recalls .
The marketing man says he accused his fault-finding boss of unfairly attacking his reputation .
He replied , `` We ca n't afford to let you go .
You are one of our best people , '' according to Mr. Warner .
A spokeswoman says IBM does n't comment on former employees .
The teaching position fell through .
In January , the 16-year IBM veteran lost his job .
Mr. Warner blames the layoff on the stink he raised about his career-blocking boss .
On Aug. 1 , he became vice president of technology for two units of a Minneapolis conglomerate .
IBM has policies to help employees communicate with their superiors and avoid career blockage , a spokesman says .
Mr. Warner `` sounds like an exceptional case to me .
'' YOU CAN GET around a career blocker without committing career hara-kiri , counselors say .
For starters , hold a mirror to your supposedly stellar job performance .
`` You may be wrong .
Your boss may have nothing to do with your lack of a promotion , '' says Mortimer Feinberg , chairman of consultants BFS Psychological Associates in New York .
`` You may not be ready .
'' But maybe you are indeed ready .
A junior officer at a major Southern bank believed he was ready to fill certain higher-level jobs .
But his middle-aged boss discouraged him from pursuing a promotion because he was relatively inexperienced .
`` He put more emphasis on seniority than he did on ability , '' the officer remembers .
He says this dictatorial superior also gave him few chances to show his stuff .
The unhappy banker decided to flirt with headhunters and informed co-workers of his dissatisfaction .
When word spread , he got an unexpected promotion from another area of the bank .
About seven years later , he became the bank 's chief executive officer -- at age 40 .
Though his strategy for coping with a career blocker was n't deliberate , the executive was fortunate to have enlisted support from his peers , career advisers say .
Colleagues can alert you about openings in different departments and even can act as references , Dr. Feinberg notes .
`` If your boss is giving you unfair feedback , go to your peers , go to your subordinates and go to your customers '' to validate your talents , advises Beverly Kaye , a principal of Career Systems , a career-development concern in Scranton , Pa. .
There are other ways to circumvent a career-blocking boss rather than languish unnoticed .
Approach your boss 's boss as a last resort , however .
THOSE WHO do `` are often heroic .
They pay a price for their risk , '' says Harry Levinson , a management psychologist and chairman of the Levinson Institute in Belmont , Mass. .
At one Fortune 100 manufacturer where he consulted , Dr. Levinson reduced that risk for Jan Margolis , a promising human-resources manager , by alerting higher-ups that her boss was ignoring her potential .
Ms. Margolis helped to engineer the solution as well .
Ironically , Ms. Margolis 's job required her to develop a process for identifying high-potential employees .
To do this , she needed to work with senior executives on the policy committee , the company 's ruling body .
But her boss inexplicably forbade any such contacts .
`` I do n't know if he did n't want me to shine or if he was controlling , '' she says .
So , Ms. Margolis befriended workers in the aviation department to learn `` when anybody on the policy committee was taking a company plane to visit a subsidiary , '' she says .
`` Then , I would work to find a reason to also have to go to that subsidiary .
'' After sharing flights on the corporate jet with committee members , she often stayed at the same hotels and dined with them .
Her close rapport with those senior executives brought her invitations to join important task forces .
Finally , she adds , `` I could shine .
'' Yet the boss did n't abandon his career-blocking efforts , Ms. Margolis contends .
She says he reneged on the company 's promise of 30 days ' leave and paid travel so she could preside for a year over a national trade group , for example .
He insisted that the post had nothing to do with her job .
In disgust , she confronted her boss 's boss , the head of human resources .
`` I said , ` This has to change or I have to leave , ' '' she recollects .
Eighteen months later , her boss took early retirement -- and Ms. Margolis took his job .
QUITO , Ecuador -- Ecuador has renegotiated $ 7.58 billion in debt with some 400 U.S. banks and will resume payments next January , the government announced .
The 30-year agreement calls for Ecuador to resume payments at a rate of $ 200 million to $ 220 million a year , with a 45 % discount , according to Ana Lucia Armijos , head of the Central Bank 's Monetary Board .
Payments were suspended in 1987 after a massive earthquake crippled the nation 's economy .
Ms. Armijos said the agreement with the creditors will be signed in October in Madrid , during the International Monetary Fund gathering .
She said the agreement also calls for Ecuador to purchase U.S. Treasury bonds for $ 600 million to be exchanged by the original promissory notes now in the hands of the creditor banks .
The resources for the purchase of the bonds will be lent by the IMF , the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank , Ms. Armijos said .
Ecuador 's negotiations with the banks started in 1992 .
ALUMINUM CO. .
OF AMERICA -LRB- Pittsburgh -RRB- -- Peter R. Bridenbaugh , 54 years old , was given responsibility for the aluminum maker 's program to expand the use of aluminum in automobiles .
This marks the first time Alcoa has given one person responsibility for its technical and commercial initiatives in this area , which previously was handled independently by several business units .
Mr. Bridenbaugh continues as executive vice president and chief technical officer .
NEWTON , Mass. -- Marcam Corp. said it completed a previously announced restatement of its financial results for fiscal 1991 through the second quarter of fiscal 1994 , reducing total net income for the periods by $ 18.7 million .
Earlier this month , Marcam said it would restate its results for the past three years , largely reflecting a change in the accounting of its purchase of an International Business Machines Corp. software line .
At that time , Marcam said the restatements would lower net income for 1991 through 1993 by $ 16 million to $ 20 million .
The software concern added that the restatements resulted from its decision to account for the IBM line as a purchase rather than a product-licensing .
Marcam also said its lenders previously agreed to waive potential defaults arising from its restatements .
Separately , Marcam said that a class-action lawsuit was filed against the company , its chairman and chief executive , and its former chief financial officer .
A Marcam official said the suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Boston but declined to elaborate .
The company said it denies the allegations and intends to `` vigorously contest this action .
'' Additionally , Marcam reported a loss of $ 3.4 million , or 30 cents a share , for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30 , including write-offs of capitalized software , charges related to the integration of past acquisitions , and continued investment in international subsidiaries .
The loss compared with a restated year-earlier loss of $ 665,000 , or six cents a share .
Revenue rose to $ 45 million from $ 31.6 million .
ROCHESTER GAS & ELECTRIC Corp. -LRB- Rochester , N.Y. -RRB- -- This electric and gas utility is streamlining its internal organization .
It has restructured its 14 corporate divisions or division-sized functions into three areas -- customer operations , customer development and corporate services -- and has named executives to head each .
RG&E named Robert E. Smith , 56 years old , formerly senior vice president , to head the customer-operations area as senior vice president , customer operations .
Wilfred J. Schrouder Jr. , 53 , will head the second new area as vice president , customer development .
Mr. Schrouder previously had been a vice president .
Thomas S. Richards , 51 , previously senior vice president and general counsel , was named to head the corporate-services area .
His new title is senior vice president , corporate services , and general counsel .
As part of the restructuring , David K. Laniak , 58 , previously senior vice president for gas and electric distribution and customer services , was named executive vice president and chief operating officer .
Mr. Laniak was also named to the board .
His appointment returns the board 's size to 12 ; he fills a seat left vacant by the recent retirement of the company 's former chairman , Harry G. Saddock .
The Wampanoag Indian tribe signed a pact with Massachusetts to open the state 's first casino , paving the way for a significant expansion of gambling in the New England region .
The casino is n't expected to open for at least a year .
Currently , the six-state region only has one casino -- Foxwoods in Ledyard , Conn. , opened in 1992 .
Owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Indians , Foxwoods draws half its customers from surrounding states and has quickly become the nation 's most lucrative casino .
Last year , Foxwoods had estimated gross receipts of $ 800 million .
The preliminary agreement was signed by the Wampanoag Indians of Gay Head and Massachusetts Gov. William Weld .
The tribe is expected to spend $ 175 million to open both a casino and theme park in economically depressed New Bedford .
For the Wampanoags , the tribe that shared the first Thanksgiving but was nearly wiped out in ensuing wars with settlers , the pact represents a potential economic boon .
Foxwoods ' success has kindled excitement about gambling in New England , and several casinos are in various stages of development in the region .
In April , the Mohegan tribe signed an agreement with Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker to develop a second casino in that state near Norwich .
The Narragansett tribe is pursuing casino plans in Rhode Island .
And the Passamaquoddy Indian tribe in Maine has sought permission to build a casino on the Canadian border .
Indian tribes were given significant rights to open gambling enterprises in 1988 under the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act .
But a regional casino glut looms if all the plans are realized , said Nicholas Perna , chief economist at Boston 's Shawmut National Bank .
`` People are looking at Foxwoods like it 's Tom Terrific 's money machine , '' he said .
`` But when each casino is open , it could be like the condo market of the 1980s .
We could have a whole pile of half-empty casinos .
'' The `` memorandum of understanding '' between Massachusetts and the Wampanoags gives the tribe a six-year exclusive monopoly on casino gambling in eastern Massachusetts , according to state officials .
The state and surrounding communities would get $ 105 million annually from the new casino if it meets targeted gross gambling revenue of $ 375 million annually .
The casino 's contribution to state and local coffers would be less if gross revenue falls below $ 375 million a year .
The new casino is expected create 5,000 to 7,000 jobs .
The preliminary pact also provides for possible authorization by state legislators of a second casino in western Massachusetts and the installation of as many as 400 gambling machines at each of the state 's four race tracks .
The proposed casino , however , still must clear several hurdles , including acquisition of a proposed New Bedford site by a Wampanoag trust and approval by federal regulators .
HARTMARX Corp. -LRB- Chicago -RRB- -- Mary D. Allen , 48 years old , formerly senior vice president of JMB Realty Corp. , was named executive vice president and general counsel of this apparel maker .
She succeeds Carey Stein , who resigned in April .
INTERMET Corp. -LRB- Atlanta -RRB- -- George W. Mathews Jr. , 66 years old , is taking a temporary leave of absence as chairman and chief executive of this auto parts maker , citing unspecified health problems .
Curtis W. Tarr , 69-year-old vice chairman , will become acting chief executive .
In addition , the company said it is adding J. Mason Reynolds , 66 , to the executive committee of its board , bringing the total to four .
Mr. Reynolds was formerly executive vice president of AlliedSignal Corp. .
HOUSTON -- Veteran stock-pickers like to brag they 're never wrong , just early .
Global Marine might say just the same .
After taking on a hefty $ 1.2 billion in debt to build a top-of-the line fleet of offshore drilling rigs in the early 1980s , the company sank into bankruptcy as oil prices plunged below $ 10 a barrel and drilling ground to a near halt .
But the ill-fated construction program of the past decade means Global Marine now owns one of the largest , most modern fleets of offshore drilling rigs in the world at a time when demand for them is climbing steadily .
A Global buy is certainly risky : On Monday , as oil prices plunged after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to cut production , the stock fell 50 cents a share , or 11 % , to $ 3.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
-LRB- It was unchanged in yesterday 's trading .
-RRB- But some analysts say Global 's outlook remains solid and the stock will rebound , possibly doubling in the next several years as rising natural-gas prices push up day rates for rigs in the Gulf of Mexico .
James Carroll , an analyst at PaineWebber in New York , is maintaining his `` attractive '' rating on Global shares and says he will probably upgrade it to a `` buy '' if the stock drops further .
`` It 's really a natural-gas story , not an oil story , '' he says .
That 's not entirely true : While half of Global 's fleet is in the Gulf of Mexico drilling gas wells , the other half is elsewhere drilling oil wells , says David Herasimchuk , Global 's vice president of market development .
But many analysts argue that the drop in oil prices is temporary and wo n't hurt Global as it continues to profit from increased natural-gas drilling .
Forecasts of increased demand for natural gas have pulled the price of that commodity up from a low of $ 1 a thousand cubic feet in early 1992 to well over $ 2 a thousand cubic feet today .
Hurricane Andrew also boosted the price by destroying drilling platforms in the gas-rich gulf .
The current natural-gas market , which is good but not great , appears to favor Global , which owns 25 modern rigs , including 21 premium cantilever jackup rigs , a versatile variety most popular for drilling gas wells in the shallow gulf .
Rig rates still are n't strong enough to justify construction of new rigs .
Offshore Data Services estimates that day is at least three or four years away .
A rate of $ 65,000 a day is considered necessary to make the building of new rigs practical .
But rates are starting to surpass the break-even level for existing rigs .
Day rates for a 300-foot cantilever jackup rig rose to between $ 25,000 and $ 32,000 Nov. 1 from a range of $ 18,000 to $ 24,000 a year earlier .
Meanwhile , many of Global 's competitors are expending capital to repair rigs that are 20 to 30 years old and have been in storage since better times .
`` In general , their competition will have to start spending money earlier and reinvest just to keep their rig fleets from aging out , '' says Alan Leifer , portfolio manager of the Fidelity Trend Fund in Boston .
Global 's balance sheet now appears solid .
It shed much of its debt in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings in 1989 , and in a recapitalization completed last year , it further reduced its total debt by $ 143 million to $ 225 million .
The company says it faces no debt principal payments until 1999 .
Earnings , however , remain lousy .
Partly due to the cost of moving rigs to the gulf from slower markets in the North Sea and West Africa , Global had a loss of $ 28 million , or 19 cents a share , in this year 's first nine months .
Analysts predict a profit of only five to 15 cents a share for 1994 .
For any investor interested in taking a risk on Global , however , now may be the time .
James Wickland , an analyst at Rauscher Pierce Refsnes in Dallas , has found that an index of oil-service stocks generally peaks in August and falls to its lowest point at the end of November .
`` Between now and Christmas is an excellent buying opportunity '' for oil-service stocks , he says .
Other drilling contractors , including Energy Services and Rowan , are also smart buys , says Allen Brooks , an analyst at Howard , Weil , Labouisse , Friedrichs in Houston .
But Global is the favorite of many analysts because its executives in recent years have earned a reputation for savvy asset management .
In August , Global 's managers picked up three rigs good for gulf drilling in exchange for $ 17 million and a specialized rig for North Sea drilling .
`` If I were drilling a well , I 'd pick Rowan because it 's filled with a bunch of perfectionist engineers from Texas A&M University , '' says Mr. Wickland .
`` But as an investor , I 'd pick Global .
'' Of course , predicting demand for rigs has historically proved a risky business .
Surges in demand in 1984 and 1990 prompted speculation that the market was finally beginning to improve , but in both cases the changes proved short-lived .
Shares of Powell Industries , Houston , shed more than 14 % of their value last week to close at $ 6 .
The maker of electrical distribution and control equipment announced Nov. 24 that it will take a $ 5.5 million pretax charge for the fiscal year ended Oct. 31 .
Of that amount , $ 2.8 million is for the adoption of FASB Rule 106 , which requires companies to recognize the costs of retiree health benefits .
The rest of the charge is for lawsuit defense costs , restructuring of a minority investment and the probability that the company wo n't collect on a receivable .
The receivable relates to a contract for the sale of cogeneration equipment to the prime contractor of a cogeneration project at McDill Air Force Base , near Tampa , Fla. .
Earlier this year the Air Force terminated the prime contractor 's construction contract because of alleged default .
In fiscal 1992 , Powell had earnings of $ 8.4 million , or 81 cents a share .
Living Centers of America shares traded at 3.9 times their usual volume last week .
The Houston operator of long-term-care centers reported early in the week that an Alabama jury ruled the company 's newly acquired Vari-Care unit must pay $ 65 million in a lawsuit over the death of an 83-year-old resident of a Vari-Care facility .
Living Centers says it does n't believe the verdict `` is supported by the facts '' and plans to appeal .
Days before , Living Centers posted stronger earnings than expected for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 .
Net income rose 24 % to $ 3.6 million , or 38 cents a share , from $ 2.9 million , or 31 cents a share , a year earlier .
For the week , Living Centers shares fell 87.5 cents to close at $ 20.50 .
NEW YORK -- CBS Inc. said its offer to purchase as much as $ 1.1 billion of its shares through a previously announced self-tender was heavily oversubscribed and that it will buy about 27.05 % of the shares tendered .
The television and radio broadcasting concern said 12.6 million of its about 15.8 million common shares were tendered under the offer that expired Monday .
A subsidiary of Loews Corp. , controlled by Laurence A. Tisch , CBS chairman and chief executive , tendered all 3,029,375 of its shares .
Loews 's ownership of the reduced number of CBS shares will decline to 18 % from 19.4 % when the repurchase is completed .
Its prorated shares to be sold would be valued at $ 266 million at the offering price of $ 325 a share .
The company estimated the proration factor at 27.05 % although the exact figure wo n't be announced for several days .
CBS also said the record date for a previously disclosed 5-for-1 stock split will be determined on Sept. 14 when directors meet .
Under the offer , CBS will purchase 3.5 million of its common shares ; owners with 25 or fewer shares will be able to sell all their shares , and CBS said 109,834 such shares were tendered .
Other holders will be able to sell only a portion of their holdings .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , CBS common closed at $ 314 a share , up $ 2 a share .
WASHINGTON -- Political infighting is leaving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , the agency responsible for policing the country 's derivatives exchanges , essentially rudderless , people in the industry say .
The CFTC has been `` stopped in its tracks '' by delays in confirming SEC Commissioner Mary Schapiro as the CFTC 's new chairman , complains Robert G. Easton , chairman of the Managed Futures Association , a trade group for futures-investment advisers .
Traders , exchange executives , lobbyists and even some staff members of the CFTC are attacking with rare unanimity the political blockade of Ms. Schapiro 's appointment , which is being led by Sen. Jesse Helms .
`` Here we are , the biggest growth industry in the world , operating in a tremendously competitive global environment , and we ca n't get a response to simple rule-change proposals , '' says John F. Sandner , chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .
The Clinton administration appointed Ms. Schapiro to the post in May , after more than a year 's delay .
Since then , under rules that allow a single U.S. senator to block confirmation of any high-level appointee whose confirmation proceedings pass through his or her Senate committee , Sen. Helms -LRB- R. , N.C. -RRB- has prevented Ms. Schapiro from assuming her new post .
The senator has said he wo n't allow Ms. Schapiro to take her job until an unrelated Agriculture Department employee reassigned for remarks interpreted as antigay is reinstated to his old job .
Sen. Helms blames the holdup on Agriculture Secretary Michael Espy , who reassigned the employee .
Both the senator and the secretary have vowed not to budge from their positions .
John Damgard , chairman of the Futures Industry Association , an industry lobbying group , says the blockade `` apparently is good politics in North Carolina .
'' The result , traders , exchange executives and others say , is that a host of regulatory problems remain unchecked .
Among them : -- Dual trading , a controversial practice in which exchange brokers trade for their customers while simultaneously trading for their own profits , continues despite a 1992 law that sought to restrict it .
-- Efforts to improve exchanges ' abilities to track potential fraud among traders are lagging .
For instance , in response to a legal order to upgrade fraud-detection skills , futures exchanges have promised to install hand-held computers to create better audit trails .
But they 're far behind schedule .
The Chicago Merc and Chicago Board of Trade are saying they wo n't complete those programs in time to comply with the law .
The CFTC has n't said whether it will grant an extension .
-- The CFTC 's participation in a working group trying to devise appropriate regulation of derivatives is being hampered by lack of a coherent view from the top .
Derivatives -- which include exchange-traded futures and options , as well as privately negotiated contracts -- are the highly leveraged instruments whose values are based on , or derived from , prices of stocks , bonds , currencies , commodities or other underlying assets .
-- Budgetary constraints during the past three years have caused the CFTC 's staff to dwindle , even as its responsibilities mount .
Consequently , a flood of applications from exchanges for rule changes and other housekeeping measures has gone unanswered .
Ms. Schapiro , a veteran of the CFTC 's enforcement department who moved over to the SEC in 1988 , has a reputation as a tough and seasoned regulator , winning her support from politicians of both parties .
She was appointed to the SEC by President Reagan , and in 1993 President Clinton named her acting chairman of the SEC before current chairman Arthur Levitt took over the job .
`` My view , '' Ms. Schapiro says , `` is that this hurts both the industry and the public who invest in these markets , because without a chairman , the agency is not as strong as it should be .
'' Ms. Schapiro had pledged in her June testimony before the Senate agriculture committee to restore vigor to the CFTC .
Some exchange executives complain that the agency has weakly ceded its turf to other , more active regulators during the past few years .
In particular , they say the CFTC has allowed the SEC and other watchdogs to set the terms of regulatory debate on privately traded , or `` over-the-counter , '' derivatives -- a controversial market that is linked intimately to the exchange-traded financial futures and options that the CFTC does regulate .
While Ms. Schapiro takes a more conciliatory view , she cites three priorities she hopes to emphasize as CFTC chairman : enforcement proceedings against crooked traders ; the CFTC 's contribution to the debate about regulation of off-exchange derivatives ; and the agency 's budget , which has n't increased during the past three years despite rising costs .
`` In the course of my meetings with commissioners , I have heard real concerns about the length of time it takes to bring enforcement cases , '' she says .
`` I think the agency ought to bring more fraud cases , and faster .
'' As for derivatives , Ms. Schapiro adds , `` The CFTC ought to be a key voice in whether to regulate the over-the-counter derivatives market .
'' Most troubling for executives at the exchanges regulated by the CFTC is its sluggishness in handing down decisions on rule-change requests .
The Chicago Merc , for instance , has requested a regulatory exemption to trade currency instruments that it argues are identical to transactions on the unregulated `` spot '' currency market ; nearly two years later , the CFTC has n't responded .
`` I think Mary would make a big difference , '' Mr. Damgard says .
`` She brings an enormous amount of experience to an agency that needs it badly .
'' COFFEE : Coffee prices climbed on renewed concerns about a poor coffee harvest in Brazil .
On New York 's Coffee , Sugar & Cocoa Exchange , December-delivery coffee gained 8.10 cents to 1.9760 a pound .
`` Weather-related concerns shifted from worries about a freeze to worries about a lack of rainfall , '' said Bernard Savaiko , senior analyst at PaineWebber Inc. .
Coffee prices have shot higher this year as a result of two frosts in Brazil 's main coffee-producing regions .
Prices were as high as $ 2.74 a pound before retreating below $ 2 a pound as the concerns about the frosts appeared overstated .
Even so , Mr. Savaiko pointed out , `` the key is that a certain amount of damage has been done and world supplies are tight .
'' He said the dip below the $ 2 level may signal that coffee prices have hit bottom .
`` The longterm outlook is definitely bullish .
The question is : Do we get above $ 2 and determine this recent consolidation phase for the last two weeks is merely a pause with the market ready to resume its uptrend ?
'' he said .
`` I suspect it is .
'' He added that this is a seasonally slow period for coffee demand , which tends to revive during the colder months .
COTTON : Cotton prices surged in response to a pickup in demand , especially in Far Eastern markets .
Cotton for December delivery on the New York Cotton Exchange rose 1.19 cents to 67.85 cents a pound .
Analysts said one factor driving prices yesterday was an order for 50,000 480-pound bales for export to Asia .
That sale follows a purchase last week of 100,000 bales by South Korea .
Traders said cotton prices also were supported yesterday by a decline of deliverable supplies in New York .
Those supplies , which had earlier been put at 300,000 bales , fell to just 34,920 bales Friday , analysts said .
Further buoying prices was a report that speculators are selling more than they are buying , indicating the market may have overreacted recently to bearish news of a record U.S. harvest this year .
Sid Love , an analyst with Bill Helming Consulting Services Inc. , said the latest rating of the cotton crop 's condition put 56 % of the crop at good to excellent , up from 54 % last year .
But the U.S. Department of Agriculture is projecting this year 's crop will yield 690 pounds per acre , compared with 606 last year .
Mr. Love thinks the USDA may be overestimating the yield , however .
`` There 's not enough difference between the crop 's condition this year and last to warrant the difference between the yields of 606 pounds and 690 pounds , '' he said .
STOCKHOLM -- Gambro AB , a Swedish company that specializes in kidney dialysis machines and clinics , agreed to sell its intensive-care and anesthesia division to Instrumentarium OY of Finland .
Terms were n't disclosed .
But industry analysts estimated the Gambro division would fetch an amount roughly equal to annual sales : 450 million Swedish kronor -LRB- $ 60 million -RRB- .
Gambro operates a network of dialysis clinics in Europe and the U.S. DALLAS -- American Medical Electronics Inc. said it signed a letter of intent to acquire Advanced Spine Fixation Systems Inc. , a closely held medical-products distributor based in Cypress , Calif. .
American Medical , a maker of bonehealing products , said it plans to issue 2.5 million of its shares in the acquisition , subject to adjustment , depending on the company 's share price at closing .
Based on current market prices , 2.5 million shares would be valued at $ 20.6 million .
APPLIED INNOVATION Inc. -LRB- Dublin , Ohio -RRB- -- Roger Nielsen resigned as vice president-sales of this maker of data communications products .
Mr. Nielsen , 51 years old , left over `` differences regarding future direction of the company , '' Applied said .
His duties will be temporarily taken over by Jim Hinderliter , 35-year-old national sales manager at Applied .
PARIS -- Carrefour SA signed a joint venture with Chinese retailer Lianhua allowing the French company to open its first store on the Chinese mainland sometime after 1995 .
The joint venture will create a holding company to be 55 % - controlled by Carrefour , while Lianhua will have the remainder .
Lianhua operates 17 supermarkets in the Shanghai area .
Carrefour 's greatest presence in Asia currently is in Taiwan , where it has seven stores .
Carrefour also has opened stores in Malaysia and Thailand .
IRVING , Texas -- Esso Exploration Angola Ltd. , an affiliate of Exxon Corp. , signed a production-sharing agreement with Sonangol , the Angolan state oil company , for Block 15 offshore Angola .
Exxon said it has a 40 % interest in the block and will be the operator .
Other members of the contractor group are BP Exploration -LRB- Angola -RRB- Ltd. , a unit of British Petroleum ; AGIP Angola Ltd. , a unit of AGIP SpA , and Statoil A\/S .
NOVY JICIN , Czech Republic -- Jiri Macicek uses loads of statistics -- such as how long it takes a welder to find another job -- in telling the story of his district 's troubles .
But today , here in one of the Czech Republic 's most depressed cities , the director of the unemployment office ca n't locate anyone who is unemployed .
`` The problem is , everyone is on holiday , '' he explains after his secretary makes a few calls .
The unemployed people , he says , will `` be back after August .
'' Even in less balmy months it 's hard to find a Czech out of work .
Thanks to free-market dynamics and byzantine labor policies , the country seems to have achieved the impossible .
It is switching to capitalism while preserving that old communist crowd-pleaser , full employment .
At 3.5 % , the official Czech jobless rate for the end of 1993 is by far the lowest in Europe .
It is a fraction of the rate for Hungary , 12 % , and for Poland , 16 % .
-LRB- The Czech rate for July was 3.2 % .
-RRB- It is a stunning figure in a country where hundreds of privatized companies have slashed work forces -- and it 's one that Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus touts wherever he goes .
Many areas are so short of labor that everyone from road builders to farm bosses must import Poles , Ukrainians and Yugoslavs to do work the average Czech shuns .
The delicate balance that keeps unemployment so low fascinates economists and public-policy experts , who prowl the country looking for a loose brick that will make the whole system collapse .
Indeed , experts warn that this phenomenon is likely to last only as long as the forces that drive it -- which include government subsidies , delays in corporate restructuring and a boom in services .
`` You ca n't protect everyone , '' says Jan Mladek , a government adviser and independent economist .
In a rapidly evolving economy , `` sooner or later , you reach the breaking point .
'' Some components of the low rate are easier to describe than to quantify .
The shrinking work force , for instance -- which most experts say is now at least 5 % smaller than it was in 1990 -- stems in part from forced retirements and an increase in the number of women staying home .
Yet thousands of other workers have simply vanished into the tax-free black market -- or else they eke out a living on savings and meager welfare allowances or are seeking greener pastures abroad .
The unemployment rate also owes much to state-imposed wage ceilings that Mr. Klaus justifies as an inflation-curbing device .
For many factory bosses , low salaries so far have made mass firings unnecessary .
Even troubled companies have staggered layoffs , giving workers time to launch businesses or find other jobs .
Then there 's the booming service sector .
Since 1990 , nearly 30 % of the work force has shifted to jobs at banks , restaurants or shops , some sold off by the government but many others launched from scratch .
The Labor Ministry has promoted the flow with billions of korunas in seed money and subsidies , including payments to companies that hire the unemployed .
Mr. Mladek and others say Czech unemployment could shoot up to 6 % or higher -- about 300,000 jobless -- in the next two years as factories begin cutting closer to the bone and the growth in services peaks .
But at the moment , it 's as hard to find an unemployed Czech who wants to work as it is to find an unemployed Czech -- even in what should be the likeliest places .
The grittiest pub in this east Moravian town teems with half-soused , half-asleep men who nod that yes , they have jobs : laboring at the machine-tool plant , parking cars for an office building , hustling televisions over the Polish border , whatever .
In one corner sits Petr Simicek , who is 24 years old and officially jobless .
While watching friends play pool , he explains how he worked at the nearby Tatra truck factory until 1990 , then as a construction worker for two years .
For half a year after that he lived off monthly unemployment benefits of 2,800 korunas -LRB- $ 100.67 -RRB- .
Now he gets by on 1,000 korunas a month by working a day here and there .
`` It 's enough to buy food and pay my parents rent , '' he says .
Mr. Simicek concedes there are full-time jobs to be had , just none to his liking .
He wo n't settle for less than 8,000 korunas a month , one-third more than the average Czech wage .
`` I 'm a human being , '' he sniffs .
`` I want to find something suitable for me .
'' In the district surrounding Novy Jicin , the unemployment rate is 7.5 % , the country 's highest .
Still , with nearly 6,000 people looking for work , the district 's unemployment office lists hundreds of jobs that have been open for months .
Mr. Macicek , the office director , says migrants from countries further east fill slots on road crews or behind sewing machines at textile plants .
Prime Minister Klaus has long insisted that the Czech Republic wo n't suffer vast bankruptcies and soaring unemployment .
Today , most observers say he is right .
Czech factories produce competitive products , from Skoda automobiles to Pilsner Urquell beer .
But the government has rescued numerous troubled industries by forgiving old debts .
Major banks also do n't care to see their best customers collapse .
And thanks to privatization , the banks also now own large stakes in many former state companies .
In addition , new sectors are emerging , such as local production of Western consumer goods .
But as the economy shifts , sometimes more fundamental obstacles linger from the old days .
For instance , many Czechs simply do n't like to pull up roots for a new job -- even if it 's only a couple of hours away .
After all , under communism the jobs came to the workers , not the other way around .
`` The old regime corrupted the whole population , '' says Richard Falbr , head of the country 's association of trade unions .
Wages were low -- but jobs were steady , prices were stable and houses were cheap , he says .
`` Even now , the average Czech has a completely unrealistic view of the labor market and what they must do to compete .
'' New York state 's attorney general threatened to block the merger of Federated Department Stores Inc. and R.H. Macy & Co. unless the former rivals agree to sell all 12 Macy 's stores in the state 's southern region .
Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell said Federated must agree to sell the Macy 's flagship store in Manhattan 's Herald Square -- as well as 11 other stores in New York City , on Long Island and in Rockland and Westchester counties -- or else face litigation .
He is seeking a response by Aug. 30 .
Federated and Macy plan to merge in December .
The transaction would remove Macy from bankruptcy-court protection and create the nation 's largest department-store company , with annual sales of nearly $ 14 billion .
`` The department-store market is so concentrated that in some areas of New York , a combined Macy-Federated chain would have a virtual monopoly , '' Mr. Koppell said at a news conference in Manhattan .
`` Vendors would be squeezed , jobs would be lost , prices would rise and consumer choice would be eliminated .
'' Federated disagrees .
In a prepared statement , the company said a merger `` will enable the combined Federated and Macy 's to compete more effectively and to deliver greater value to consumers in an increasingly competitive retail environment .
'' Federated and the New York attorney general indicated they would continue talks to try to reach a settlement .
The heart of the argument is whether department stores are a discrete market or whether they compete equally with all types of retailers .
Together , Macy and Federated command 49 % of soft-goods sales in department stores in the New York area , but their combined share is less than 12 % when discount stores and specialty shops are taken into account , according to Tactical Retail Solutions Inc. , a retail industry consultant .
The Federal Trade Commission and the Florida attorney general have ended separate investigations into anticompetitive effects of the merger without taking action .
In New Jersey , where there is an overlapping of stores owned by Macy and Federated , the office of the attorney general did n't return calls seeking comment .
In Georgia , another overlapping market , there is no antitrust act , so no inquiry was made , the attorney general 's office said .
Federated stock fell 25 cents a share yesterday , closing at $ 20.125 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
Retail-industry observers were surprised that Mr. Koppell specified closing the Macy 's stores -- as opposed to some of the 26 Abraham & Straus , Bloomingdale 's and Stern 's stores that Federated operates in the region .
The cachet of the Macy 's name was a major reason Federated sought the merger .
In addition , Federated is expected to drop the A&S name and turn those stores into Macy 's stores or sell them to other companies .
Antitrust experts said forcing the sale of Macy 's stores was the most drastic but most powerful way to ensure competition .
`` Macy 's existing stores are stronger than A&S 's , '' said Lloyd Constantine , former head of the state 's antitrust unit .
And besides , he added , `` Why ask for something that they ` re willing to do in any event ?
'' Some retailing experts accused the attorney general of grandstanding in an election year .
`` Pure politics , '' said Isaac Lagnado , principal of Tactical Retail .
`` The New York consumer avails himself opportunistically of everything from Filene 's Basement to small specialty stores .
This is n't the New York of the 1960s , where department-store customers never wandered away from 34th Street .
'' Mr. Koppell denied that he was grandstanding and said he wanted to protect the interests of consumers , suppliers and real-estate developers .
He said divesting the Macy 's stores was the `` simplest '' remedy , but a spokesman said Mr. Koppell would listen to a counterproposal from Federated .
Mr. Koppell dismissed fears that a buyer other than Federated would n't preserve Macy 's high-profile promotional events , such as the Thanksgiving Day parade and Fourth of July fireworks .
`` Do you think if the Macy 's parade were called the Sears parade , people would n't come watch ?
'' he said .
WILLIAMS-SONOMA Inc. , San Francisco , announced a stock split of three shares for each two shares of common stock .
The split will be distributed Sept. 26 , to shareholders of record Sept. 7 .
The split increases the company 's outstanding shares to 25,173,000 .
NEW YORK -- Morgan Stanley Group Inc. said fiscal second-quarter net income fell 46 % as it struggled with the slowing underwriting and investment-banking climate , like many other Wall Street firms .
Net income for the quarter ended July 31 fell to $ 121 million , or $ 1.31 a share , from $ 224 million , or $ 2.77 a share , a year earlier .
Net revenue declined to $ 913 million from $ 1.15 billion .
The latest quarter 's results were slightly higher than the $ 117 million reported in the first quarter , but otherwise were the smallest since the 1992 third quarter , when the company had net income of $ 110 million .
Officials said rising interest rates in the U.S. and Europe reduced client debt and equity underwritings as well as fixed income and foreign-exchange trading .
`` Partially offsetting these declines were strong results from trading in equities and commodities and continued growth in the asset management and global custody businesses , '' said John J. Mack , president .
Chairman Richard B. Fisher said `` our long-term outlook remains positive .
The investments that Morgan Stanley is making today will provide the foundation for a stronger global position and greater market share in the future .
'' In New York Stock Exchange trading , Morgan Stanley shares rose $ 1.625 a share to close at $ 69.125 a share .
For the six months , net income fell 44 % to $ 238 million , or $ 2.58 a share , from $ 423 million , or $ 5.17 a share .
Net revenue declined to $ 1.80 billion from $ 2.19 billion .
Morgan Stanley said directors authorized purchase of an additional $ 200 million of its common stock , increasing the buyback to $ 278 million .
During the second quarter , Morgan Stanley repurchased about 1.2 million shares at an aggregate cost of $ 68 million .
WASHINGTON -- Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole presented 13 changes the GOP wants in the pending crime bill , as the Senate remained tied up in an extended political and procedural dance .
Democrats plan to discuss the GOP proposal today , but Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine doubts his fellow party members will like it .
`` It does not appear to me to be a proposal we can accept , '' he said .
And even if the Democrats do agree to the GOP plan , the crime bill , which is already six years in the making , would face an arduous journey .
After what could be a lengthy debate in the Senate , any changes in the legislation would have to be approved by the House .
Delay would be the order of the day .
Good government is worth the wait , some in the GOP argue .
Senate Republicans have said they will raise a parliamentary device , called a budget point of order , to halt the bill unless Democrats agree to consider changes .
The changes listed by Sen. Dole of Kansas include four amendments that would cut $ 5 billion from the bill 's crime-prevention budget , four that would toughen prison provisions and other changes that would strengthen mandatory minimum sentences .
Both Republicans and Democrats are acutely aware of the political importance of the crime issue , and both want to be seen as aggressively attacking the problem .
In a speech yesterday , President Clinton said , `` We 're on the verge of winning the fight to make our streets safer for law-abiding Americans .
'' By delaying the Senate vote , Republicans risk being painted as partisan obstructionists preventing the deployment of 100,000 police officers , the opening of new prison cells and the sentencing of criminals , particularly three-time violent felons , to long prison terms .
But William Kristol , who was Vice President Dan Quayle 's chief of staff , said blocking the crime bill `` is a risk Republicans can afford to take .
'' The short-term pain will be compensated by long-term gain , he argues .
`` The risk would be that Clinton could label Republicans as merely partisan and obstructionist , '' he said .
`` The good news about that is ... we 're helped by Clinton 's political weakness .
'' Republicans hope to exploit that perceived weakness to take the debate beyond the confines of the crime bill .
They want to set the terms of the debate on the larger issue of how America is governed .
Mr. Kristol sees the crime bill as a perfect example of `` much that is bad about contemporary congressional lawmaking .
'' He takes issue with what it means `` to make , '' as Mr. Clinton says , `` this national government work again .
'' House Republicans succeeded earlier in making the White House backpedal ; after they blocked consideration of the legislation in that chamber , the Clinton administration agreed to some changes similar to those sought by Mr. Dole .
But simply cutting crime-prevention money or boosting law enforcement misses the larger point for Republicans , Mr. Kristol argues .
The main Republican argument should be that the federal government should n't expand its reach .
The American people do n't want big government , he says , and to the extent his party can cast the debate in those terms , it will broaden its orbit .
His partisans in Congress should use the crime-bill debate `` to expose the Clinton administration agenda and precisely the indiscriminate kind of enlargement of the government that Americans do n't want to see , '' he says .
Republicans thus defend their proposals as designed to purge social-spending `` pork , '' while keeping effective crime-prevention programs .
The budget point of order , more than a mere parliamentary device , they contend , may be needed to correct legislation whose spending grew from $ 22 billion when it left the Senate last year to $ 30 billion today .
Democrats counter that the Republicans are motivated primarily by partisan political considerations .
A White House fact sheet , for instance , said Republicans previously backed many of the programs that they now denounce -- including a grant program to work with gang members and juveniles , funds for midnight basketball to give youths an alternative to spending late nights on the streets , and other crime-prevention programs .
Some Democrats suggested that the Republicans ' real objective is to defeat a provision in the bill banning certain assault weapons .
On that issue , they seemed to score some points ; Sen. Dole did n't include the weapon provision in his list of 13 problems with the bill , although it had been on an earlier list .
Sen. Mitchell , however , contended that opening the bill to amendments would allow a legislative attack on the weapon provision in the House , where forces opposed to gun control were instrumental in the earlier delay .
`` Those who charge that this is some back-door attempt to eliminate the gun ban are firing blanks , '' Mr. Dole responded .
Senate opponents of the provision , however , could wage a filibuster against it at any point during the Senate 's debate .
Despite the rhetoric over spending , virtually all of the proposed expenditures in the crime bill will be subject to annual votes in Congress as part of the regular appropriations process .
The more substantive budget fight is about the years 1999 and 2000 .
Appropriations bills now are governed by spending caps that originated with the Bush administration and have been extended through 1998 .
The first $ 17 billion under the crime bill is designed to respect these limits , but Republicans complain that in 1999 and 2000 , when an estimated $ 13 billion would be authorized , no spending caps have yet been set and the crime bill could then add to the deficit .

NEW YORK -- After rallying on technical factors in Asian trading , the dollar surged yet higher in North American trading as U.S. financial markets soared .
Traders said intervention by the Bank of Japan , a weaker mark and a perception the market was short of dollars also contributed to the currency 's resurgence .
But traders said that the dollar 's gains largely represent a short-term consolidation , and that they expected the downward push on the dollar to resume .
They said the market has been bearish toward the U.S. currency for some time , and nothing happened yesterday to change the market 's view that the dollar will continue to fall .
In late afternoon New York trading , the dollar was quoted at 1.5461 marks , up from 1.5325 marks late Tuesday in New York .
The U.S. currency also was changing hands at 99 yen , up from 97.98 yen .
Sterling was trading at $ 1.5530 , down from $ 1.5560 .
About noon Thursday in Tokyo , the dollar was trading at 1.5486 marks and at 99.45 yen ; sterling was at $ 1.5515 .
Traders said the dollar got off to a good start in Asian trading early yesterday when , according to an unconfirmed rumor , a Swiss bank sold a large quantity of marks for dollars .
Traders said heightened volatility brought on by thin summer trading volumes exaggerated the purchase 's effect on the market , and pushed the dollar through technical resistance around 1.5400 marks .
That , in turn , triggered stop-loss orders as traders sought to avoid getting caught short of dollars in a rising market .
Later , the dollar also was boosted by the tide of higher U.S. bond and stock prices , which soared when the U.S. Treasury 's five-year note auction went much better than expected .
Financial markets also were helped by news of a surprise drop in U.S. durable-goods orders last month .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 70.90 points to close at 3846.73 .
The yield on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell to 7.45 % from 7.54 % a day earlier .
Traders said recent intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar has been surprisingly successful , considering that concerted intervention by as many as 19 central banks earlier this summer failed to reverse the dollar 's downtrend .
Japan 's central bank was sighted buying dollars intermittently around 97.65 yen in Asian dealings , and succeeded in pushing the dollar above that level .
The Bank of Japan 's solitary intervention worked only because the market had oversold the dollar , especially against the mark , said Peter Iversen , vice president at Shawmut Bank of Boston .
Indeed , the mark fell broadly against European currencies yesterday , helping to sustain the dollar 's rally into the North American day .
Late in New York , the mark was trading at 3.4254 French francs yesterday , down from 3.4296 francs late Tuesday .
The pound rose to 2.4000 marks from 2.3854 marks .
But traders said the dollar is unlikely to move significantly higher anytime soon .
They said its inability to break convincingly through resistance at 99 yen and 1.5450 marks yesterday showed that buyer interest remains weak .
`` The fundamentals have n't changed , '' Mr. Iversen said .
`` I still think the dollar is heading lower .
'' He added that the large U.S. current account and budget deficits , and a market perception that the Clinton administration is in trouble , are the fundamental factors driving the dollar lower .
Traders said the dollar fell only briefly on news that U.S. durable-goods orders , or those meant to last at least three years , fell 4.2 % in July , compared with market expectations of a 0.1 % rise .
They said the data appeared to suggest the U.S. economy slowed significantly last month .
But the dollar continued to rise after analysts decided the numbers were distorted by seasonal shutdowns in defense and other industries .
Though bullish for Treasurys , a slowing economy works against the dollar because it decreases the likelihood of Federal Reserve interest-rate increases .
TOKYO -- NEC Corp. said it is exploring the possibility of selling IBM-compatible personal computers in Japan , exposing a major chink in the armor of NEC , Japan 's dominant PC maker .
For years , NEC has led the Japanese market with PCs made to its own design .
Its PCs have been incompatible with the de facto international standard , set by International Business Machines Corp. .
However , NEC says it is considering selling in the Japanese market a type of IBM-compatible PC known as a server , a move that would mark the first time it has sold an IBM-style PC in Japan .
Servers are fast computers that sit at the hub of PC networks .
Like most Japanese computer makers , NEC does sell IBM-compatible PCs outside Japan , although its success in the international market has been limited .
Analysts said the move marks NEC 's first step away from its proprietary PC design .
`` It would be hopeless for them to keep trying to offer their own system in Japan , '' said Reinier Dobbelmann , an analyst with S.G. Warburg -LRB- Japan -RRB- Inc. .
For most of two years , U.S. PC makers have waged a bruising price war with NEC in Japan .
Average prices have fallen steeply , and NEC 's market share has started to follow .
Last year , its share fell from 52 % to 48 % , according to market-research firm International Data Corp. .
NEC denied that it intends abandon its proprietary design .
`` We 're not operating from a position of weakness here , '' a spokesman said .
`` In fact , we think we 're gaining share .
'' NEC recently lifted its PC-shipment forecast for the current year to a 30 % increase over last year , up from an earlier 11 % forecast .
NEW YORK -- An institutional shareholder of Borland International Inc. said it is withdrawing support for Philippe Kahn , the company 's chairman and chief executive , following disclosures about Mr. Kahn 's use of company funds and Borland 's poor stock performance .
The College Retirement Equities Fund , a New York-based pension fund for employees at U.S. educational and research institutions , cited disclosures in Borland 's proxy statement , which were the subject of an article in this newspaper Aug. 18 .
A spokesman for the fund said it owns 348,000 Borland shares , but can only vote 8,237 shares at Borland 's Aug. 30 annual meeting because most of its Borland stake is lent out as part of a securities lending operation .
Borland had 32.8 million shares outstanding as of June 30 .
The proxy statement disclosed that Mr. Kahn used company funds for personal expenses that included the cost of producing three jazz recordings and for personal travel .
Borland , based in Scotts Valley , Calif. , said Mr. Kahn does n't owe the company money because it withheld bonuses owed him .
Borland also disclosed that it had granted Mr. Kahn options to buy one million shares of the company 's stock at $ 12.50 a share , and had repriced at $ 9 others that had originally been priced much higher .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading , Borland 's stock fell 7.3 % to close at $ 12.625 , down $ 1 a share .
CREF cited the expenditures and option grants , and said Borland 's board failed to meet its responsibility to protect shareholder assets .
A Borland spokesman said the issues related to Mr. Kahn were handled appropriately and in the best interests of the company and its stockholders .
NEW YORK -- A New York Stock Exchange arbitration panel ordered CS First Boston Inc. to pay a total of $ 5 million to a group of doctors who claimed that the big investment bank gave a faulty fairness opinion in a 1992 merger of two medical companies .
The award is the largest ever handed down at the Big Board in an arbitration case , securities lawyers said .
And it 's apparently the first time an arbitration panel decided a case over a fairness opinion .
A fairness opinion is a formal review conducted by an investment bank , which examines a proposed merger or other transaction and decides whether the deal is fair to shareholders .
Typically , when shareholders object to a fairness opinion , they file a civil lawsuit , and the case is decided by a judge or jury .
The award puts Wall Street investment banks on notice that they ca n't simply act as a rubber-stamp in rendering such opinions , securities lawyers said .
At the same time , some securities specialists worried that Big Board arbitrators are n't equipped to handle such an issue , considering that many arbitrators are n't schooled in the complex and arcane world of investment banking .
Most securities arbitrations involve disputes with individual-investor accounts .
`` I do n't think of arbitrators being particularly able to deal with those kinds of issues , '' said Sam Scott Miller , a New York lawyer and former general counsel at PaineWebber Group Inc. .
CS First Boston declined to comment , as did J. Boyd Page and Brian Smiley , partners at Page & Bacek , an Atlanta law firm that represented the plaintiffs .
The case stemmed from the 1992 merger that created Medical Care America Inc. The Dallas health-care provider was formed by the merger of Medical Care International Inc. , an outpatient surgery company , and Critical Care America Inc. , a home-infusion therapy concern .
CS First Boston was paid $ 3 million to examine both companies and to certify to the holders of Medical Care International that the proposed merger terms were fair .
Though Medical Care officials claimed the merger would let the companies offer broader services at lower cost , intensified competition drove down prices for home-infusion services .
Indeed , only several weeks after the merger was approved in September 1992 , Medical Care 's stock price plummeted 50 % on news that the operating results for the Critical Care division would be much lower than projected , the doctors said in their claim filed with Big Board arbitrators .
The arbitration claim was filed a year ago by a dozen doctors who were former shareholders of Medical Care International .
The claim accuses the CS Holding unit of relying on managements ' financial projections for its fairness opinion , rather than doing an independent analysis of the two companies ' financial statements .
Had CS First Boston `` conducted even a minimal investigation of the financial statements and projections provided to it by Critical Care America 's management -- rather than blindly relying on them -- it would not have been able to issue the fairness opinion sent to the claimants , and the merger would never have been approved , '' the arbitration claim says .
Indeed , the claim says CS First Boston conceded that it did n't do any independent digging in the matter .
CS First Boston 's fairness opinion , which was filed with arbitrators , said that `` we have reviewed ... financial forecasts provided to us by Medical Care International and Critical Care '' and `` we have not independently verified any of the foregoing information .
'' Because of the allegedly faulty opinion , Critical Care was overvalued in the deal , the arbitration claim alleges .
Thus , Critical Care shareholders received too many Medical Care America shares , and Medical Care International holders received too few Medical Care America shares under the stock exchange ratios certified by CS First Boston , according to the claim .
The plaintiffs sought a total of $ 13 million in damages .
Without comment , the arbitration panel ordered CS First Boston to pay $ 4.5 million in damages , plus attorneys ' fees of $ 500,000 .
FRANKFURT -- Hoechst AG 's pretax profit soared 39 % in the first half , and Europe 's largest chemical maker said a strong industry recovery under way will lift full-year profit `` considerably above '' weak 1993 results .
Hoechst 's earnings in the first six months rose to 1.09 billion marks -LRB- $ 711.2 million -RRB- from 781 million marks a year earlier , outpacing many analysts ' predictions .
Hoechst said first-half sales rose 8 % to 24.7 billion marks from 22.9 billion marks .
Prices remained `` unsatisfactory , '' but volume demand continued to increase in Europe , Asia and the U.S. , the company said .
In Germany , where the economic upturn has been slower in coming , demand also picked up .
Hoechst 's performance comes in the wake of improved results from several other leading European chemical companies , and suggests a broad recovery is bolstering a once hard-hit industry .
At BASF AG of Germany , pretax profit rose 41 % in the first six months , while Imperial Chemical Industries PLC of Britain reported that pretax earnings climbed 40 % .
Bayer AG , the third of Germany 's so-called Big Three chemical companies , will report today .
Analysts say that Bayer was less affected by the recession in the European chemical business during the early 1990s because of its limited involvement in bulk chemicals .
Therefore , its potential to be lifted by the recovery is n't as great .
Jackie Ashurst , chemical analyst at James Capel & Co. in London , said several factors are benefiting European chemical companies , including a recovery in sales volumes , improved prices in some areas and better agrochemical sales .
It 's been almost four months since Nelson Mandela became president of South Africa and the ugly racial spoils system of apartheid ended .
It is therefore of more than passing irony that the U.S. Agency for International Development has decided to make race a decisive factor in the awarding of contracts and grants to implement its three-year , $ 528 million assistance program for post-apartheid South Africa .
According to internal AID documents , it is now the policy of the U.S. government that the portion of South Africa funding that is not channeled directly to South Africans -- over a third last year , and set to rise -- should be passed exclusively through African-American contractors , and not subject to free and open competition .
Apartheid 's complex system of racial classification was difficult to administer .
It required a special type of bureaucratic mind to impose rigid racial categories on a diverse population .
AID 's variant is no cinch either .
Consider the draft of a Dec. 6 , 1993 , cable from legal adviser for the AID mission in Pretoria , Donald Keene , to AID headquarters in Washington .
Mr. Keene was seeking guidance because the African-Americans-only policy was so extreme as to be potentially illegal under existing set-aside laws , which already guarantee nonwhite entities at least a 10 % share of any government contract .
Those laws are principally to be found in Section 8 -LRB- a -RRB- of the Small Business Act -LRB- as most recently revised in 1989 -RRB- and the 1991 Gray Amendment , named after its author , former Rep. William Gray -LRB- now Mr. Clinton 's Haiti coordinator -RRB- .
Part of the mission 's difficulty , Mr. Keene explained , was that neither statute favors only African-Americans .
Both award preferences to anyone judged `` socially and economically disadvantaged .
'' That category , defined in Federal Acquisition Regulations Section 19.001 , is quite broad .
In addition to African-Americans , it encompasses Hispanics , American Indians , Aleuts and Native Hawaiians , plus any people who can trace their origins to anywhere from Pakistan eastward to the California coast , excluding Russia , Australia and New Zealand .
Mr. Keene 's as yet unresolved problem : how to prevent members of the non-African-American disadvantaged from getting in on the South Africa game ?
Adding to the lawyer 's quandary , one of the contracts the mission was planning to let was intended for a specific subset of African-Americans : U.S. schools like Howard and Grambling , officially designated by the secretary of education as `` historically black colleges and universities , '' or HBCUs .
Under pressure to help these institutions , AID agreed they should be the prime contractors for a $ 30 million project to assist formerly segregated black universities in South Africa .
This agreement was justified , Mr. Keene wrote , on the grounds that HBCUs had unique `` experience and expertise '' for the task , since they had emerged in parallel circumstances of racial victimization .
The Gray amendment stipulates that HBCUs should be given preferential treatment in the award of Africa-related AID contracts , but they have to share it with schools whose student bodies are more than 40 % Hispanic and with small minority businesses generally .
There is , as Mr. Keene pointed out , no special HBCU set-aside .
Mr. Keene considered the possibility of so rigging the bid solicitation that only HBCUs could fit the bill , but concluded that even this would be problematic .
`` Many HBCUs do not have significant ... knowledge of and experience in the SA -LCB- South African -RCB- environment .
Thus ... they may be at a competitive disadvantage .
'' Ergo , by Mr. Keene 's own admission , they might not be uniquely qualified after all .
The legal adviser was running into similar difficulties with a five-year , $ 15 million project called Business Development and Support , an effort to increase the effectiveness of fledgling black South African chambers of commerce .
The plan was to contract with a U.S. company that could provide these groups with access to the management , legal and accounting skills they desperately needed .
This posed an interesting dilemma .
First of all , as Mr. Keene explained , existing set-aside rules could not guarantee that an African-American company -- as opposed , to say , an Aleut one -- would be the most qualified bidder .
Second , no Section 8 -LRB- a -RRB- company had `` sufficient breadth of capabilities '' for the proposed job .
As for the Gray Amendment , it was targeted at really small companies grossing less than $ 3.5 million a year .
AID needed someone bigger .
Mr. Keene concluded that if AID wanted all external contracts to go to African-American entities , as was its policy and his own devout wish , it was going to have to change the rules either `` so as not to prevent Gray Amendment firms with limited resources and capabilities from being awarded contracts '' or to allow larger , more established , black-owned companies to have a shot .
AID has solved the HBCU riddle by effectively obliging South African universities that want American help to obtain at least half of it from HBCUs , thus end-running the contract process .
The business program was simply put on ice .
Actually , there was an easy solution in both instances : AID 's own version of insider trading .
Earlier this year , Africare , a prominent African-American nongovernmental organization whose director , C. Payne Lucas , featured prominently at Mr. Clinton 's recent White House conference on Africa , was given a $ 2 million grant to identify and train `` future policy makers '' in South Africa .
The organization had reason to believe AID was interested in this kind of thing and so submitted an unsolicited proposal last December .
Under its rules , AID is permitted to accept such proposals without subjecting them to competitive bidding .
Those who disagree with the administration 's set-aside policy have been accused by Washington 's ambassador in Pretoria , Princeton Lyman , of practicing `` subtle racism '' by suggesting that African-Americans can not perform as well as others .
His argument is perverse .
For one thing , American officials like Mr. Keene , who is himself fully in favor of the blacks-only program , concede in their own internal documents that AID 's ability to find contractors with the necessary qualifications has been compromised .
Second , whatever racism is involved here lies in the suggestion , evidently accepted by the ambassador , that African-Americans are not good enough to succeed in open competition .
What is driving AID 's neo-apartheid policy ?
A good part of the explanation can be found in a speech that the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave at a U.S. Information Agency-sponsored conference in Atlanta last June , which brought together black civil-rights groups and businessmen to discuss opportunities in the new South Africa .
Mr. Jackson contended that African-Americans should have a privileged place on the South Africa gravy train because of the `` sweat equity '' and `` jail equity '' they had built up in the anti-apartheid struggle .
Most AID officials seem to have no sense of the irony of America 's practicing apartheid-like job reservation in post-apartheid South Africa .
They should read the letter that Harry Johnson , a veteran officer in AID 's Pretoria mission , wrote to AID administrator Brian Atwood shortly after leaving the agency in April .
Many black South Africans , he warned , `` see U.S. set-aside procurement in assistance programs as being too closely associated with the racial separation they are now trying to eliminate , and as blocking them from the best the U.S. has to offer in their quest for a viable multiracial economy and society .

TOKYO -- Japan 's vaunted system of corporate cross-shareholdings could be unraveling .
Japan 's mammoth banks , centerpieces in Japan 's `` keiretsu '' corporate business groupings , appear to be selling some of their strategic shareholdings in other corporations .
And analysts say companies are responding in kind , unloading bank shares .
The upshot is that Japan 's stock market may face downward pressure as the market tries to absorb shares that banks and businesses no longer deem strategically beneficial to hold .
In particular , foreign investors , who have helped fuel a 15 % rise in the Nikkei stock average this year , could lose if the unwinding of business relationships gathers momentum .
`` Obviously , this is a negative for the market , '' said Keith Donaldson , strategist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo .
`` It 's this sort of selling , particularly by corporations , that led to the crash '' in Japanese stock prices in the early 1990s .
The strains on the time-honored Japanese business practice of cross-shareholding stem from the nation 's economic sluggishness .
Banks need to free up capital to write off trillions of yen in bad loans .
Corporations , battered by recession and a strong yen , are finding that holding expensive stakes in a variety of lenders is no longer feasible .
Hard statistics supporting the trend are difficult to come by because of Japan 's loose disclosure requirements .
And Japanese businesses are wary of revealing how alliances may be changing .
But several recent reports support the conclusion that the affiliations are coming undone .
Nomura Research Institute , the research arm of Japan 's largest brokerage , Nomura Securities Co. , said this week that Japan 's 21 biggest banks were net sellers of 47.7 billion yen -LRB- $ 486.5 million -RRB- in shares in the 12 months ended March 31 .
Japan 's seven trust banks , particularly hard hit by problem loans , were net sellers of 75.2 billion yen in shares .
Meanwhile , a recent survey by the financial daily Nikkei Kinyu found that Japan 's top 100 corporations were aggressive sellers of bank stocks , unloading 99.67 million shares in Japan 's biggest 21 banks in the same 12 months .
Foreign investors seem to be picking up what banks and businesses are unloading .
Foreigners bought 403 million shares in Japan 's biggest 21 banks during the year ended March 31 , up 48 % from a year ago , says a report by Salomon Brothers .
Indeed , recent foreign interest in Japanese bank shares has helped push up Japan 's benchmark Nikkei stock average 15 % since January .
To be sure , Japan 's complicated web of corporate shareholding relationships wo n't come undone overnight .
Analysts say the economic downturn is causing businesses to rid themselves of the least important of their alliances .
Analysts estimate that between 60 % and 70 % of listed stocks in Japan are held by long-term investors for strategic purposes .
Yet , the relatively limited number of the remaining `` free floating '' shares only highlights the volatility caused by the cross-holding arrangements : Any move to unload even a small holding in a business partner can have an exaggerated effect on the stock market .
And with large new issues scheduled in coming months , including a major privatization this fall of government-owned Japan Tobacco Inc. , analysts say the tendency for businesses to unwind cross-shareholdings could be a concern for investors for a long time .
`` This is going to be a source of supply in the stock market over the next 10 to 15 years , '' said Mr. Donaldson of Salomon Brothers .
BUFFALO , N.Y. -- J.A. Gilroy , 57 years old , was named to the new post of chief operating officer at Varity Corp. , effective Nov. 1 , when the company 's president , Vincent D. Laurenzo , 55 , plans to retire .

LONDON -- Body Shop International PLC shares plummeted 4.4 % in trading on the London Stock Exchange following reports that some `` ethical '' investment funds had soured on the company , and that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating a dispute between the company and its U.S. franchisees .
Body Shop Chairman T. Gordon Roddick referred to the reports , largely in the British press , as `` nonsense being created by zealots of cynicism .
'' Nevertheless , Body Shop stock dropped yesterday to 217 pence -LRB- $ 3.38 -RRB- a share from 227 pence a share , when the London market overall was up 1 % .
Though yesterday 's decline appeared to stem from the recent press reports , Body Shop stock has been declining steadily since Aug. 11 , reflecting investor concerns about recent bad publicity swirling around the image-conscious maker of personal-care products .
The exact nature of the dispute between the U.S. franchisees and Body Shop remains unclear .
The FTC has refused to comment .
Mr. Roddick confirmed that the FTC has sought information from it , but called the inquiry `` routine .
'' `` The FTC had made one request for information , '' he said .
`` We voluntarily provided all the information they requested .
We have heard nothing for nine months .
'' Susan P. Kezios , president of the American Franchisee Association , a franchisee-advocacy group based in Chicago , said she has heard complaints during the past year from several U.S. franchisees of Body Shop .
These franchisees complained separately of high markups on products sold to them by the franchiser for resale , she said .
The franchisees also allege that Body Shop makes misleading claims to potential franchisees about the earnings that franchisees can expect to make , Ms. Kezios added .
Ms. Kezios said she does n't know if the franchisees complained to the FTC , or if the FTC is investigating the company .
Not all FTC inquiries signal a formal investigation , and not all investigations lead to charges .
Meanwhile , two so-called green mutual funds recently sold large chunks of Body Shop stock .
Franklin Research & Development Corp. , a Boston-based socially conscious fund disclosed that in June it sold 50,000 Body Shop shares it managed for clients , citing primarily financial concerns .
For over a year now , money managers have expressed concern that the rapid growth Body Shop enjoyed in its early years ca n't be sustained .
From a single store in Brighton , England , in 1976 , Body Shop and its franchisees now operate about 1,000 stores world-wide .
Their trademark forest-green shops , selling the likes of Peppermint Foot Lotion and Fuzzy Peach Shower Gel , are a mainstay of shopping malls from Chicago to Kuwait City .
Body Shop 's current problems stem partly from its success , which has spawned a series of copy-cat companies that market products similar to the Body Shop 's , at much lower prices .
In addition , its self-promotion as a socially conscious company that treats animals and the environment well opens it up to scrutiny .
For instance , there have been recent press reports raising concerns about Body Shop 's trading policy with Third World countries and allegations that some of its product ingredients are so environmentally friendly .
Body Shop 's Mr. Roddick yesterday slammed media coverage of a spill involving 30 gallons of `` oil-based ingredients '' that occurred two years ago at a factory Body Shop then owned in New Jersey .
Mr. Roddick said the oil involved was mineral oil used in shampoo .
`` This is the same ingredient which has been slapped on babies ' bums for generations in England without adverse effect , '' he said .
Mr. Roddick also defended Body Shop 's much publicized `` Trade Not Aid '' policy with Third World countries .
New Consumer , a research group , publicly has criticized Body Shop , saying it buys far less ingredients from the Third World than its advertising suggests .
Mr. Roddick countered that Body Shop buys as much raw material from the Third World as it can use in its products .
For instance , Body Shop buys Brazil nuts from the Kayapo Indians in the Amazon region , he says , for use in hair conditioner .
But nut oil accounts for only 1.5 % of the volume of the conditioner .
`` That is what works .
Use more and your head would look like an oily mop , '' he said .
But the bad publicity has its affect .
Patrick McVeigh , Franklin Research & Development 's senior vice president , stresses that when the fund sold its Body Shop shares in June , he felt the stock had peaked , rising 29 % in the first half of the year .
But he also said the fund was concerned that the recent negative press would hurt the company 's stock price in the short term .
Mr. McVeigh added that Franklin is `` independently researching a report on the Body Shop 's ethical performance , which we have not finished , nor have we reached any conclusions .
'' NPI Global Care Fund , another green fund , said it sold its Body Shop holdings at the beginning of the year `` but for investment reasons .
It has nothing to do with ethics .
'' Body Shop remains on NPI 's approved list , but the London-based fund said it is researching the recent press reports that called Body Shop 's practices into question .
Body Shop remains profitable .
Pretax profits increased 38 % in the fiscal year ended Feb. 28 to 29.7 million -LRB- $ 46.2 million -RRB- or 10.30 pence a share , from 21.5 million , or 7.40 pence a share , a year earlier .

Jim Bernau had a lucrative idea -- and many of his competitors think less of him for it .
Last year , Mr. Bernau sold stock in a proposed microbrewery , Willamette Valley Brewing Co. , to investors in Oregon .
Then he built the brewery and invited shareholders , whom he calls `` founders , '' to help bottle , sell and promote the beer .
He also gave them discounts on the brew , and encouraged them to carry business cards and to insist that local bars and restaurants put `` their '' beer on tap .
The plan worked fabulously .
By its first anniversary , in November , Mr. Bernau 's new microbrewery on the banks of the Willamette River in Portland , Ore. , is expected to sell at least 15,000 barrels of its Nor ` Wester beer .
-LRB- Most microbreweries sell only 1,000 to 3,000 barrels in their first year .
-RRB- Now , Mr. Bernau is hoping to repeat that success in several other cities , including Denver , Seattle and Irvine , Calif. .
But Mr. Bernau 's microbrewing operation bothers some other small beer makers .
For a decade , the industry was dominated by home-brewers who , usually with the help of a wealthy sidekick or relative , started a microbrewery for the `` love of beer .
'' These start-up brewers called their business `` craft '' brewing as opposed to the `` industrial '' brewing of big brewers , and told themselves and their customers that they were in business to brew good beer , not simply to make money .
Not surprisingly , these brewers consider Mr. Bernau 's style far from craftsmanlike .
`` He 's very marketing oriented , '' says Gene Clark , a vice president of Portland Brewing Co. .
In his opinion , Mr. Bernau is merely a `` promoter .
'' Kurt Widmer , a former home-brewer who founded Portland 's Widmer Brewing Co. 10 years ago , says that profit seekers such as Mr. Bernau are robbing the industry of its charm .
`` The fun in commiserating with other beer people has gone by the wayside , '' he says , `` because these new people are n't beer people .
'' Yet the arrival of business types was probably inevitable , given that even the most artisanal microbrewers have often quietly prospered .
For one thing , they tend to charge three times the cost of a Coors , Miller or Budweiser for their beer .
And because they forgo heavy promotions and ad campaigns , their margins are fat .
Recognizing these attractions , investors and financiers invaded this year 's annual microbrewery conference in Portland .
Meanwhile , public offerings are proliferating in the industry , with recent ones coming from a chain of brewpubs in Colorado and from microbreweries in Pennsylvania and California .
Perhaps the most aggressive -- an unapologetic -- new player , however , is Mr. Bernau , a University of Oregon business graduate and former head of the Oregon chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business .
After a Portland weekly newspaper dubbed him `` Microbrew 's Bad Boy '' a few weeks ago , he and his staff showed up at a local brewing festival in black T-shirts that read `` We Bad .
'' They also ran the Jolly Roger up the flagpole at their brewery .
Before launching his beer venture , Mr. Bernau found success in the Oregon wine industry .
In 1989 , he formed Willamette Valley Vineyards Inc. to build a winery , and sold stock to the public from booths he set up at wine festivals and local fairs .
In offerings in 1991 and 1992 , the winery raised nearly $ 4 million for expansion .
Using ideas he says he developed while running a student-owned tavern in college , he encouraged his 3,000 stockholders to think of themselves as owner-consumers .
Some helped with the grape harvest , bottling and packaging , while others delivered wine in their own vans -- all as volunteers .
Today , the company sells more wine in Oregon than any other Oregon winery .
In 1993 , Mr. Bernau turned his attention to beer .
He sold about 53 % of the stock in Willamette Valley Brewing to the public for $ 2.4 million , this time using newspaper and radio ads allowed under new Securities and Exchange Commission `` testing the waters '' rules .
Although he wanted to sell only 49 % of the stock , he says , the offering was oversubscribed and investors demanded access to more shares .
In addition to soliciting production and marketing help from his shareholders , Mr. Bernau gave shares of stock in the brewery to his distributors ' employees as an incentive to sell the beer .
`` This combination of consumer and equity holder , '' he says , `` is an unbelievably powerful concept .
'' Mr. Bernau is now selling a second offering in Willamette Valley Brewing , as well as shares in new ventures in other states .
Shares in his enterprises are n't offered on any exchange , but are traded among individual stockholders using a company-provided list of interested buyers .
Even so , more than 7,500 callers responded to ads for Mile High Brewing Co. shares in Denver , says the planned brewery 's general manager , Ron Smith .
Willamette Valley Brewing 's shares do n't pay dividends , and its prospectus warns shareholders that it wo n't pay them anytime soon .
But the brewery had a small profit in the first quarter of this year , after only five months of operation , and net income in June of $ 48,481 on sales of $ 220,860 .
Shares in the secondary offering have sold for $ 4.20 , up from the $ 1.20-a-share price that original investors paid in the first offering .
Mr. Bernau is likely to profit handsomely from his brewery deals .
He paid only six cents a share for each of his 1.6 million shares in Willamette Valley Brewing -- a 40 % stake .
And he 'll retain about 84.6 % of the shares of his new microbrewery holding company , Willamette Valley Inc. , for $ 100,000 , or about 3.3 cents a share .
Shares in the holding company are selling to the public for $ 1.72 apiece .
However , he points out , his shares go into escrow until the company is profitable for an extended period .
`` The shares I hold have no value until the company performs , '' he says .
As for the stock he 's selling , Mr. Bernau says that profit is n't everything to his investors : `` Our business is fun and exciting .
A lot of our shareholder motivation is more than pure economic interest .
'' As the nation tries to push medical costs down , a growing group of entrepreneurs is advising doctors on how to bring their charges up .
Lynne Northcutt , a 45-year-old nurse , started HCP Consultants Inc. , in Castle Rock , Colo. , last April .
She combs through patient records , searching for unbilled charges .
One practice , Ms. Northcutt recalls , never billed for drawing blood for lab work .
That discovery alone should boost the practice 's annual reimbursements by $ 40,000 , she says .
In return for such detective work , her business is earning monthly revenue of $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 .
There 's a flip side to the nation 's drive to contain soaring medical costs : Doctors are determined to protect their incomes .
Consequently , demand for these consulting services is booming .
Health-industry analysts estimate that the number of firms offering advice about boosting reimbursements and negotiating better terms with managed-care providers has doubled to more than 600 in the last five years .
Headed by former hospital administrators , nurses , medical technicians , insurance-claims processors , employees of managed-care companies and accountants , the firms charge anywhere from $ 125 an hour to $ 5,000 a day .
Some deal only with certain medical specialties .
Some of the medical consultants are coming under attack from professional organizations , insurers and consumer advocates , who raise ethical questions about maximizing reimbursements .
Boosting charges `` inflates the cost of health care , raises insurance premiums and contributes to the problems of the uninsured , '' says Arthur Levin , director of the nonprofit Center for Medical Consumers .
Nevertheless , clients are grateful .
Last year , Charles Spenler , a plastic surgeon in Torrance , Calif. , was wondering whether he might be forced out of business .
In four years , his practice 's reimbursements had fallen precipitously , his overhead had shot up and his pretax income had dropped 40 % to $ 150,000 , he says .
Desperate , he hired Debra Dorf , a consultant from KarenZupko & Associates , a small Chicago firm .
She located the profit drain : His contract with a managed-care group of 70,000 members .
Terms called for him to be paid more than $ 200,000 a year to see patients , many on referral .
The trouble was , Dr. Spenler says , he kept getting low-fee referrals , such as sewing up minor facial cuts for $ 350 .
He could n't refuse the work , he says , because the managed-care group would have docked his fee .
As a result , he did n't have enough time to concentrate on high-fee procedures for private patients , such as surgery to correct a hand deformity that can cost up to $ 2,000 .
At Ms. Dorf 's suggestion , Dr. Spenler renegotiated his contract so that he is paid for services , instead of on a per-member basis .
His contract revenue remains the same , but he sees fewer patients and his income is holding steady , he says .
`` I do n't think I could have stabilized it without Debra , '' he says .
For some physicians , the solution can be simple : Raise prices .
Last year , Philadelphia consultant Evelyn Eskin went through the records of a small family practice in Morton , Pa. , and concluded that it was fulfilling Medicare requirements to the letter but was often charging far below Medicare maximums .
`` We were too timid in billing , '' acknowledges Ronald D'Orazio , one of the doctors .
For instance , in the old days , if a patient came to see Dr. D'Orazio for hypertension and then also complained of a cold during the visit , the practice would bill Medicare $ 23.24 for a relatively straightforward visit that Medicare categorizes as `` Level 2 .
'' Now , depending on the complexity of the problem , the practice might bill Medicare $ 33.32 for a `` Level 3 '' visit or even $ 51 for a `` Level 4 '' visit , he says .
Critics say the consultants sometimes give bad advice .
The American Medical Association , for example , has a `` very guarded and dim view '' of consultants who promise to `` maximize '' or `` optimize '' doctors ' reimbursments , says Barry Eisenbery , director of the American Medical Association 's division of payment policy .
The association often gets calls from physicians who have made a claim based on a consultant 's suggestion , only to have it rejected by Medicare , Mr. Eisenbery says .
`` These consultants are pretty slick , '' adds Gary Kavanagh , deputy director at the federal Health Care Financing Administration , in Baltimore , Md. .
He says he believes the consultants are constantly figuring out new ways `` to manipulate the system , '' so the government is forced to keep changing the way it screens claims .
In marketing their services , medical consultants say they take critics ' objections into account .
`` Reimbursement consultation is not just a financial service , '' says Norman Brooks , a consultant in Naperville , Ill. , adding that consultants have to factor ethical concerns into their recommendations .
Mr. Brooks recently gave a seminar to a group of doctors and administrators at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics .
Though the university 's cardiology practice had been struggling with reduced reimbursements , the doctors worried whether boosting charges would mean bigger bills for patients who pay directly for medical care .
Mr. Brooks , however , reassured the group that increasing their reimbursements from Medicare or private insurance companies might make it possible for them to reduce fees for self-pay patients .
`` We were happy to hear that he was sensitive about that , '' says Michael Winniford , director of the university 's cardiac catheterization laboratory .
One day after affirming its support of a merger with Viacom Inc. , Blockbuster Entertainment Co. defended the combination in the face of stinging shareholder criticism and declines in the prices of both companies ' stocks .
In a tense conference call to discuss the merger , investors charged that Viacom is paying too little for the video-rental chain and argued that Blockbuster has better growth potential on its own .
`` If I had the proxy today , I would vote ` no ' and FedEx it immediately .
'' said one irate shareholder .
Investor distress over the combination sent Blockbuster shares spinning yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange .
Blockbuster fell to $ 26.50 a share , down $ 1.375 , in composite trading .
On the American Stock Exchange yesterday , Viacom Class B common stock slipped to $ 34.50 a share , down 75 cents .
Some Viacom investors worry that the merger , by flooding the market with new Viacom shares , will put pressure on Viacom 's stock price .
Blockbuster president Steven Berrard seemed stunned by the attacks and stressed how the $ 7.6 billion deal would benefit shareholders .
`` The marketplace does not understand how valuable an entity this is , '' he said , stressing how the companies are worth more together than they would be separately .
The proposed combination would create a giant entertainment conglomerate with movie studios , music and video stores , theme parks and cable networks including MTV , VH-1 and Nickelodeon .
Late Tuesday , Blockbuster management , led by Chairman Wayne Huizenga , affirmed its support for the merger and agreed to put the issue to a shareholder vote on Sept. 29 .
Blockbuster also announced that its financial adviser , Merrill Lynch & Co. , agreed the combination was fair to shareholders .
The actions appeared to end months of uncertainty over whether Blockbuster -- upset over the decline in Viacom 's stock price since the deal was struck in January -- would try to kill the merger .
Although Blockbuster insiders have committed to voting their 23 % stake in favor of the merger , their endorsement was considered crucial in swaying shareholders to vote for the combination .
For the merger to occur , a majority of Blockbuster 's shares must be voted in favor of the deal .
Given that 23 % of the shareholders are already committed , only about one in three of the remaining votes is needed .
So unless Viacom 's stock takes a plunge , dragging Blockbuster 's stock price down with it , it appears the deal will succeed , analysts say .
`` If Viacom stock goes down to $ 30 , they could have some real problems , '' said one trader .
`` But with Viacom at the current level , I think it happens .
'' Blockbuster officials said yesterday they would continue to monitor Viacom 's stock price and might rethink their endorsement if Viacom 's stock tumbles before the shareholder vote .
Although Blockbuster 's stock price fell yesterday in reaction to management 's endorsement of the merger , one class of Viacom 's bonds rose sharply .
The 8 % bonds maturing in 2006 rose 5.125 points , or $ 51.25 for each $ 1,000 of face amount , rising to $ 817.50 from $ 766.25 .
If the Blockbuster deal falls through , the bonds convert to preferred stock that pays only 5 % , which would make them worth only about $ 650 , traders say .
The bonds also got a boost yesterday from Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group , which put Viacom 's debt on watch with positive implications .
S&P cited the improved cash flow that would result from the Blockbuster merger .
Access to Blockbuster 's massive cash flow is the major reason Viacom wants the company .
The money would help pay debt associated with Viacom 's purchase of Paramount Communications Inc. .
The terms of the Blockbuster merger agreement call for Viacom to issue Blockbuster holders a package of Viacom securities .
Based on Viacom 's stock price yesterday , Blockbuster shareholders would receive securities worth between $ 27.50 and $ 28 for each of their Blockbuster shares .
In the conference call , Blockbuster shareholders also expressed concern about the ill-defined role of current Blockbuster management in the new entity .
Mr. Berrard said top executives were offered three-year contracts to remain with the new company and indicated Mr. Huizenga would serve as vice chairman and a board member .
But , Mr. Berrard added , `` It 's not fair to say Wayne 's going to do this forever ; but he 's not going to ride off into the sunset and leave this thing behind .
'' Mr. Berrard said his own role is still being negotiated .
WASHINGTON -- The last time a tidal wave of Cuban rafters headed for U.S. shores , Gov. Bill Clinton got burned by Fidel Castro .
Now , the two are clashing again -- and the wily Cuban leader may have left President Clinton with no easy way out .
With each passing day , it becomes increasingly clear that nothing the world 's only superpower has done is stopping the outpouring of emigrants heading from the impoverished island toward the U.S. Ironically , although it is Mr. Castro whose regime appears to be on the ropes , it is Mr. Clinton who for now seems to have no good options .
The president could take more severe steps to pressure Cuba to stop the flow , either with a naval blockade or some other kind of military action .
But that seems risky against the second-largest army in the Western Hemisphere .
Or he could go the soft route -- which Havana yesterday signaled it is angling for -- by loosening the economic embargo against Cuba and opening negotiations with Mr. Castro .
But negotiating under the gun to end the embargo , the main fixture of the U.S. 's policy toward Cuba since the early 1960s , is at best fraught with political risk .
Mr. Clinton also could try to absorb the massive wave of Cubans , as President Carter did in 1980 , by housing them in U.S. detention centers .
But Mr. Clinton himself remembers painfully how he paid a high political price when he accepted some of those refugees in Arkansas , and riots followed .
So , Mr. Clinton chose the only course that appears palatable to him : His administration announced yesterday that it will double the absorption capacity at the U.S. Naval facility in Guantanamo Bay , in Cuba itself , and keep funneling the boat people there .
Guantanamo will be expanded so it can house 40,000 Cuban and Haitian refugees .
What is more , Defense Secretary William Perry declared : `` We have significant capacity beyond that and we will expand beyond that , if necessary .
'' The upshot is this : Mr. Clinton is going to grit his teeth and stick with his decision last week to bar Cubans from the U.S. , altering a 28-year-old policy .
That means the confrontation with Mr. Castro is likely to continue for some time .
For the time being , politically powerful members of the Cuban-American community have applauded Mr. Clinton 's tough stance of not bargaining with the Castro government , even though the policy of sending Cuban refugees to Guantanamo has set off a firestorm of controversy in Miami .
`` Let 's see who blinks first , '' says Francisco J. Hernandez , the president of the Cuban American National Foundation , referring to the Cuban government .
`` We are not going to blink first .
'' To be sure , the U.S. expects some relief from several Caribbean and other Latin American nations expected to offer havens for several thousand Cubans .
But for now , the absorption capacity of these countries looks insufficient compared with the numbers of fleeing Cubans .
As a result , Mr. Clinton seems to be betting on a last stand at Guantanamo , hoping that will hold until the flow subsides .
A Pentagon spokesman says the Defense Department is preparing to call up selected reserve units to get enough cooks , logistical-support experts , medical people and security forces to handle the expanding population there .
In Miami , a joke making the rounds is that the city 's Arquitectonica architectural firm , of `` Miami Vice '' fame , has been hired to build high rises in Guantanamo .
But conditions are no laughing matter at the naval facility , already crowded with 15,000 Haitian boat people who have been joined by 2,000 Cubans -- with 7,000 more on the way .
Earlier this week , the Haitians , resentful that they have never been treated as equals of the Cubans , demonstrated angrily when their customary orange juice was missing from breakfast .
Mr. Castro could quickly make conditions worse at Guantanamo by removing the Cuban troops from his side of the fence and permitting Cubans to arrive at the U.S. facility by land .
Yesterday , in a White House briefing , Secretary Perry warned against such action , saying the administration `` would regard this as being an unfriendly act toward the United States and would take appropriate actions .
'' Even Sen. Bob Graham , a Florida Democrat , says Mr. Clinton 's policy has risks .
For one , he says that crowding so many people into Guantanamo , with no promise they will reach the U.S. , could `` create tensions '' in the camp .
And he worries that a long stalemate could lead to an uproar among Cuban-Americans about their Cuban compatriots .
And if Guantanamo were to become a tinderbox , Mr. Clinton would relive one of his darkest moments .
That nightmare took place in 1980 , during the giant Mariel boat lift of Cubans , when then-Gov .
Clinton of Arkansas responded to an urgent request from President Carter .
To relieve the burden on Florida , Mr. Clinton agreed to allow Fort Chaffee , an Army base that had once housed German prisoners of war and Vietnamese boat people , to be used to detain up to 25,000 Cubans .
Many of them were criminals , some sporting distinctive prison tattoos between their thumbs and forefingers that identified them as thieves or killers .
Beginning in June , problems at the facility came to a head , as rioting refugees burst through the gates , tossing stones at police and setting fires in the streets .
Fights erupted between the Cubans and Ku Klux Klansmen who were taunting them .
Mr. Clinton 's election opponent , Frank White , led the chorus of angry citizens who asked why this mess was allowed to happen in their state -- and the youthful Mr. Clinton went down in defeat .
-LRB- Two years later , he recovered and won back the governor 's office , which he kept until he was elected president .
-RRB- `` In 1980 , Clinton was burned .
There 's no question that it 's not an abstract question for him , '' says Sen. Christopher Dodd , a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs .
Adds Skip Rutherford , a Clinton friend who in 1980 worked for Arkansas Sen. David Pryor : `` He is aware of the political impact at the state and local level .
This can crystallize at the state level as a major political issue .
It was a major factor in his defeat .
'' At a minimum , Clinton friends and advisers say , that experience has made the president extremely sensitive to the problems faced by Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles , a Democrat who now also faces a re-election campaign while having to worry about an influx of Cuban refugees .
Although the notion of housing the Cubans in detention facilities in the U.S. once was discussed by the administration , it was rejected several weeks ago , shortly after the flow of Cubans began .
Initially , administration officials examined `` Operation Distant Shore , '' a contingency plan that was designed to cope with emergencies like Mariel , during which 125,000 Cubans flooded Florida .
Under the plan , Cubans would have been placed in facilities across the U.S. to reduce the burden on Florida .
An official says that the administration also examined a modified version of the plan , but rejected that as well .
Of course , Mr. Clinton 's searing 1980 experience is n't the only reason the administration refuses to permit Cuban rafters to land here .
U.S. officials argue that continuing the old policy would unleash another wave of Mariel proportions .
Given Cuba 's collapsing economy , the prospect of three meals a day in a U.S. detention facility may be more attractive than remaining at home .
As a result , the consistent message from Washington to Cubans has been : Stay home .
Nobody will be admitted to the U.S. `` There will be no Cubans coming from Guantanamo to the United States , either to federal facilities or to any other place , '' Attorney General Janet Reno emphasized at a White House briefing yesterday .
Nevertheless , the rafters keep coming .
Earlier this summer , the administration was able to shut off the flow of Haitian boat people by barring entry to the U.S. Officials thought the same approach would work with the Cuban rafters , but so far the policy has failed .
That 's because there have been only a handful of occasions during Mr. Castro 's decades-long reign when he has briefly permitted unfettered emigration -- and unhappy Cubans want to take advantage of the opportunity regardless of Washington 's pronouncements .
Meanwhile , as Mr. Clinton focuses on containing the crisis by housing Cubans at Guantanamo , Mr. Castro is acting as if he were the one holding the winning hand .
At the United Nations yesterday , Cuba 's ambassador , Fernando Ramirez de Estenoz Barciela , said that the only way to stanch the flow of Cubans is for Washington and Havana to hold direct talks on lifting the economic embargo .
The envoy warned that imposing more sanctions on Cuba 's crippled economy would only prompt more Cubans to flee the island .
But U.S. officials are slamming the door on high-level talks with Cuba .
`` We see nothing to be gained from the kind of talks '' that Cuba is calling for , says Peter Tarnoff , undersecretary of state for political affairs .
`` There are no easy solutions , '' says Dee Dee Meyers , the White House press secretary .
She adds that the U.S. is dealing with a `` difficult situation , '' and that expanding the facilities at Guantanamo and searching for havens offers the best solution .
Indeed , at least for the moment , there seems to be little political risk in Mr. Clinton 's decision to deal with Cuba with the stick rather than the carrot .
There is n't any domestic political pressure for negotiations with Mr. Castro , one of the Cold War 's few remaining relics .
And there is little likelihood that the administration would negotiate with Cuba in the midst of a crisis .
Rather , the U.S. is relying on absorbing the flow of refugees from the tension in both Cuba and Haiti and waiting for Mr. Castro to fall .
The State Department 's Mr. Tarnoff said at a White House briefing yesterday that the U.S. expects to shortly conclude an agreement with the Turks and Caicos Islands to open a safe haven , and that the construction of a safe haven for Haitians already is under way in Suriname .
The U.S. is discussing using those facilities for Cubans as well as Haitians .
Further , Panama 's president-elect , who assumes office Sept. 1 , has indicated that his country is prepared to absorb a substantial number of Cubans .
Of course , the current exodus and the standoff with the U.S. pose risks for Mr. Castro as well .
Analysts say he runs the risk both of steadily losing internal control and of deepening the country 's economic crisis , because Mr. Clinton has turned the screws harder by cutting off the flow of dollars from expatriate Cubans .
U.S. officials say the move is designed to deprive Cuba 's economy of about $ 500 million annually in badly needed hard currency .
Only last month , after a disastrous sugar harvest , Mr. Castro told a radio audience : `` Our struggle is not sufficient .
Our results are not sufficient .
'' Then he asked : `` How can we withstand this ?
Will we ourselves destroy the revolution ?
'' Analysts say the crisis in Cuba could be wreaking havoc on the country 's two hopes for an economic revival : tourism and foreign investment .
While the crisis is taking a toll on the Cuban people , it also is affecting the Cuban ruling class .
A recent Spanish visitor to the island says a major in the all-powerful interior ministry recently inquired about getting political asylum in Spain .
According to the Spaniard , the Cuban told embassy officials that he was worried that he and his family would be killed in the violence to come .
Ramon Cernuda , who acts as a spokesman in Miami for one of Cuba 's most important human-rights organizations , says there is great frustration among many in the Cuban power structure over Mr. Castro 's policy of using emigration as a policy and `` bleeding the nation of its best sons , the ones who want to get ahead and do n't have the resources to do it within the country .
'' Mr. Cernuda adds : `` They are seeing that their sons and grandsons want to leave the country because they have no hope .
This erodes the power base , because it is the sons of the colonel , of the commandant , of the party secretary who want to leave .
'' For example , says Mr. Cernuda , in July an ill-fated attempt by a Cuban tugboat to escape the island was organized by a local Communist Party secretary and by the head of the local Communist Youth organization , who both drowned .
In that episode , about 40 people died after Cuban vessels rammed the ferry and sprayed it with high-pressure water hoses .
Oliver Stone has done it again .
He has cannily turned yet another of his movies into a cause celebre , good feed for the media he claims to despise -LRB- and loves to manipulate -RRB- .
The New Yorker , in a long profile , dutifully presented the bad-boy image Mr. Stone has so carefully cultivated , in a piece pegged to the debut of his new film , `` Natural Born Killers .
'' This week Newsweek devoted not one but two movie columns to the picture -- one adoring , one despising .
To help spark controversy , should one fail to arise , Mr. Stone has issued , along with the standard press materials , a dissertation on the roots and meaning of `` Natural Born Killers .
'' It is a highly entertaining document , written by Mr. Stone the scholar , not Mr. Stone the rogue .
Covering all bases , he describes his serial-killer picture as a `` Swiftian\/Volt-airian caricature '' of modern violence taking place in a `` Beavis and Butt-head 1990s American crimescape .
'' Of the lead characters in this movie that begins , ends and feeds throughout on images of brutality , Mr. Stone insists : `` I did not seek to dwell on or glorify their violence .
'' Then , he adds , hopefully , `` Although I will be accused of such .
'' I say `` hopefully '' because Mr. Stone must realize that part of the excitement of any Oliver Stone picture is the `` controversy '' that precedes it .
Remember the endless commentary fueled by `` JFK '' ?
And with this picture he needs all the external excitement he can muster , because `` Natural Born Killers '' is a mess .
A brilliant mess , I suppose , in the way that seriously disturbed people can sometimes deliver a briefly mesmerizing vision of the universe while babbling .
If nothing else -LRB- and there may , indeed , be nothing else -RRB- , `` Natural Born Killers '' is the most in-your-face movie ever released by a major Hollywood studio -LRB- Warner Brothers -RRB- .
The images fly by like MTV on overdrive , now in black-and-white , now in color , and there is no logical explanation for the abrupt changes -LRB- such as shifting point of view -RRB- .
The narrative , such as it is , is constantly interrupted by flashes of violence from somewhere else -- footage of Stalin and Hitler appear through a motel-room window , ominous close-ups of insects and animals doing nature 's violence fill the screen .
Added to all that is a cacophonous soundtrack roaming across more than five dozen pieces of music , a wide-ranging collection that includes snippets from Patti Smith 's `` Rock and Roll Nigger '' as well as Puccini 's `` Madama Butterfly .
'' It is possible , I suppose , to take the picture 's wildly impressionistic approach as an accurate reflection of what seems to be Mr. Stone 's vision of contemporary violence -- as a perversion of what he calls `` natural violence .
'' The main perverters , in his view , are the media , which by glorifying violence and criminals have erased the moral distinction between man and animal .
Or , as Mickey , one of the `` Natural Born Killers , '' tells the host of a tabloid TV show : `` You 're the one who made it -LCB- violence -RCB- impure ... buying and selling .
'' It 's not an especially new idea but it 's provocative -- or would be if `` Natural Born Killers '' did n't come off as a chorus of primal screams .
You walk out of the theater feeling numb , not from the violence -LRB- which , though abundant , is oddly abstract -RRB- but from sensory overload .
Supposedly that is the same sensory overload that has driven Mickey and Mallory -LRB- Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis -RRB- , the `` heros '' of `` Natural Born Killers , '' to kill 52 people in three weeks .
`` Too much TV , '' flashes a sign on their torsos during one of many hallucinatory moments .
However , anyone familiar with Mr. Stone 's body of work will quickly sense that `` Natural Born Killers '' is n't really a study of the forces shaping Mickey and Mallory .
Rather , the film feels like an extended stay inside Mr. Stone 's own feverish imagination , an imagination formed by intelligence , yes , but also extensive drug use , Hollywood paranoia and celebrity egoism .
Strange , how so many of the images supposedly fueling Mickey and Mallory 's nihilism happen to relate to Mr. Stone 's own movies : snakes from `` The Doors , '' references to Vietnam and `` JFK , '' actual footage from `` Scarface '' and `` Midnight Express '' -LRB- for which he wrote the screenplays -RRB- .
Mr. Stone describes the film as a `` parody , '' presumably to explain the frantic pace , the fragmented story and the hyperactive performances .
Though Ms. Lewis and Mr. Harrelson become eerily believable portraits in amoralism , you can see the sweat on everyone else , as Mr. Stone pushes every scene to the limit .
If this is parody it 's sadly sophomoric , coming from a filmmaker with Mr. Stone 's talent and stature .
I 'm thinking especially of the mock sitcom that explains Mallory 's murderous bent .
It 's a `` Leave It to Beaver '' version of a `` dysfunctional '' family , with Mallory constantly fighting the clutches of her incestuous dad -LRB- Rodney Dangerfield -RRB- .
Or , consider the `` parody '' in this scene : Mickey and Mallory are relaxing in a motel room between killings .
As Mickey idly flips through the cable universe , catching bits of `` Scarface '' and `` Midnight Express , '' he complains that Hollywood does n't make love stories anymore .
Mallory climbs on top of him and they begin to make love -LRB- this is when the images of Hitler and Stalin start racing by the window -RRB- .
Only then does the camera pull back to let us see there 's a witness , a terrified young woman -LRB- who 's sexy and stripped to a shirt and panties -RRB- bound and gagged in the corner of the room .
The next victim .
Sound familiar ?
It should .
Hundreds of California companies , turned off by their state 's high costs and burdensome regulations , have shopped the nation in recent years , looking for a new home .
And Texas has emerged as one of the hottest destinations .
According to a 1992 survey of 1,000 manufacturers that had expanded or relocated out of California since 1980 , 9.4 % chose Texas , followed closely by Nevada , which captured 9.2 % .
The survey , prepared for Southern California Edison Co. , found that California 's other neighbors , Arizona and Oregon , lagged far behind -- at 6.1 % and 3.5 % , respectively .
Moreover , it is n't only the state 's biggest cities that have been attracting West Coast malcontents : Many of Texas ' smaller cities have launched the most aggressive , and successful , efforts .
`` The competition among cities and counties in Texas has increased dramatically , '' says Waco Chamber of Commerce President Jack Stewart .
This year has seen a slight slowdown in the torrent of businesses leaving California , as recession-strapped companies have become reluctant to cough up cash for a move or expansion .
But Texas cities continue to focus as much as 50 % of their recruiting efforts on the West Coast .
`` I feel there is real promise in the California marketplace , '' says Dan Seal , a marketing executive at the Greater Houston Partnership .
Why Texas ?
California companies cite a host of economic reasons , including lower labor , operating and living costs , friendly regulators and a lack of a statewide personal income tax .
Texas is centrally located between the East and West coasts , and is close to growing Mexican markets .
And a high quality of life , including mild winters reminiscent of California , adds to the allure .
For Powell Clinton , president of Fuel Harvesters Inc. , a maker of recycling equipment , the low cost of living in Midland was a key factor in his decision to move in late 1990 from Green Valley , Calif. , where the least-expensive houses go for about $ 125,000 .
`` We could n't afford to pay enough for our employees to afford to live there , '' he says .
`` We had employees living in trailers .
'' Fuel Harvesters has had few employee-recruitment problems in Midland , a city full of skilled workers laid off from the petroleum industry .
Another reason so many companies have chosen Texas is that state personalities , from Gov. Ann Richards to former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach , have `` done a remarkable job of selling the idea that Texas businesses have lower costs , and that the state provides a good value , '' says Barry Sedlik , manager of business retention at Southern California Edison , which stands to lose customers each time a business leaves the area .
`` This is of the greatest concerns to California , and we really need to pay attention .
'' While Texas government officials downplay the suggestion that they are `` raiding '' California , it 's hard to call it anything else .
Direct mail , telemarketing , trade shows and industry-specific advertising -- all of it is used by the states and individual cities in an effort to lure unhappy California companies .
Incentives , ranging from local and county property-tax abatements to outright payment of a company 's relocation costs , are increasingly available for West Coast prospects .
In addition , local authorities help businesses tap into state incentives , such as job-training programs and tax abatement in enterprise zones .
Many of the biggest prizes have gone to the state 's biggest cities -- in particular , Dallas , Houston and Austin .
Austin , fast rivaling California 's Silicon Valley as a technology center , has lured dozens of companies with its university-educated work force and advanced telecommunications network .
Houston , seeking to replace jobs lost with a decline in the oil industry , has successfully pitched the proximity of the Johnson Space Center .
And in the Dallas area , the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport is a big selling point .
Transamerica Insurance Group , looking to move its national support center to a central time zone , recently settled on Irving , because of the greater Dallas area 's well-educated work force and low costs of doing business .
Another deciding factor was the airport , says a company spokeswoman .
`` We want our executives to be able to take daily trips and be back in the office the same day , '' she says .
The insurer , owned by TIG Holdings Inc. , plans to bring 1,200 jobs to the region by spring -- making it one of Texas ' largest California recruits .
Again , though , it 's the smaller cities that have gone to some of the most extraordinary lengths to woo companies .
For instance , when an outdated Midland zoning code menaced Christopher Jacobs 's plan to move his tiny electronics plant to a Midland site , the city 's mayor hand-delivered a letter that all but promised the regulation would soon be history .
Then the mayor bought Mr. Jacobs lunch .
That would n't have happened in Los Angeles , says Mr. Jacobs , who packed up and moved his Jacobs Electronics Inc. to Midland in April 1991 after two decades of doing business in California .
Moreover , while such cities as Dallas plan occasional star-studded delegations to California , Amarillo , population 192,000 , has taken the on-site recruitment concept one step further .
The city 's Economic Development Corporation sends staffer Kirk Folkner to live two weeks each month in a rented apartment in Irvine , Calif. , so he can get close to the action .
And , with $ 7.5 million each year in economic-development money funded by a half-percent sales tax , Amarillo can also afford to offer other incentives .
`` We can do anything except buy a company , '' boasts Mr. Folkner , who is planning a direct-mail campaign .
Amarillo 's aggressive marketing campaign , begun in January , has n't lured any California companies yet , but four manufacturers plan visits soon , he says .
While Midland does n't send anyone to live in California , it does blanket the state with direct-mail pitches .
The city 's Chamber of Commerce this summer attracted a company that makes modular barns with its mailing , and hosted three visits from prospects in June , says Janna King , who recently stepped down as Chamber president .
What 's in the letter ?
Citing competitive pressures from other communities , Ms. King wo n't release its contents .
`` You do n't give away any secrets you do n't need to , '' she says .
But Midland 's success with direct mail seems to be the exception rather than the rule .
Mario Hernandez , president of the San Antonio Economic Development Foundation Inc. , says direct advertising helps enhance the city 's image , but rarely nets immediate results when companies `` actually get ready to form a list '' of possible locations .
What works best , say recruited companies , is good service once they call a community for information .
Texas cities , selling themselves not just against Colorado Springs or Reno but also against each other , are all-too-aware that victory may go to the chamber of commerce that jumps more quickly to serve a potential client .
Austin , for instance , does no advertising , no direct mail and no telemarketing , says Angelos Angelou , the city 's vice president of economic development .
`` We just answer the phone when it rings , '' he says .
But when the phone rings , Austin Chamber of Commerce employees jump .
From researching successful sites to talking to employees about relocation , Austin spares no effort to show companies how helpful they are -- and will be once they relocate .
At several companies ' request , Mr. Angelou 's office lobbied American Airlines , successfully , to start up direct service between Austin and two California cities , Los Angeles and San Jose .
Another example : Austin and San Antonio were both on the short list for Michael Angelo 's Gourmet Foods Inc. 's expansion .
The Vista , Calif. , company , which will have 200 workers in Texas by early next year , chose the Austin area partly because economic-development officials went to greater lengths to answer its inquiries than San Antonio did .
Larry Parker , a board member at the company , says : `` When I had some questions , they set me up for lunch with an official of the Texas Department of Commerce on a day 's notice .
'' Sometimes , though , it 's the small , intangible stuff that can seal a deal .
Just before Apple Computer Inc. decided to move its administration and customer support facility to Austin last year , the Chamber of Commerce faxed the company a humorous memo adapted from a Motorola Inc. advertisement : `` Gilbert without Sullivan .
Stop the Music .
Barnum without Bailey .
Quit Clowning ... Apple without Austin .
Does n't Compute .
'' James O'Neill , site director for Apple 's new Austin customer support division , says while Apple picked Austin mostly for its telecommunications infrastructure and the high quality of its work force , the Chamber 's follow-up `` conveyed a feeling of warmth and welcome that set it apart from other cities .
'' Companies that have moved or expanded into Texas since 1988 .
Note : The list includes relocations of California operations and expansions of California-based companies into Texas and the jobs they have created , or -- if they are still in the process of moving -- the jobs they will create by the end of 1994 .
Not included are expansions of companies that had operatons in Texas prior to 1988 , unless the local expansion involved relocating operations from California .

At a House Banking Committee hearing last month , Iowa Republican Jim Leach was ripping into a witness for `` false '' talk and `` straw-man arguments .
'' No , the hearing was n't about Whitewater .
It was about derivatives , Wall Street 's controversial , fastest-growing business -- and one of its hottest moneymakers .
What enraged Rep. Leach was a suggestion by a representative of a derivatives trade group that the Leach bill to tighten federal regulation of derivatives dealers could force banks to pay for clients ' financial blunders .
`` What section ?
'' Rep. Leach sputtered .
`` What title is this particular provision in ?
I mean , I and my staff wrote the bill .
I do n't recall putting it in ... That is a very powerful statement and one that is false .
'' Why do some arcane financial instruments stir up such a fuss ?
They are under attack at congressional hearings because of concerns about perceived regulatory lapses and in corporate boardrooms because of this year 's stunning losses from derivatives by some companies , mutual funds and even supposedly safe money-market funds .
The flood of red ink -- up to $ 6.4 billion since early 1993 , not counting losses at Piper Jaffray Cos. and some other companies whose total losses have n't yet been disclosed -- is frightening away many potential users .
Derivatives are n't going to disappear , however .
They are too important -- modern finance in its latest incarnation .
Yet members of Congress , fearful of a rerun of the savings-and-loan debacle , have proposed five different bills that would tighten regulation of dealers , both the banks and the securities firms .
And although few market-watchers expect Congress to pass derivatives legislation this year , the outlook could change abruptly .
The recent hue and cry has been set off mostly by exotic derivatives such as leveraged swaps , structured notes and kitchen-sink mortgage securities -- the kinds responsible for the spectacular losses -- even though they make up only about 2 % of the total derivatives market .
Most derivatives are plain-vanilla varieties used mainly to hedge risks rather than to speculate .
Such commodity-type arrangements , which include exchange-listed options and futures and privately traded forwards and swaps , have generally been spared criticism and continue unabated .
But their thin profit margins dismay dealers .
Exotic derivatives , by contrast , are the dealers ' big moneymakers .
After the cost of hedging , dealers say , a plain-vanilla swap with an underlying value of $ 100 million would typically earn less than $ 100,000 over five years for the dealer , but an exotic swap on that amount would earn more than 10 times as much on a fully hedged basis .
In 1993 , says Paul Spraos , publisher of the Swaps Monitor newsletter , several U.S. dealers made more than 50 % of their revenues in dollar-based swaps from exotics .
And it is these complex products , says Stephen Berman , an analyst at the NatWest Securities subsidiary of London-based National Westminster Bank PLC , that `` are harmed most by the bad publicity and the limited liquidity for those who invested in them .
'' Amid the fracas , Wall Street 's appeals for understanding are verging on the hysterical .
`` The concept of derivatives stems back at least to the Bible .
In Genesis , God began creation by separating light from darkness , '' wrote Andrew Davidson , the head of a derivatives research firm , in the American Banker recently .
`` Without too much hyperbole , to limit derivatives is to limit creation .
'' Meanwhile , big derivatives users and their advisers are carefully distancing themselves from the fray .
Corporate law firms are sending out advisories alerting clients to controls that they might want to impose on derivatives .
`` Oversight of Corporate Derivatives Activities : What Directors Should Know , '' a memo by Wachtell , Lipton , Rosen & Katz of New York , contains six questions directors should ask .
They range from ensuring that the board has laid out clear policies to knowing that qualified employees are in place .
The sheer size and highly leveraged nature of the derivatives market add fuel to the controversy .
Some of these financial arrangements , whose returns track , or `` derive '' from , changes in the value of some underlying stock , bond or other asset , have exploded in recent years .
The `` notional '' value of the derivatives market -- the value of the assets underlying the agreements -- is a mind-boggling $ 35 trillion , equal to nearly three-quarters of all the world 's stocks , bonds , money-market securities and currencies put together .
In a `` forward '' agreement to buy $ 1 million of bonds at a set price three months hence , for example , the notional value is $ 1 million , even if no money changes hands today .
The buyer of the contract gets the same gains and losses as someone who actually owns $ 1 million of bonds .
Because derivatives allow investors to make big market bets with little or no money down , they became popular during the 1991-93 bull market in bonds .
`` This is a market that grew in a world where interest rates only went one way , '' says Edward Kleinbard , a tax lawyer at Cleary , Gottlieb , Steen & Hamilton in New York .
Such bets backfired when interest rates abruptly reversed course and rose earlier this year .
That detonated huge losses at Procter & Gamble Co. and Askin Capital Management , among others , which had invested heavily in exotic derivatives .
At least temporarily , the whiz-bang business in the exotic products has nearly ground to a halt .
New issues of structured notes -- securities that contain complex derivatives -- have `` dropped to fairly close to nil , '' says Andrew Serotta , vice president and portfolio manager at Boston Co. , a unit of Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank Corp. .
Wall Street 's derivatives machine may be irreparably damaged if corporate clients permanently `` retreat to simpler , easier-to-value and far-less-profitable derivatives to manage their risks , '' NatWest 's Mr. Berman says .
Earnings of Bankers Trust New York Corp. , a major dealer , have already slumped on weak derivatives sales and trading results .
`` Say It Ai n't So '' was the title of a Merrill Lynch report on the bank 's disappointing second quarter .
To fend off any stifling legislation , the International Swaps and Derivatives Association , a trade group , has hired the premier Washington lobbying firm of Patton & Boggs .
And strange alliances have sprung up .
Federal regulators , government issuers , Wall Street dealers , corporations , mutual funds , consultants and capital-market pundits are all walking the same tightrope , defending derivatives and trying to forestall new regulations while shunning responsibility for the abuses .
Darcy Bradbury , a deputy assistant Treasury secretary , notes a `` substantial consensus '' of federal banking and securities regulators that additional regulation is n't necessary .
`` We do n't want to be locked into yesterday 's good idea , '' she adds .
The problem with legislation , says Douglas Harris , senior deputy comptroller at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , is that `` once it 's there , it 's writ in stone .
'' In today 's fast-moving markets , derivatives bring much-needed flexibility for managing risk , he says .
Moreover , some quasi-governmental agencies are major issuers of exotic derivatives -- and have been involved in some of the trouble .
Currency-linked notes and mortgage derivatives bearing agency imprimaturs have torpedoed some mutual funds and other investors in recent years .
U.S. agencies ' triple-A credit ratings mislead the unsophisticated , critics contend .
Investors `` may be seduced by the agency status ... into investing in these complex debt instruments without a proper appreciation of the underlying risk , '' says Aida Alvarez , executive director of the Office of Federal Housing Oversight .
This agency , which oversees the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. , is looking into the activities of those two big issuers of mortgage derivatives and structured notes .
Structured notes issued by federal agencies recently wiped out 25 % of the capital of one small community bank , Mr. Harris says .
Similar federal-agency derivatives were mainly responsible for the losses in money-market funds run by a unit of BankAmerica Corp. and other companies .
In July , the SEC responded by ordering money-market funds , which are n't supposed to put customer funds at risk , to sell the hazardous derivatives that they have used to pump up their stated yields at the cost of introducing hidden risks into their portfolios .
James Brickley , president of the financing office for the Federal Farm Credit Bank , whose derivatives were owned by the ill-fated BankAmerica fund , criticizes the SEC 's decision .
The funds `` ought to have the right to determine '' which investments are suitable .
The only way customers can avoid risk entirely , he says , `` is to buy a Treasury bill .
'' John Darr , manager of the office of finance at the Federal Home Loan Bank , the largest agency issuer of structured notes with about $ 56 billion outstanding , attributes that agency 's dependency on derivatives to `` a serious funding job '' it faces .
Shrugging off the money funds ' losses , he says it is generally up to dealers to determine whether the notes are suitable for their customers .
But he discerns , in recent weeks , `` a migration back to the more basic or simpler structures .
'' Like the federal issuers , banks and corporations that are big users of derivatives are trying to temper the backlash .
`` I do n't know how I could tell you how reluctant , how concerned my board of directors is every time the word ` derivatives ' is mentioned , '' John Logan , an executive vice president of First American Corp. of Nashville , Tenn. , lamented at a House hearing .
`` Within community banks , there is so much fear of derivatives right now , given the recent publicity and the regulatory stance , that it amounts to paranoia .
'' That is a problem , Mr. Logan added , because `` we need these instruments to better manage our risks .
'' One satisfied user of plain-vanilla derivatives is Betsy Glaeser , manager of capital markets at Mobil Corp. .
She says her group saved the Fairfax , Va. , oil giant $ 66 million from 1990 to 1993 `` as a result of my having heard the word ` swap ' in 1989 .
'' Mobil has more than $ 4 billion in interest-rate swaps to help manage its financing in various currencies , she adds .
Now , too fearful of derivatives , some companies may be unnecessarily raising their financing costs .
`` Banks that should be using derivatives are not ... because it has come to seem that there is something wrong with them , '' Mr. Logan said at the hearing .
Some investors boast that they touch only good , old-fashioned derivatives .
`` Due to the potential magnitude and uncertain nature of these risks , Vanguard portfolios have steered clear of exotic derivatives , '' John C. Bogle , chairman of the Vanguard Group of mutual funds , recently wrote customers in a newsletter .
He said he wants Vanguard funds to have `` relatively predictable and reasonably understandable investment characteristics .
'' What few defenders mention is that derivatives often enable a user to sidestep some rule or capital standard .
Banks , for example , like interest-rate swaps because they require less capital than a security with the same notional value .
Mutual funds can use structured notes to get around rules barring them from investing in currencies or commodities .
Some of Vanguard 's rivals , including PaineWebber Group Inc. and Piper Jaffray , bought derivatives to fatten the yields of `` safe '' short-term government bond funds , only to have the funds ' value plummet when rates rose .
Another striking case was the recent $ 67.9 million bailout of two BankAmerica money-market funds .
The bank 's Pacific Horizon Prime fund had used derivatives to inflate its yield to 3.22 % at a time when the average fund was yielding 2.93 % .
That extra bit of yield was enough to draw $ 15 billion in assets , making Pacific Horizon the largest institutional money fund as of May 1993 .
The derivatives producing this payout magic were structured notes , mostly issued by federal agencies .
As of Feb. 28 , the fund held $ 40 million of a note from the Student Loan Marketing Association -LRB- Sallie Mae -RRB- , which raises money for student loans .
The five-year note , maturing in March 1998 , carried a then-hefty interest rate of 4.5 % in its first year .
After that , the rate was to be reset quarterly by a formula : the higher of either 4.125 % or 50 % of the rate on 10-year Treasury notes plus 1.25 percentage points .
When the note was issued in March 1993 , the 4.5 % rate was 66 % higher than those offered by the average of similar taxable money funds .
But if interest rates shot up , the note 's coupon could move up only half as much , hurting its resale value .
That is what happened early this year .
Although BankAmerica routinely sends its fund shareholders reports listing its holdings , it did n't disclose that the Sallie Mae notes do n't mature until 1998 .
Instead , the reports listed the next quarterly reset date as the `` maturity date .
'' Nor did they give the formula for determining the rate , which could have alerted holders to the risks ; they merely gave the current rate .
In theory , the BankAmerica fund could have avoided a loss by holding the notes to maturity .
But because the fund had attracted so much `` hot money '' chasing the highest yield , it began to shrink drastically in late 1993 , when rising rates offered investors a better deal on short-term Treasury bills .
In a single month , between mid-September and mid-October , it shriveled to $ 7.5 billion from $ 12.6 billion .
The fund had to jettison some of the notes at a loss .
And BankAmerica injected $ 67.9 million into this and one other fund to keep the share prices from dropping below $ 1 .
A BankAmerica spokesman says that even though the notes were n't explained in reports to holders , the fund complied with all SEC rules and flagged the generic risk of such securities in its prospectus .
He adds that the holders did n't lose money .
But such episodes lead even proponents of derivatives to acknowledge some cases of misuse .
`` By selling structured notes to money-market funds , the industry runs the risk of inviting regulators to review our entire business , '' says Richard Deitz , a managing director at Credit Suisse Financial Products , a major derivatives dealer owned by CS Holding of Switzerland .
Van Kampen Merritt Cos. , in the latest mutual-fund consolidation , agreed to buy American Capital Management & Research Inc. from Travelers Inc. for $ 430 million .
The combined companies will have $ 38.5 billion in assets under management , including more than $ 32 billion in mutual funds .
Ranked by fund assets alone , the new company , to be named Van Kampen\/American Capital , would be the 16th-largest mutual-fund company in the U.S. , following Scudder Stevens & Clark and ahead of John Nuveen & Co. , according to Strategic Insight , a consulting firm in New York .
The merger is part of a wave of mutual-fund mergers as fund companies seek critical mass and broader product lines in the face of heavy competition .
Earlier this week , shareholders approved Mellon Bank Corp. 's acquisition of Dreyfus Corp. for $ 1.8 billion .
Kemper Corp. agreed to be bought for $ 2.7 billion by Conseco Inc. , which sought its mutual funds .
And Pacific Financial Asset Management , a unit of Pacific Mutual Life , is acquiring Thomson Advisory Group L.P. in a complex transaction valued at more than $ 1 billion .
Fund analysts say a driving force in the Van Kampen-American Capital combination is the sharp downturn in the bond market this year .
Fund investors have been fleeing bond funds of all types , including municipal-bond funds , the type that dominates the offerings from Chicago-based Van Kampen Merritt .
Van Kampen , which has little in the way of stock funds , has also had trouble selling new closed-end , or publicly traded , bond funds this year .
Houston-based American Capital 's attraction is that close to half of its assets are in stock funds , according to Financial Research Corp. in Chicago .
And stock funds are getting the most money from investors these days .
Closely held Van Kampen is currently 90 % - owned by Clayton Dubilier & Rice Inc. , a New York leveraged-buyout firm .
Travelers , a financial-services conglomerate in New York , will buy 4.9 % of the stock of the combined Van Kampen\/American Capital for $ 24 million , and `` may receive an option to acquire up to 5 % of additional equity , '' a statement from Clayton and Travelers said .
Don G. Powell , American Capital 's chairman and chief executive , will be chief executive of the combined firm .
The chairman will be Richard Braddock , a former president of Citicorp who joined Clayton as a principal in May .
The sale is expected to close around year end .
Clayton paid $ 415 million when it acquired Van Kampen from Xerox Corp. in late 1992 , a time of heavy investor demand for bond funds .
Van Kampen is paying `` a pretty full price '' for American Capital , said Jeffrey Lovell , an investment banker at Putnam Lovell Inc. in Manhattan Beach , Calif. .
The price for American Capital is about 2.6 % of its assets under management ; Mr. Lovell estimates that Van Kampen is paying at least 17 times net income for American Capital .
In comparison , T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. , a publicly traded fund group that is growing faster than American Capital , also sells for 17 times projected earnings , Mr. Lovell estimated .
Both Van Kampen and American Capital sell their mutual funds through brokerage firms and banks .
`` Both companies have faced market-share declines over the last several years , '' Mr. Lovell said .
`` This is clearly a move to boost the market presence of the combined entities .
'' With the exception of Merrill Lynch & Co. , the two firms have little duplication among their sales outlets .
Mr. Braddock said there is a `` modest overlap '' among the funds offered by the two firms .
Together , they have 50 funds .
After consolidating some funds , Mr. Braddock expects the combined company will still have more than 40 funds .
Investors in the two fund groups will probably benefit from access to a more diversified group of funds .
Investors transferring between funds in the same family typically do n't pay additional sales charges .
Some of the savings from consolidating back offices could also be passed along to investors as lower operating expenses in the funds .
Fund industry observers say American Capital 's stock funds have n't had the type of stellar performance in recent years that attracts lots of money .
Mr. Braddock said he hopes to improve the investment results , both of American Capital and of Van Kampen .
`` Our desire is to improve performance across the board , '' he said .
Travelers said it sold American Capital to get it out from under the shadow of Smith Barney Inc. , a Travelers subsidiary with a large mutual-fund family and its own broker sales force .
Jeffrey Lane , vice chairman at Travelers , said rival brokerage firms were n't eager to sell American Capital funds because they were in competition .
`` I think we were holding them back , '' Mr. Lane said .
Travelers expects a $ 40 million gain in the fourth quarter on the sale .
WASHINGTON -- President Clinton portrayed Senate moderates as trapped in an `` ideological box '' in their refusal to support his proposed cost controls on medical expenditures and a requirement that employers help pay for their workers ' insurance .
Without cost controls or an employer mandate , health-care reform becomes dependent on wasteful subsidies , the president said in a televised exchange from the White House with a B'nai B'rith audience in Chicago .
And the same lawmakers who criticize him for being too liberal , he said , end up `` getting into taxes and government regulation '' to come up with the resources needed to finance their own alternative reform plans .
`` The so-called moderate and conservative people are trying to find ways to raise money from people who are already doing their part to basically overly subsidize people who do n't have insurance and employers who could afford to pay , '' said Mr. Clinton .
'' ... And that is the nub of all of our other problems .
'' Among those difficulties , the president said , is the failure of moderates to include funding for a new Medicare prescription-drug benefit proposed by the administration .
And the thrust of Mr. Clinton 's argument was that the so-called mainstream coalition had misdirected its resources and failed to support `` desperately '' needed initiatives for the elderly .
The tone of Mr. Clinton 's remarks -- and the potent politics of the Medicare drug benefit -- demonstrate the gap that still exists between him and the moderates .
And the president 's comments could add to tensions in the Senate and make it that much harder for the Democratic leadership to find a compromise with the already nervous coalition .
Mr. Clinton 's prepared speech sounded an upbeat note on his domestic agenda , but then , in a question-and-answer period , he was asked about the impact of proposed savings from Medicare in the mainstream plan .
The mainstream group represents up to 20 Republican and Democratic moderates whose votes are pivotal to enactment of health-reform legislation this year .
As the debate has moved right , they have scaled back their plan , which still includes progressive market reforms but now offers far less to poor and working-class families to help them buy insurance .
A Democratic plan offered by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell would also require large savings from Medicare to help pay for subsidies for lower-income families , but the Mitchell bill is careful to preserve an estimated $ 95 billion for the drug benefit over the next 10 years .
By comparison , the mainstream coalition puts a higher priority on deficit reduction and would strike this funding entirely while proposing to cut as much as $ 250 billion from future Medicare expenditures .
In negotiations now , Mr. Mitchell has said that the issue must ultimately be decided on the Senate floor .
But such moderates as Sen. John Danforth -LRB- R. , Mo. -RRB- have been outspoken in their opposition to creating such a new entitlement program .
Within the coalition , there are still serious differences over accepting any compromises now that could lead to the group 's unraveling .
And some members , such as Sen. Robert Kerrey -LRB- D. , Neb. -RRB- , argue that the package should be brought to the floor intact , and effectively become the underlying bill for Senate debate .
This approach has been resisted by the Democratic leadership , and provoked a heated exchange between Sen. Dianne Feinstein -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- and Mr. Kerrey in a closed-door meeting yesterday .
Tempers appeared to have improved later in the day , but meetings between Mr. Mitchell and the moderates are n't expected to resume until tomorrow .
For all the criticism it has received from the left , the mainstream plan has yet to win substantial support from business .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said yesterday that the proposal is `` unacceptable '' as now written .
And though the plan goes far toward giving large multistate companies the flexibility they want from state regulation , these concessions have failed to draw support because of doubts about the underlying financing .
Although scarcely an ally of the administration , business concerns here echo some of Mr. Clinton 's concerns .
Large corporations are worried about proposed limits on their ability to deduct the costs of employer-paid health benefits for workers .
And there is a fear that the large Medicare savings could force doctors and hospitals to make up their costs by charging the private market more .
Those business interests that have been supportive of the president , such as the National Leadership Coalition for Health Care Reform , are openly critical of the mainstream plan .
And the organization yesterday joined more traditionally liberal groups affiliated with the labor-backed Health Care Reform Project in a letter condemning the Medicare cuts and emphasis on deficit reduction at the expense of universal coverage .
The timing and tone of Mr. Clinton 's remarks were all the more surprising since the White House seemed determined through the day to put the best picture on the health-reform outlook .
Harold Ickes , deputy White House chief of staff , called in reporters to say that the `` odds are still good '' for substantial legislation this year .
But his remarks show a disconnection with the grimmer reality in the Capitol .
`` We think , the administration thinks , there is the will and the time to get universal coverage enacted , '' said Mr. Ickes .
But remarks this week by House Speaker Thomas Foley suggest a much more incremental approach .
And in private discussions with St. Louis business executives this week , House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt reportedly signaled that he thinks a major reform bill is doubtful this year .
`` The main thing we must do is we must do something that will work , '' said Mr. Clinton himself .
`` And it will be better not to do anything at all than to adopt a program that would actually increase costs of health care and reduce coverage .
That 's what we do n't want to do .
'' Digital Equipment Corp. reached a preliminary agreement to sell its database software unit to Oracle Corp. for about $ 100 million , people familiar with the discussions said .
Separately , Digital sold its 7.8 % stake in Ing .
C. Olivetti & Co. for $ 140 million , winding down a largely failed alliance with the Italian computer maker .
The two actions should raise cash and bolster Digital 's balance sheet at a time when it faces expensive restructuring costs .
Though the company , based in Maynard , Mass. , had more than $ 1 billion in cash on hand at the end of its fiscal year July 2 , it faces large outlays for work-force reductions and is expected to post another loss for the fiscal first quarter ending Sept. 30 .
Oracle and Digital both declined to comment on a possible sale of the database business , which had revenue of about $ 75 million last year .
Digital 's Rdb relational database software was once one of the industry 's leading products and , along with Oracle 's own database software , helped fuel Digital 's explosive growth in the late 1980s .
Analysts said Digital discussed a possible sale with Oracle , Computer Associates International Inc. and other companies .
The unit was apparently no longer regarded as strategic as Digital struggled to rebuild itself around a core computer-systems business .
The expected move is a departure for Oracle , which has never made a major acquisition , said Rich Edwards , analyst with Robertson Stephens & Co. .
He called it a `` pre-emptive strike '' to keep rivals Sybase Inc. and Informix Corp. from going after Digital 's big customer base .
William Shattuck of Montgomery Securities said that Oracle , of Redwood City , Calif. , `` should be able to sell into that base many times the unit 's current annual revenue '' and estimated Digital could get $ 100 million or more for the unit .
But people familiar with the talks said that a letter of intent for the sale had not yet been signed .
Digital 's Olivetti stake was acquired in 1992 as part of a broad strategic agreement in which Olivetti agreed to use Digital 's Alpha chip in future products and build personal computers for Digital .
Olivetti won a big premium for the shares , getting $ 287 million from Digital for a total of 98.5 million shares then worth $ 84 million .
But the relationship never really took off .
Olivetti 's latest annual report discloses that last year the company got revenue of 125.3 billion lire -LRB- $ 80.2 million -RRB- from Digital -- but it bought products valued at only 9.9 billion lire from its U.S. partner .
Digital said yesterday it concluded that the relationship wo n't yield the revenue or profit that it had expected , and last month the company wrote off much of the premium value of the deal .
Olivetti continues to sell Alpha systems and that will continue , a Digital spokesman said .
But the volume of PCs made by Olivetti for Digital is declining as Digital now makes most of its own .
The write-down of the Olivetti investment was part of a $ 380 million write-down of intangible assets taken by Digital for its fiscal fourth quarter .
For the quarter , Digital had a net loss of $ 1.76 billion , or $ 12.64 a share .
In addition to the $ 380 million write-down , the company took a $ 1.5 billion restructuring charge to pay for plant closing and the cost of as many as 20,000 new layoffs .
Digital shares , rising sharply in the past month from their 52-week low of $ 18.25 , closed at $ 23 yesterday , up 12.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments was among the recent buyers , traders said , but this could n't be confirmed , and Fidelity declined to comment .
Separately , Fidelity yesterday said it reached agreement to buy a 350,000-square-foot Digital office building in Marlborough , Mass. .
Fidelity , which plans to set up a regional office at the site , did n't disclose a price , nor would Digital .
But people familiar with the property pegged the price at between $ 15 million and $ 20 million .
Also , Proteon Inc. , Westborough , Mass. , said Digital agreed to purchase the rights to use Proteon 's internet-working software for `` several million dollars .
'' Proteon did n't disclose the total value , saying that it included a payment stream extending over multiple quarters , subject to meeting certain requirements .

A New York legal recruiting company has been sued by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly discriminating on the basis of age and national origin .
The lawsuit against Barrister Referrals Ltd. stems from an investigation begun last year by the New York office of the EEOC into the hiring practices of law firms .
The suit was filed in federal court in Manhattan .
New York attorney Joel Klarreich , who represents Barrister , said the company denies all allegations of discrimination .
The EEOC initially focused its investigation on legal-recruiting companies .
But the center of the agency 's concern is the hiring system at law firms , specifically the practice of hiring groups of young associates directly out of law school while allegedly not considering older lawyers .
EEOC regional attorney James Lee would n't say whether additional suits are expected .

Greyhound Lines Inc. , yielding to its biggest shareholder , agreed to give it three seats on the Dallas-based company 's nine-member board .
The shareholder , Toronto investment firm Connor , Clark & Co. , which owns 18.3 % of Greyhound , said earlier this month that it was seeking the three board seats and the ouster of the bus company 's chief executive .
Days later , the CEO , Frank Schmieder , resigned .
A permanent successor has n't been named .
Greyhound this week offered Connor Clark two seats on the condition that the investment firm not press for additional management changes or contact current or former Greyhound employees , directors or suppliers .
Greyhound dropped those conditions in agreeing to give Connor Clark three seats .
Greyhound and Connor Clark said they agreed to cooperate in an effort to restore the carrier to profitability .
SYDNEY -- John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. , an Australian newspaper publisher that is 25 % - owned by Telegraph PLC of Britain , reported that its net income more than doubled to 185.7 million Australian dollars -LRB- US$ 136.8 million -RRB- in the fiscal year ended June 30 , from A$ 76.2 million a year earlier .

Herman 's Sporting Goods Inc. received court approval of its reorganization plan , allowing the retailer to emerge from bankruptcy-court protection next month .
Herman 's , which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors in March 1993 , said it expects to emerge as a closely held company controlled by management .
The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Trenton , N.J. , confirmed the plan at a public hearing , after creditors voted in favor of the plan .
The Carteret , N.J. , company 's secured and unsecured creditors , mainly sporting-goods vendors , landlords , employees and investors , will receive cash and stock valued at about 90 cents on the dollar under the plan , Herman 's said .
Claims totaled $ 208 million .
Herman 's has annual sales of $ 350 million and operates 103 sporting goods stores in the Northeast .
Webco Industries Inc. said it overstated net income for its fiscal second and third quarters because of flawed accounting software that led to understating rawmaterial costs .
The steel-tubing maker , which went public in December , placed Vice President and Chief Financial Officer John M. Lare on administrative leave , saying his staff misinterpreted data from the software .
A restatement of the results is likely to show a loss for the third quarter ended April 30 , the company said .
Webco said it priced certain products too low because of the understated costs , and may report operating losses for the fourth quarter ended July 31 and the current quarter .
Restated results for the second and third quarters combined may be as much as $ 1.6 million , or 25 cents a share , lower , the company said .

Should the Doctors Pay ?
Courtroom Television 's `` Trial Story '' offers the case of a 39-year-old Florida woman who had her breast removed following the diagnosis of cancer .
As this unfortunate soon discovered -- though not soon enough to prevent the surgery -- the pathology report was wrong ; the breast was n't cancerous .
The intrinsic drama of this story is drained by lifeless summaries , but the cast of defendants -- four doctors pointing fingers at one another -- is interestingly crowded .
Also interesting are the questions such cases raise about the capacities of juries -- especially in judging such matters as medical procedure -- and the intelligence of their awards .
Walter Cronkite serves as guide to the history of human evolution -- and a highly enthusiastic one he turns out to be .
The tone is easy , the narrative sprinkled with observations like `` we humans tend to think we 're pretty perfect '' and other such homey wisdom .

That data includes studies on the chimpanzee , an animal , according to lab tests , genetically very similar to man -- more even than to the gorilla .
In the first chapter , paleontologists hold forth on the lust for fossils , the excitement of a find , with a passion that is impressive .

Not the least interesting part of this sequence is the demonstration of such high-tech instruments as the scanning device that can show clear patterns of primitive cutting tools on animal bones .
Filmed in Europe , South Africa , Kenya , Israel and more , this survey of evolution goes a good way around the world -- a trip decidedly worth taking .

The Kennedy Center 's recent tribute to Mstislav Rostropovich , departing music director of the National Symphony Orchestra , was , not surprisingly , a musical one -- with performances by Isaac Stern , Jean-Pierre Rampal and Maxim Shos-takovitch , conducting the final portion of his father 's Symphony No. 5 .
But this was also one with a touch of burlesque thrown in -- as in the film clip of a party where a mincing Mr. Rostropovich dances poker-faced in a tutu , looking for all the world like Milton Berle in his prime .
Next came Mr. Stern , who carried on briefly in the comic vein before the program settled down to the business of the evening .
That included a performance of the final chorus of Prokofiev 's `` Alexander Nevsky , '' which brought tears to the eyes of the honored guest , a former Soviet dissident and exile .
For sheer power , though , nothing in this evening could equal the sight of Mr. Rostropovich racing down from his box -- as the bejeweled and formally dressed crowd jumped wildly in the aisles -- to conduct one of his favorite musical works , `` The Stars and Stripes Forever .
'' The elegant Kennedy Center audience quite lost their heads over this , and no one watching or listening will blame them .

BURBANK , Calif. -- Jeffrey Katzenberg , foiled in his desire to be named president of Walt Disney Co. , will leave the company when his contract expires at the end of next month .
The move ended a showdown that had been looming for a year , but was pushed into the spotlight in recent months by the death of Disney 's president and its chairman 's heart surgery .
The ultimate question was whether Disney Chairman Michael Eisner would agree to share power with his longtime protege , Mr. Katzenberg , or lose one of Hollywood 's top creative executives .
Yesterday morning , Mr. Eisner called Mr. Katzenberg into his office and made the decision final .
The two already had talked about a succession plan .
`` This was not about a job title , '' said Mr. Katzenberg in an interview .
`` It was about creating new opportunities for me and redefining our partnership .
Michael just could n't create those opportunities .
'' Mr. Katzenberg , 43 years old , has been chairman of the Walt Disney Studios for 10 years and largely responsible for revitalizing Disney 's near-dormant film-production arm .
He also has been credited with the huge creative and financial successes of Disney 's recent animated films including this summer 's blockbuster `` The Lion King .
'' Indeed , his filmed-entertainment unit has surpassed theme parks as the company 's leading revenue producer and fastest-growing area .
`` You have to do what you think is right for the company , '' Mr. Eisner said in an interview .
`` I would n't have chosen to do this , but Jeffrey wanted a position we did n't have here , and nothing else would satisfy him .
It did n't exist here , just as it did n't exist for Barry Diller at Fox .
'' Mr. Diller left News Corp. 's Fox unit several years ago when he could n't wield more power at what was essentially Chairman Rupert Murdoch 's company .
It was the quadruple-bypass heart operation that Mr. Eisner , 52 , underwent in June that brought the issue of succession to the fore , since Disney had n't named another executive to fill the position of president after the death in April of Frank Wells in a helicopter crash .
Mr. Katzenberg made no secret of the fact that he felt it was time to move up to a near-equal footing with Mr. Eisner .
Indeed , he raised the issue a year ago by accelerating his contract 's expiration .
Mr. Eisner appreciated Mr. Wells 's self-effacing ability to work in the background and clearly wanted Mr. Katzenberg to remain in the filmed-entertainment area .
Mr. Katzenberg was n't wellknown among the company 's directors , and some opposed naming him president , even at the risk of his departure .
`` The board 's position all along was to leave the decision to Michael , '' said Ray Watson , former chairman and head of the executive committee .
But he reflected a widely held view on the board when he added , `` Frank Wells 's job was a different kind of job , supportive of Michael .
We do n't need two Michael Eisners .
They do n't complement each other .
'' With Mr. Katzenberg 's departure , Disney said it is reorganizing its filmed entertainment business into two entities .
It named Joe Roth , one-time head of News Corp. 's Twentieth Century Fox studio and current chairman of the Caravan Pictures division of Disney , as chairman of Walt Disney Motion Pictures , a new entity .
He will be responsible for all live-action motion picture production and distribution .
The two top executives of Disney 's feature animation division , Peter Schneider and Tom Schumacher , will report to Roy Disney , company vice chairman .
Rich Frank , president of the Walt Disney Studios since 1985 , was named chairman of a new Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications unit , including Disney 's growing interactive software unit , which recently had been given to Mr. Katzenberg .
Hollywood Records now will report to the consumer products unit , while the theater division 's place in the new hierarchy has n't been determined .
Mr. Katzenberg says he has n't made any specific decisions about his future .
`` I have no rules about being No. 1 somewhere , '' he said .
But four major entertainment companies , each nearing a transitional phase , have been mentioned by industry observers as possible roosting places .
Peter Guber , chairman of Sony Corp. 's Sony Pictures unit , reportedly has indicated he may leave the company .
But Sony 's U.S. unit issued a statement denying any reports of a change at the top or that Mr. Katzenberg might join the company .
At Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. 's MCA Inc. , the top two executives , Chairman Lew Wasserman and President Sidney Sheinberg , are working under contracts that expire at the end of next year .
Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. .
Chairman Thomas Murphy is expected to step down soon , and although there 's a frontrunner to succeed him , Robert Iger , no one has been named .
And if CBS Inc. was prepared to have Barry Diller run the network , some argue , why not Mr. Katzenberg ?
None of the other companies had any immediate comment , and Mr. Katzenberg said he had no conversations about job opportunities .
Mr. Katzenberg had laid the groundwork for leaving the company a year ago , when he exercised an option in his six-year contract to have the right to terminate the contract this year , two years early .
`` By doing that , he walked away from $ 100 million in stock options and grants , '' said music mogul David Geffen , a close friend of Mr. Katzenberg .
What Mr. Katzenberg wanted was a larger , more strategic role in the company .
He had wanted to help Messrs. Eisner and Wells implement a corporate transformation they were planning , and advocated such measures as buying a TV network to do it .
Mr. Eisner , always reluctant to spend money on acqusitions , was more reluctant .
Mr. Katzenberg also wanted some authority over Disney 's theme parks .
Mr. Wells 's unexpected death created an empty chair , but one Mr. Eisner did n't wish to fill , at least with Mr. Katzenberg , with whom he has had a complex relationship .
They worked closely together at Disney for 10 years , and for years at Paramount before that .
But they were never close .
Several company executives also say there was tension between Mr. Katzenberg and Roy Disney , Walt 's nephew and one of the main forces responsible for bringing Mr. Eisner to the company .
Mr. Katzenberg would n't comment .
Mr. Disney reportedly was in Ireland and could n't be reached .
The directors and some company investors were deeply loyal to Mr. Wells and never trusted Mr. Katzenberg .
To some , he was a `` movie-picker '' rather than a hard-nosed businessman .
Mr. Katzenberg 's division , however , is known as the most hard-nosed , cost-conscious , tough-negotiating film arm in Hollywood .
Sanford M. Litvack , executive vice president for law and human resources who has been mentioned as a possible successor to Mr. Wells , will assume the new role of chief of corporate operations , an assignment that gives him many of the late president 's duties .
But Disney said its chief financial officer and divisional heads will continue to report to Mr. Eisner .
Mr. Eisner and Mr. Watson also said the company is n't ruling out eventually naming a successor to Mr. Wells as president and chief operating officer .
Mr. Katzenberg , for his part , said he was going on vacation as planned next week -- to Walt Disney World .

'' This giant twitchy rube was to become the most famous critic in the history of English literature , the embodiment of the age of reason , the author of the first English dictionary and first proper edition of Shakespeare , of classic essays , poems , fiction and biographies .
And , of course , the hero of the most famous biography in English history , Boswell 's `` Life of Samuel Johnson , LL .
D. '' But in his remarkable new `` Dr. Johnson & Mr. Savage '' -LRB- Pantheon , 260 pages , $ 23 -RRB- , Richard Holmes argues that the image of Boswell 's Johnson -- the living classic , the indomitable wit and infallible cultural authority -- has obscured the figure of that crude young man from the provinces .
Young Johnson , writes Mr. Holmes , was often less classic than early romantic .
In fact , in one of Johnson 's earliest works of genius , his impassioned `` Life of Mr. Richard Savage '' of 1744 , he invented a most romantic literary form -- the modern biography .
For Mr. Holmes , that breakthrough book and Johnson 's mysterious Grub Street friendship with Savage during his first two years in London suggest that young Johnson himself was in a state of profound romantic self-conflict .
Mr. Holmes describes him as a volatile and emotionally naive country Faust who fell in with a notoriously tricky , urbane Mephistopheles .
A distinguished biographer of Shelley and Coleridge , and a masterful literary detective , Mr. Holmes wants to get to the psychological center of Johnson and Savage 's friendship , the dynamic that led Johnson to his memorial work of genius .
Mr. Holmes wants to write `` the biography of a biography '' -- to get to the heart of the matter .
So he starts to dig and unearths Savage 's life in all its seedy , pathological , phosphorescent splendor .
Born in 1697 or 1698 , Savage was a poet , playwright , satirist , celebrity and sleaze , who killed a man in a drunken brawl in a whorehouse , pulled literary and social strings to receive a royal pardon and proclaimed himself -LRB- in his most famous poetical works -RRB- `` The Bastard '' and `` The Wanderer .
'' Savage claimed he was the abandoned bastard son of licentious aristocrats , whom he hounded and blackmailed for years on end .
He cadged a pension of # 200 a year from a putative noble cousin -LRB- who was enthralled by his self-dramatizing literary and social skills -RRB- and , having failed to be named poet laureate , simply called himself the volunteer laureate and churned out a poem a year in praise of Queen Caroline -LRB- who contributed another # 50 -RRB- .
Savage knew and put the touch on everybody in literary and aristocratic London , but he squandered every penny as soon as he got it on drunken sprees and bit every hand that tried to feed him .
For years , he was a virtuoso con man , the original victim .
When Johnson met him in 1737 , the 40-year-old Savage was often living in the streets , and he soon initiated Johnson into the mysteries of London 's literary\/criminal\/bohemian night-town .
Over the next two years Johnson slowly got his bearings , but Savage fell to pieces , finally leaving London in 1739 and dying in debtors ' prison in Bristol in 1743 .
The news of his death inflamed Johnson 's genius .
Within three months he wrote an account of his friend 's sorry life and thereby invented modern biography .
As Mr. Holmes describes it , the form was a hybrid designed to rival the newly invented novel by combining elements from Latin models and popular English forms -- `` the scandal romance , the sensational Newgate confession , the sentimental ballad ... '' Johnson also , for the first time in literary history , incorporated direct quotations from Savage 's works to provide a kind of true-life hero 's monologue and a way of proving Savage 's literary importance .
Johnson portrayed Savage as a now-familiar romantic type , the misunderstood , tormented poet , a victim of a cruel mother .
Johnson 's sympathies even led him willfully or unconsciously to distort or ignore factual truth at times , but he also presented Savage as a totally self-destructive , untrustworthy wretch .
So , Mr. Holmes argues , modern biography was born from a struggle between attraction and repulsion , between identification and unblinking moral and psychological realism .
For Mr. Holmes , Johnson and Savage are like Jekyll and Hyde , and biography is often a covert autobiography -- indeed a kind of exorcism .
Unstable , theatrical , a Protean self , Savage is startlingly similar to another great paradigm of irrational deviancy -- Rameau 's nephew , the titular hero of Denis Diderot 's equivalent masterpiece -LRB- 1761-1774 -RRB- .
It happily enlarges our sense of tradition to consider that two totems of the European Enlightenment -- the author of the English dictionary , the creator of the French encyclopedia -- both wrote books that suggest that inside every really great man of reason is a romantic screaming to get out .

On a sultry August evening in this city built on meatpacking , milling , timber and railroads , some 50-odd choristers straggle into the nave at Grace and Holy Trinity Cathedral .
They form two rows before the choir screen .
Dressed in cutoffs , T-shirts , sandals and sundresses , they settle down to the arduous work that has brought them here for three hours every Tuesday evening since early June : the fiendishly difficult and very obscure choral work `` Figure Humaine '' -LRB- `` Human Face '' -RRB- , written in 1943 as a horrified lamentation over the vileness of war by the French composer Francis Poulenc -LRB- 1899-1963 -RRB- .
Chorale director Arnold Epley rehearses the basses on the chantlike motive that opens the piece : `` De tous les printemps du monde Celui-ci est le plus laid '' -LRB- `` Of all the springtimes of the world This one is the ugliest '' -RRB- .
This ugly springtime is France under German occupation .
Poulenc took a series of poems by Paul Eluard and set them for two a capella choirs in six parts .
The score was published clandestinely .
Phrase by phrase , the singers slog through the piece .
`` We 've got diction problems and pitch problems , '' Mr. Epley tells them a few pages later .
`` Fight it as much as you can .
Do n't be surprised when things that are n't the hard part spring a leak .
'' As if the French vowels were n't slippery enough for the singers to get their lips around , Poulenc 's music is giving them fits .
It piles dense , unlovely harmonies on a complex vocal line .
Poulenc 's voice-leading is hopeless ; he expects the singers to pull notes out of thin air .
The chorale 's performance will cap a four-day festival entirely devoted to Poulenc .
This week there have been two lectures , a master class , a roundtable discussion about the occupation , and a `` soiree de melodies '' on Wednesday night .
An open rehearsal for `` Figure Humaine '' will be held tonight , and the big blowout Poulenc Soiree , for solo , chamber music and `` Figure , '' is tomorrow .
This is the fifth annual Kansas City Poulenc Festival , and the grandest .
It is timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Paris .
Tomorrow night the audience will fill the Episcopal cathedral .
Attendance last summer reached 400 .
`` It astonished me , '' said Scott Cantrell , classical-music critic for the Kansas City Star .
`` I think there are probably few cities in the world where that would happen .
I 'm not even sure it would happen in Paris .
'' The little festival is put on without box-office stars flying in ; nor does it conform to the Mostly Mozart model , in which other composers ' pieces leaven the mix .
No , this is purely Poulenc , an homage to a relatively obscure member of the Parisian midcentury avant-garde , who , despite his mix of charm and religious seriousness , does n't make anybody 's list of immortal 20th-century composers -- except perhaps Catharine Strom 's .
Ms. Strom is the founder , president and guiding light of the Friends of Francis Poulenc USA , which has its headquarters in her dining room .
`` It 's not as if when we had our first Poulenc Soiree , that I saw down the road that we 'd have a corporation .
It grew kind of by accident , '' she explained late one night by telephone from classical radio station KXTR , where she is the graveyard-shift announcer .
`` Francis , '' as Ms. Strom refers to him , `` is just a composer that I started out by liking a little bit , then liked more and eventually became my favorite composer and turned into a passion .
'' Like most music lovers , Ms. Strom started out knowing little about Poulenc , except that he was the most immediately appealing member of the cabal of composers known as Les Six .
Among the six were Honneger and Milhaud .
Poulenc 's other obvious distinction was being the son of the founder of Rhone-Poulenc S.A. , the French pharmaceuticals giant .
During her first trip to France , Ms. Strom attended a concert of Poulenc 's music in Paris .
She saw a reference in the program to `` Les Amis de Francis Poulenc .
'' When she asked about these friends of the composer , people pointed her toward a woman walking out the door .
Rosine Seringe invited the American stranger to visit Poulenc 's country home in the Loire Valley , a grand villa that she had inherited .
`` She picked me up at the railroad station at Amboise and took me out to the house .
I got to see his piano and all the pictures -- of Debussy , and the postcard from Stravinsky -- his music and his records and all that .
It was wonderful .
It was July 21 , 1983 .
I went out of my mind .
'' But why Poulenc , finally ?
`` Because it 's neat music , '' Ms. Strom answers .
And because Poulenc needs friends : `` I 'm firm in my belief that you do n't have to turn around to hear Mozart and Beethoven , but Poulenc is n't heard often enough and I think it should be heard .
People like it once they hear it .
They just need to have their elbows rubbed in it .
'' And why Kansas City ?
According to Mr. Cantrell it 's because people here `` do n't know that they ` re not supposed to like Poulenc .
'' Also , he thinks `` it proves radio 's power to create audiences for things .
Catharine Strom has been such a pusher for Poulenc over the years .
I ca n't imagine that this would have happened any other way .
'' But even Ms. Strom could n't have brought off the festival without Kansas City 's unsung singing community .
The members of the Chorale Francis Poulenc are foot soldiers in the city 's musical life : soloists in the church choirs , music teachers , bit players in the Kansas City opera company .
They can sight-read most things , but not `` Figure Humaine .
'' The music is so hard , and the text so emotionally wrenching , that the work is almost never performed .
Eluard 's poems employ harrowing surrealist images to conjure up the degradation of the human spirit in war : little girls killed in the town square , poison spitting darkness on humanity , appetites of blood , death as the god of love .
The music , Mr. Epley believes , must be as bleak as the text .
`` What would you write for Auschwitz ?
What would you write for living in Rwanda this week ?
It 's the worst of ourselves .
It should be absolutely awful to listen to .
It 's about looking in the face of hell .
'' Rehearsing the penultimate section with the chorale , he says : `` We are not trained to sing like that .
We are not trained to go beyond good sense , to go beyond beautiful sound .
Right here we want the C sharps to be damn near unbearable : ` A des hommes indestructibles .
' Just in our face !
'' The chorale responds with a nerve-shattering forte .
The effect is awe-inspiring ; one 's knees incline to the floor to pray .
At 10 p.m. , the rehearsal over , Mr. Epley addresses the tired choristers : `` Go after the text , the meaning .
No matter how mythic these events , we are only one person removed from the skin and bone .
I 'm asking you to spend some time thinking about it .
We 've got to finish fixing this on our own .

`` It 's a pretty healthy move , no question about it , '' he said .
`` I think this is the beginning of a rally , and smaller stocks should outperform larger issues significantly for the year .

`` But it was a positive day , and the market 's tone is very encouraging .

Gruner & Jahr USA Publishing said it will stop publishing Real Beauty magazine , the company 's first significant move since acquiring the women 's magazines of the New York Times Co. .
The mass-market beauty and lifestyle magazine will close after completing its September\/October issue due on newsstands Sept. 13 , said Gruner & Jahr , New York , the U.S. publishing arm of Germany 's Bertelsmann AG .
Real Beauty was started as a special-interest publication in 1993 .
Gruner & Jahr said Real Beauty was in the `` test phase '' and had published four issues .
John Heins , chief executive officer of Gruner & Jahr , said the decision to close Real Beauty was based on `` the need to concentrate investment on the more-established magazines we have acquired .
'' Last month , Gruner & Jahr , publishers of Parents and YM magazines , acquired the Women 's Magazine division of the Times Co. , which includes Family Circle , McCall 's and Child .
Sandoz AG closed its $ 53-a-share tender offer for Gerber Products Co. , after the Swiss concern 's planned $ 3.7 billion acquisition of the U.S. maker of baby food cleared a final regulatory hurdle .
Sandoz said it received approval yesterday from New York state insurance authorities to assume ownership of a Gerber life-insurance unit .
Accordingly , Sandoz said , the tender offer it launched in May closed at its scheduled 5 p.m. EDT expiration yesterday .
The offer had been extended July 1 , at which time Sandoz said stockholders of Gerber , of Fremont , Mich. , had tendered about 87 % of Gerber 's about 71 million common shares outstanding .
The transaction has already received clearance from U.S. antitrust authorities , and the format made stockholder approval unnecessary .
Assuming Sandoz has been tendered the 90 % minimum stake on which it predicated the offer , an official said , the deal could close within a `` matter of days .
'' Your Marketplace article of July 22 about the Sixth International Conference on Thinking at MIT July 17-22 warrants some elaboration .
The conference was organized for the world-wide community of educators , the business community , and the community of health care professionals .
It was designed to bring the best of research and practice on ways of improving the quality of thinking together so that members of these communities could learn from each other and expand their efforts .
Such world-renowned figures as Howard Gardner of Harvard University , developer of the theory of multiple intelligences ; Reuven Feuerstein of the International Center for the Enhancement of Learning Potential in Jerusalem , who has done path-breaking work on elevating the performance of functionally illiterate people ; Peter Senge of the Sloan School of Management at MIT , whose work on systems thinking has been invaluable in problem-solving efforts in the corporate world , and Edward de Bono of the Cognitive Research Trust in England , whose work on creative thinking has transformed the way many businesses operate , exchanged ideas with an audience of close to 2,000 from over 50 countries .
The efforts to understand human cognition , to develop ways of helping ourselves and others make more careful decisions , engage in more informed problem-solving , exercise more critical judgment and display more creativity on the job and in our lives , have been lauded by educational organizations , government agencies and business organizations as providing an approach that can transform performances and productivity in school , the workplace and the home .
Conference participants will continue the dialogues started at the conference through a newly established world-wide electronic network called Interthink .
W.H. Smith Group PLC , a London book and music retailer , said pretax profit for the fiscal year ended May 28 fell 27 % to # 83.4 million -LRB- $ 129.7 million -RRB- from # 113.8 million a year earlier , after an exceptional charge of # 41.4 million .

On behalf of the American Bar Association , I write to respond to the Aug. 10 article entitled , `` The ABA Has Fallen Down on the Job , '' by retired Chief Justice Warren E. Burger .
There is no lawyer in America who loves the law and the legal profession more than Chief Justice Burger and , thus , I know that he understands perfectly that while reasonable persons will agree with much of what he says , reasonable persons also will differ on certain points he makes .
Lawyers and judges have argued for years about which issues the organized bar should become involved in .
These arguments have intensified as society has become increasingly complex .
Specifically , I speak to the destructive myth put forward by the Federalist Society and others that our annual meeting focuses solely on so-called social issues rather than legal issues .
Because of a changed society there is now almost nothing that is not part of the legal system .
This is why our House of Delegates -- our policy-making body -- must deal with a broad range of issues , which affect the law , the legal profession and the justice system .
The ABA has debated , for example , antitrust law and AIDS ; secured transactions and sexual orientation ; champerty and maintenance , and the myriad and complex issues involving children in America .
In short , the ABA facilitates debate among professionals about tough issues .
What results is a collective judgment affecting the profession , the justice system and our communities .
Contrast this professional debate , if you will , with the viciousness , partisanship , name-calling and mischaracterization which these days marks so much of our `` public debate .
'' The ABA remains committed to our fundamental mission ; to serve and improve the legal profession , to serve and improve the justice system and to serve and improve the communities in which we live .
In doing so , we know we will face criticism .
But in pursuing our mission , we fulfill the role for which we were called to the bar .
Comstock Resources Inc. agreed to acquire certain interests in the oil and gas properties of its Stanford Offshore Energy Inc. unit .
Comstock , a Dallas oil and gas company , said it reached the agreement with MG Trade Finance Corp. , a unit of Metallgesellschaft AG , which owns a 5 % overriding royalty interest on all of Stanford Offshore 's oil and gas properties .
The royalty interest converts to a 25 % net-profit interest on Jan. 1 , 1997 .
In a news release , Comstock said MG acquired its interests in Stanford Offshore as part of an agreement to provide Stanford with a $ 22.1 million credit facility .
Under the agreement between Comstock and MG , Comstock will repay outstanding principal on the credit facility , totaling $ 13.9 million , and accrued interest .
In addition , it will pay MG $ 800,000 in cash for its Stanford Offshore interests .

First National has more than 2.4 million shares of common stock outstanding .
However , Old Kent valued the transaction at $ 92.9 million by including unexercised stock options .
The move would give Grand Rapids , Mich.-based Old Kent a foothold in Macomb County , one of the three counties of metropolitan Detroit .
First National Bank operates 16 branches in Macomb ; Old Kent operates none .
Your Aug. 18 Politics and Policy report on the Federal Election Commission -LRB- FEC -RRB- misrepresented my reasons for offering an amendment to cut the FEC 's budget request for 1995 by $ 3.5 million .
Judging from your account , one would think my motive was to punish the FEC for getting tougher in cracking down on campaign violations .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
As I have said repeatedly , I would support the extra $ 3.5 million -LRB- every penny of which is an increase over this year 's budget -RRB- if it were used for a computer upgrade that would allow candidates to file their finance reports electronically .
The original budget request from the Clinton administration specifically `` fenced off '' $ 4 million for just that purpose .
Electronic filing would improve the FEC 's efficiency substantially , thus freeing up its employees to do a more thorough job of pursuing egregious violators .
When the bill reached the House floor , however , the `` fence '' had been taken off the additional money , meaning the funds could disappear in the FEC 's bureaucratic black hole instead of going for the computer upgrade .
Examples of FEC inefficiency are numerous and legendary .
-LRB- It even took six years to assess penalties for the 1988 presidential campaign !
-RRB- I do n't think the taxpayers are well-served by such an inefficient , overexpensive , unreformed bureaucratic morass .
The vote to hold FEC funds at last year 's level was thus an effort not to punish the agency , but to force accountability -- and lead directly to less foul play in elections .
BOCA RATON , Fla. -- Sky Scientific Inc. said it has acquired , through a subsidiary , about 200,000 tons of extracted ore containing gold , silver and other precious metals .
The mining-related company valued the transaction at $ 120 million in Sky Scientific preferred stock .
The company , citing security concerns , declined to identify the California-based seller .
French government officials hinted that the state would likely sell only a minority stake in Renault SA if the auto maker is chosen as the next company to be floated as part of France 's privatization program .
While saying that no decision on which company would be floated next will be reached until mid-September , Nicolas Sarkozy , French budget minister , said yesterday that Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has `` always wished that Renault remain French and that the state will continue to play an important role '' in the company .
Analysts interpreted the statement as a signal to the market -- and , perhaps more significantly , to trade unions -- that the government would likely retain a 51 % stake in Renault if it decided to put the auto maker next on the selling block .
The opposition Socialist and Communist parties and left-wing trade unions have indicated they planned to oppose Renault 's privatization , and Mr. Balladur is eager to avoid a damaging labor conflict 10 months before presidential elections .
Please discontinue my membership in the American Association of Retired Persons and return my dues .
AARP has acted politically and without any attempt to determine the wishes of its members in publicly supporting the partisan Mitchell health care bill .
I am one of the large majority of citizens who have a very satisfactory , 80 % company-paid health plan .
I do not want this disturbed and remade in some government image with government controls and regulation that determines who my doctor is , what I can buy and what it costs .
We do not have a major health problem in the U.S. .
We may need to add or extend coverage for some , assure transportability for all and restrict the lawyers who milk the system , but this does not justify the programs proposed by the Clintons and Senator Mitchell .
I , as a member of AARP , am opposed to them .
AARP has no business taking any position on any legislation unless the organization has first obtained the members ' views ; that is the American democratic way .
In all the years I have been a member , I have yet to receive anything from the national office that asks for my opinion ; nor has there been any local effort to secure such ; nor has there been any reporting of what actions AARP is considering on my behalf .
Local groups are purely social .
AARP should not use the national office for political ends .
I am very distressed that AARP is advocating a political agenda which is represented as being the opinion of most AARP members .
AARP does not speak for me and my friends who are also senior citizens and members of AARP .
I did not see anything in my membership application that authorized AARP to speak politically for me or other members .
My purpose in joining AARP was to enjoy the benefits of large group purchases of travel , medical insurance , prescription drugs and other similar programs .
I am asking my senators and congressmen to propose legislation that forces organizations such as AARP , labor unions , etc. , to state what percentage of their members have given the organization permission to speak politically for its members .
If AARP does not cease this unauthorized course of action , I will cancel my membership even if it results in additional costs .
The endorsement by AARP officers of the Clinton health plan is an outrage .
What in the world possessed AARP representatives to even mildly favor , let alone endorse -LRB- with the implication that AARP members endorse -RRB- , this bureaucratic boondoggle ?
If you as individuals want to support the Clinton monstrosity , that 's your privilege -- but do n't presume to speak for me .
DARIEN , Conn. -- London Fog Corp. divided its chairman 's and chief executive officer 's duties after the recent departure of Arnold Cohen , who held those posts for about a year .
John Varvatos , 40 years old , a former corporate president of menswear for Calvin Klein before joining London Fog in November 1993 , was named chairman .
This is an additional responsibility for Mr. Varvatos , who continues as executive vice president of product design and merchandising .
James Milligan , 55 years old , was named to the additional position of chief executive officer at the manufacturer of raincoats and outerwear .
Mr. Milligan , a former president of Sunbeam Corp. , continues as chairman of the board 's executive committee .
In addition , the company announced the formation of a new operating committee , organized by Mr. Cohen `` to reinvigorate and build upon '' the company 's existing brands , `` while aggressively expanding the scope of the company 's activities '' in areas other than rainwear and outerwear , the company said .
London Fog is majority-owned by First Capital Partners of New York .
GKH Investments L.P. in Chicago holds a 36 % stake .
NEW YORK -- A little-discussed Securities and Exchange Commission proposal would , for the first time , require mutual funds to report the average commission they pay for every share they trade .
Briefly outlined deep in the SEC 's Aug. 10 proposal on broadening disclosure of directed-brokerage arrangements , the requirement would likely place new pressure on fund managers to search Wall Street for the lowest commission rates .
This , naturally , is a prospect the brokerage industry fears .
Under current rules , mutual funds need only report aggregate commission expenses for the most recent three fiscal years in an informational supplement to their prospectuses .
This Statement of Additional Information is n't included in the prospectus , so many investors never see the information .
The proposal for more detailed disclosure of commission expenses is part of a broader effort by the SEC to give mutual-fund investors information that accurately reflects funds ' expenses , and thus performance .
A spokesman for the Investment Company Institute said that while a formal review of the proposal has n't been completed , the mutual-fund trade group `` supports the notion of more specific disclosure '' of funds ' expenses .
Commission costs are n't disclosed separately in funds ' reporting of expenses , but are incorporated in the cost of buying -- or the return on selling -- securities .
In directed-brokerage agreements , brokerage firms agree to cover certain expenses of mutual funds in exchange for the funds ' trading business .
Walt Disney Co. is a family treasure .
The thrill that young children experience at California 's Disneyland or Florida 's Disney World is unforgettable ; they absorb most everything .
Disney primarily is entertainment , but the Epcot Center in Orlando shows that it can educate well too .
Thus , it 's hard to imagine a better company than Disney to create a theme park on American history -- a subject about which many kids are shamefully ignorant .
This is exactly what it proposes to do in Haymarket , Va. , about 35 miles from Washington .
This is the right company with the right idea -- in the wrong place .
The 3,000 acres on which Disney has proposed to build its theme park , 1,300 hotel rooms , 2,300 homes , a golf course , a campsite and a waterpark are in Virginia 's Northern Piedmont , an area unsurpassed in the richness of its history .
From Charlottesville in the south to Harper 's Ferry in the north there are 22 Civil War battlefields , including the 1st and 2nd Manassas , Chancellorsville and Brandy Station .
The homes of Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , James Monroe and John Marshall are here .
`` If you go to Brandy Station and draw a 100-mile circle you will cover every battle fought by General Lee and the army of northern Virginia , '' says Civil War historian Shelby Foote .
`` It 's not the Disney area itself ; it 's the hucksters who will be attracted to it .
To disturb this area is sacrilege .
'' Mr. Foote is one of close to 200 prominent historians who are fiercely opposing the Disney project .
As Richard Moe , president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation , notes , `` We do n't know of any area that has a greater concentration of historical resources .
'' Although some historians argue that Disney will distort history wherever a park is built , that 's not Mr. Moe 's point : `` The only real issue here is this precise location .
'' Disney counters that it 's well aware of the historical import of the area , but it charges the critics exaggerate ; the proposed theme park is four miles from the Manassas battlefield .
`` If historic preservation means that you ca n't build anything of significance near anything that is historic , then the cause of preservation is going down the tubes , '' argues Jody Powell , a civil war buff and top Washington public relations official who has been hired by Disney .
Other officials note that Prince William County , the location of the proposed Disney 's America , is going to be developed anyway in the next few decades and Disney will do it more tastefully and with more control than more ad hoc development .
Moreover , they argue that the project will attract millions -- an estimated 6.3 million visitors annually -- who then , in turn , will take in other historical attractions , including the Civil War battlefields and all the history of Washington .
Disney has promised the theme park will tout these monuments .
Company chairman Michael Eisner contends the theme park will get people more interested in this history , remembering that `` I was dragged to Washington as a kid and it was the worst weekend of my life .
'' More privately , proponents charge the opposition is being led by the fox-hunting crowd that does n't want its upper-crust environment threatened , and that history is too important to be left to historians .
There are some fox-hunting elitists opposed to Disney and the final word should n't rest solely with historians .
But the diversity and depth of the opposition from academics and writers seriously interested in American history is impressive .
If all the major experts on baseball had opposed Cooperstown in 1939 , the Baseball Hall of Fame probably would n't exist or would be someplace else .
And no one denies there will be development in Prince William County .
-LRB- Both the state and county governments are fully behind this project and have doled out lots of taxpayer-financed largesse .
-RRB- But the huge theme park not only dwarfs anything else envisioned -- it also seems certain to produce countless other fast-food restaurants , housing projects , motels and other support services .
A study conducted for Mr. Moe 's historic preservation organization by Synergy Resources of Fairfax , Va. , predicts sizable sprawl in the wake of Disney .
Within two decades it envisions this largely rural area turning into the 141st-largest urban area in the country , about the size of Tallahassee , Fla. , today .
It 's not necessary for Disney to dig in its heels .
The company listed four criteria in selecting a site : a location near the nation 's capital ; one with immediate access to an interstate highway ; a place already zoned for development ; and a site sufficiently large .
There are a couple of possibilities that meet most all these criteria : the still developing area around Washington 's Dulles Airport , 28 miles from the city , or somewhere along route 95 between the capital and Fredericksburg , Va. , 52 miles to the south .
The land may be a little more expensive , but that should be a small price for Disney to pay ; the cost of a protracted and bitter battle over the current location may be more costly .
WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission has sent out a series of letters to exchanges instructing them to toughen their scrutiny and punishment of so-called rogue brokers .
The letters from William McLucas , director of the SEC 's enforcement division , and Brandon Becker , director of market regulation , are a follow-up to the agency 's Large Firm Project Report .
That report was a study of the hiring and supervisory practices of stockbrokers at nine of the country 's biggest securities firms .
Among other things , the letters instruct exchanges to spend more time reviewing allegations made by disgruntled investors in arbitration claims against stockbrokers .
They also ask the exchanges to toughen sanctions when brokers break rules and question the hiring practices of securities firms that hire brokers with histories of disciplinary problems .
`` We ask that you inform us about what steps you have taken or intend to take to devote additional resources to prosecuting sales-practice cases against problem brokers who have violated your rules , '' the letters say .
An SEC spokesman said the agency has n't yet received responses from the exchanges .
The SEC 's action was first reported yesterday in the Los Angeles Times .
WILMINGTON , Del. -- Unitrin Inc. agreed to suspend its stock repurchase until Monday morning while a judge considers a request by hostile suitor American General Corp. for an order to block the buyback .
Unitrin agreed to the suspension at the request of the judge , Vice Chancellor William B. Chandler III , who is hearing the case in Delaware Chancery Court .
American General , a Houston-based insurance company , wants to stop the buyback of 10 million shares , or about 19 % of the total outstanding , because it would increase the combined Unitrin stake held by the Chicago insurer 's directors to 28 % from 23 % .
That would give them the power to block any acquisition of the company , because Unitrin 's bylaws call for 75 % shareholder approval of a sale .
American General has offered to buy Unitrin for $ 50.375 a share , or $ 2.6 billion .
Unitrin 's board has rejected the bid .
American General is also asking the court for an injunction ordering Unitrin to negotiate a merger with American General .
Heavy trading in Unitrin 's stock continued yesterday for a second day , apparently reflecting purchases by Unitrin .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading , Unitrin shares fell $ 1.063 to $ 50 .
The stock was trading at $ 39.75 just before American General disclosed its bid on Aug. 2 .
WASHINGTON -- Tax increases , spending cuts and a robust economy led the Congressional Budget Office to slash its forecast of this year 's federal budget deficit to $ 202 billion , but it expects the red ink to rise again by the end of the decade .
Under its new forecast , the nonpartisan budget office also said that the 1995 deficit would fall to $ 162 billion , or 2.3 % of gross domestic product , in 1995 .
That would mark the smallest deficit as a percentage of the country 's total output of goods and services since 1979 .
The estimate for the fiscal 1994 budget deficit represents 3 % of GDP .
In January , the office was forecasting a $ 228 billion deficit for the current year .
The CBO estimate is slightly more optimistic than the Clinton administration 's forecast .
The White House projects a $ 220.1 billion deficit , or 3.3 % of GDP , for fiscal 1994 .
For 1995 , it forecasts a $ 167.1 billion deficit , or 2.4 % of GDP .
The shrinking deficit , the CBO report said , results primarily from last year 's budget law , which cut spending and raised taxes in equal measure , and from a burst of economic growth .
Some technical re-estimates had a small effect .
The good deficit news will end , the CBO says , in 1996 , when the budget gap slowly begins to grow again , primarily because of expected increases in Medicare and Medicaid costs as the population ages .
The two programs together will grow at an average annual rate of about 11 % from 1995 to 1999 , while other outlays are expected to grow by an annual rate below 4 % .
By 1999 , the deficit would hit $ 231 billion , higher than the $ 213 billion that the CBO forecast last winter .
`` This report confirms that we have made major progress on reducing the deficit , '' said White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta , `` but that until we get health-care costs under control , our work is not done .
'' The report warned , however , that none of the health-care proposals that the CBO has analyzed so far is likely to significantly reduce the deficit for the next decade .
The budget office forecasts 3.6 % growth for the year , almost one percentage point higher than its previous forecast , but only slightly higher than the 3.4 % forecast by the Clinton administration .
WASHINGTON -- Orders for big-ticket factory items tumbled in July , pointing to an economy downshifting in the third quarter .
The 4.2 % decline , to $ 144.87 billion , was the largest in 2 1\/2 years , the Commerce Department said .
`` It does n't tell you the economy is falling out of bed , but it 's going through some serious negative momentum in the current quarter , '' said Paul McCulley of UBS Securities .
He predicts a rebound in the fourth quarter , after U.S. businesses work off unusually high inventories in the July-September quarter .
Most of the decline in orders for durable goods , those meant to last three years or more , was due to a 15.8 % drop-off in transportation equipment .
Much of the transportation decline , to $ 31.91 billion , was a result of a two-week shutdown at auto factories as manufacturers switched lines to the new year 's models .
But orders for new capital goods , a barometer of business-investment plans , also dropped , falling 7 % to $ 41.98 billion .
And an important subcategory -- orders for nondefense capital goods other than aircraft , which vary widely from month to month -- fell 3.8 % to $ 33.24 billion .
Robert Barr , deputy chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , said the report `` is another indication that the economic growth suspected by the financial markets and the Federal Reserve to be both too strong and inflationary is neither .
'' One spot of modest strength is unfilled orders for nondefense capital goods , excluding aircraft , which rose 1.7 % to $ 85.05 billion .
That should keep factories busy into the fourth quarter , analysts said .
Financial markets yawned at the report , which showed no sign of inflation .
Following the Federal Reserve 's half-point increase in interest rates last week , every lackluster report on the economy staves off the next interest-rate boost further .
`` The market is saying that the consensus opinion is that today the next Fed move is further away than it was yesterday , '' said Mr. McCulley .
All numbers are adjusted for normal seasonal variations .
By Wall Street Journal estimates , the world 's derivatives markets are far larger than most people realize and far exceed the latest assessment published by the General Accounting Office .
Total derivatives outstanding currently top $ 35 trillion , roughly twice the congressional agency 's estimate for year-end 1992 .
The numbers are based on the value of the stocks , bonds , currencies and money-market instruments that underlie these arrangements and determine their worth -- measures known as open interest or `` notional '' value .
Unlike the situation in securities transactions , little or no money changes hands when most derivatives trades are initiated .
One reason private derivatives outstanding exceed exchange-traded contracts : When participants in private trades unwind their derivatives before maturity , they do so by executing new , offsetting derivatives rather than by erasing the initial transactions .
Thus , the original contract remains in place , and the new contract increases the total size of the market .
Although the current totals may reflect some discrepancies in how private derivatives are calculated , they primarily indicate the huge growth in these markets .
The pace of that expansion is obvious in exchange-listed totals , where data are easiest to pin down .
At the time of the GAO study , for instance , the notional value of Eurodollar futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amounted to about $ 1.3 trillion .
By this June 30 , the notional value had about doubled to more than $ 2.5 trillion .
Eurodollar options , with notional values now approaching $ 4 trillion world-wide , have likewise mushroomed .
In a case of the tail wagging the dog , the value of exchange-traded Eurodollar derivatives is now roughly 13 times the underlying market .
Actual Eurodollars -- dollar deposits held outside the U.S. -- total a modest $ 500 billion , according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
What makes these derivatives so attractive is that they are very liquid , much easier to trade than Treasury bills , money-market funds or actual deposits .
The boom in Eurodollar futures and options also underscores the growth of less-public derivatives markets .
That 's because listed Eurodollar derivatives not only are the most efficient way to trade short-term U.S. interest rates , says Todd Petzel , an executive vice president at the Merc .
They also are the `` basic building block '' for many other interest-rate derivatives .
Starting last year , for example , rising interest rates touched off a scramble by floating-rate borrowers to lock in fixed rates .
`` The vehicle of choice for that sort of thing is the interest-rate swap , '' Mr. Petzel says .
But dealers who create those swaps need somewhere to lay off their own exposure to rising rates -- and one of their vehicles of choice is Eurodollar futures .
ROCHESTER , N.Y. -- Gleason Corp. said its board unanimously rejected an offer from Field Point Capital Management Co. to acquire the Gleason shares it does n't already own for $ 18 each .
Gleason , a maker of gear-production machines for the auto industry , said directors determined it was `` not an appropriate time '' to sell the company because of its current restructuring .
It also called the Field Point proposal `` inadequate .
'' James S. Gleason , chairman , said , `` the board believes that our strategic plan should not be interrupted or thwarted by an opportunistic attempt to acquire the company at less than its true value .
'' Field G.S. Beckwith Gilbert , Field Point 's president , said , `` We are not surprised by the continued reluctance of Mr. Gleason and his board to take steps to achieve any value for their shareholders .
'' Field Point , which currently owns about 12 % of the 5.2 million Gleason shares outstanding , made its offer last week .
Asked whether Gleason expected a counteroffer from Field Point or other bids , John J. Perrotti , Gleason 's vice president and controller , said , `` We really are n't speculating at this point .
'' Separately , a Gleason shareholder filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court alleging shareholder interests had been damaged by the company 's refusal to consider a takeover or other overtures from major shareholder groups .
Gleason said it could n't respond to the suit without further studying it .
Gleason also said it expects 1994 earnings from continuing operations to exceed 70 cents a share because of the restructuring and a recovery in its overseas markets .
In 1993 , Gleason reported a loss of $ 2.9 million , or 56 cents a share .
WESTLAKE VILLAGE , Calif. -- Dole Food Co. offered to pay $ 72 million , or $ 14 a share , for the 17 % of Castle & Cooke Homes Inc. it does n't already own .
The offer to reabsorb Castle & Cooke Homes into Dole was made in the form of a request that the Castle & Cooke board recommend a merger with Dole , a Dole spokesman said .
Castle & Cooke was spun off from Dole in March 1993 .
The spokesman said a committee of outside Castle & Cooke directors will study Dole 's proposal , and an independent investment-banking firm will issue a fairness opinion .
A spokesman for David H. Murdock , chairman and controlling holder of both Dole and Castle & Cooke Homes , declined to say why Mr. Murdock decided to make the offer at this time .
Mr. Murdock has said that he is unhappy with Castle & Cooke 's stock price .
Its 5.4 million shares were sold to the public at $ 15 each .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Castle & Cooke Homes shares jumped $ 2.50 , or 21 % , to $ 14.125 .
Dole shares closed at $ 29.25 , up 50 cents .
Castle & Cooke builds single-family homes in Hawaii , Bakersfield , Calif. , and Sierra Vista , Ariz. .
Dole , a large fresh-produce and packaged-food concern , also operates several resorts .
WASHINGTON -LRB- AP -RRB- -- An effort by two regional Bell companies to block AT&T Corp. 's planned $ 12.6 billion buyout of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. has been transferred back to a New York district court .
U.S. District Judge Harold Greene , who oversees a consent decree that broke up the Bell System , yesterday ordered the lawsuit returned to Judge Edward Korman of the Eastern District of New York .
Judge Korman had transferred the case last week to Judge Greene in Washington .
Judge Greene said no judicial efficiency would result from his taking the case .
Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. want the court to block the transaction .
Both companies use AT&T equipment in their cellular networks and serve the lucrative New York metropolitan area .
If the McCaw merger is completed , AT&T will also serve that market .
The two Bell companies argue that AT&T will have a `` strong incentive '' to impede competition there .
CANTON , Mass. -- Hills Stores Co. said it filed a lawsuit against Dickstein Partners Inc. , seeking to block the New York investment firm from increasing its stake in the discount retailer .
Additionally , Hills said it filed preliminary consent revocation materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission opposing Dickstein 's earlier SEC consent solicitation to replace four of Hills 's eight directors with Dickstein nominees .
Hills added that it retained Smith Barney Inc. as its financial adviser and D.F. King & Co. as its soliciting agent in connection with Dickstein 's consent solicitation .
Dickstein , which reported holding a 12.6 % stake in Hills Aug. 12 , has sought regulatory approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to acquire more than 50 % of Hills .
Hills emerged last October from protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code .
In a statement yesterday , Hills said that Apollo Capital Management Inc. and Thomas H. Lee , Hills chairman , holders of an aggregate 10.3 % stake in Hills , `` strongly oppose '' Dickstein 's proposal .
The company asserted that its same-store sales , which were up 7.1 % for the first six months of 1994 , are `` among the best in its industry .
'' Same-store sales refer to sales at stores open for at least a year .
Dickstein Partners said : `` We are extremely disappointed with the Hills board 's entrenchment actions since the announcement of our intent to solicit consents .
'' In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , Hills shares closed at $ 22.375 , up 37.5 cents .
Digital Equipment , the world 's third-largest computer maker , awarded its world-wide account to Omnicom Group 's DDB Needham , giving the advertising agency 's New York office its single largest win ever with billings estimated at $ 90 million to $ 120 million .
The win represents more than just a major new account for DDB Needham .
In snaring Digital , Needham beat Interpublic Group 's Lowe & Partners\/SMS , which has a reputation for being a hot creative shop on Madison Avenue .
Lowe lost the review following a creative shootout between the two agencies Tuesday at the company 's headquarters in Maynard , Mass. .
The decision to award the business to Needham was unanimous among the Digital executives heading its five different business units .
A Digital executive says Robert B. Palmer , Digital 's president and chief executive officer , `` does n't need a lot of time once he makes up his mind .
'' However , a major portion of Digital 's business -- its personal-computer division -- will continue to be handled by Young & Rubicam .
The personal-computer business was never part of the account review , which began in February .
Digital executives were n't specific about why Needham won the business .
But they said the agency will be instrumental in positioning the brand on a world-wide basis .
Digital has been struggling to cut costs and boost product sales after four years of losses .
Mr. Palmer recently restated his goal of returning the company to profitability by the end of 1994 .
Digital reported a $ 1.76 billion loss for its fourth quarter , ended July 2 , partly due to restructuring .
Revenue , essentially flat at $ 3.92 billion , stabilized for the first time in a year as sales of some new products rose sharply .
The Digital win is the first since Ken Kaess was named president of the New York office of DDB Needham last month .
`` The win is the result of a team effort and an indication that the team is going to be successful , '' says Mr. Kaess , who adds that the agency will hire an undetermined number of employees to work on the account .
Winning the Digital business finally ends an eight-month drought at Needham , which is perceived on Madison Avenue -- whether accurately or not -- as a shop that produces serviceable , if not provoking and exciting , ads .
Needham executives can feel somewhat vindicated in their expertise in selling computers .
The agency was fired seven months ago by NEC from its $ 35 million account .
Lowe , after winning diet Coke in the fall of 1993 , has been on a losing streak of late .
Its most recent major loss was Burger King , which was awarded to Ammirati & Puris , which has since become Ammirati & Puris\/Lintas , an Interpublic unit .
Lowe 's new business has been restricted to additional work for existing clients .
The agency says it goes after new business `` selectively '' and it has been concentrating on Lowe 's acquisition of Scali McCabe Sloves about 10 months ago .
A Digital spokesman says it `` has yet to determine '' what role Digital 's five incumbent agencies will play , if any .
The agencies are Arnold Fortuna Lawner & Cabot in Boston , Ketchum Communications in Pittsburgh , Mullen Advertising in Wenham , Mass. , and Ciociola & Co. and Publicis , both in New York .
Digital 's announcement of the account change mentioned only DDB Needham and Young & Rubicam .
In a related announcement , Digital said Maritz in Fenton , Mo. , and Ryan Partnership in Westport , Conn. , have been retained as the lead agencies to `` implement non-advertising marketing communications services and to work collaboratively '' with Needham .
In a statement , Mr. Palmer said , `` A singular corporate voice reflected in a powerful world-wide brand reinforces the positive attributes associated with the company it represents .
'' Digital is n't the first global company to look toward Madison Avenue for help in securing a single brand identity .
In fact , a Digital competitor , International Business Machines , earlier this year surprised the advertising community when it fired about 40 agencies in a single motion and hired WPP Group 's Ogilvy & Mather to handle its world-wide advertising , estimated to be in excess of $ 300 million .
Charlie Holleran , vice president of communications at Digital , says Needham 's experience with NEC `` was probably a factor in getting them on the long list of 30 agencies we looked at when we began the search .
But what clients the final agencies serviced became less important .
'' Mr. Holleran concedes that once having NEC as a client will help Needham `` sort through what is going to be a complex partner .
'' It is unclear , executives at Digital and Needham say , whether the ads that won the agency the account , which included print and television commercials , will be used in the actual campaign , which will be a fully integrated effort , including media advertising and direct mail .
Recently , Digital has n't been a major advertiser , except for its personal-computer ads from Young & Rubicam with the slogan , `` Beyond the Box .
'' If it was difficult to reach anyone at Needham yesterday in the late afternoon , the reason was understandable : Agency employees celebrated the win at the Eatery , the in-house restaurant on the second floor of Needham 's Madison Avenue offices .
Naturally , champagne was served .
Buoyed by increasing confidence in the economic recovery , advertising expenditures world-wide are expected to grow by 5.5 % to $ 235 billion this year , according to a forecast by Saatchi & Saatchi 's New York office .
Spending in 1993 rose 3.4 % to $ 222.7 billion , the agency said , which was below its earlier forecast of 4 % made last December .
Spending for 1995 is expected to increase by 7.4 % , up from an earlier forecast of 6.4 % , and by 8.8 % in 1996 , the agency said .
In the U.S. , ad expenditures are expected to increase 3.3 % in 1994 and 4.2 % in 1995 .
In Europe , spending is projected to grow at a faster pace , 5.4 % in 1994 and 8.1 % in 1995 .
Spending in China is rising at an especially rapid rate , Saatchi said , and that country is expected to become the world 's fifth-largest advertising market in 1996 .
NEW YORK -- Cyclical stocks exploded , lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its highest level since March 23 .
A moderate advance much of the session , inspired by a second day of stability in the dollar , burst into a powerful rally as bond prices surged late in the day .
The Industrials jumped 70.90 , or 1.88 % , to 3846.73 , their biggest one-day rise since April 5 .

LONDON -- For weeks , the Ghost Club of Britain had been planning an all-night investigation at an abbey in Hampshire , hoping for proof of spirits .
Before they got started , though , something spooky happened .
A tipster telephoned police with a warning : The ghost hunters were really members of an Irish Republican Army terrorist cell .
So the police conducted their own investigation .
Bill Bellars , the 75-year-old retired military officer who planned the outing , was visited by Scotland Yard .
It took him an afternoon to convince police that the group was up to nothing more nefarious than looking for the spirits of a handful of 16th-century Cistercian monks .
The ghost hunt eventually went ahead as planned , but the mystery of the tipster 's identity has n't been solved .
Nor does Mr. Bellars know the source of the abusive calls he began getting at home earlier this year .
He does know this : Investigating the afterlife has n't been the same since dissident members of the 132-year-old Ghost Club of Britain formed a rival squad .
This tale of the supernatural has an all-too-human theme : how jealousy and ego have turned friends into enemies , threatening the future of a secret society that has counted Charles Dickens , W.B. Yeats and Aldous Huxley among its members .
Mr. Bellars blames the dissidents for the IRA call .
`` I mean , blimey , how low can we get ?
It 's pathetic , '' he says .
`` It 's extremely unlikely that a retired member of the Royal Navy would be a member of the IRA .
'' Peter Underwood , a 60-year-old writer on the supernatural whose ouster as club president led to the split , spiritedly denies any connection to the phone calls or the IRA incident .
Mr. Underwood , whose new Ghost Club Society is thriving , says the original club will `` die a natural death '' because of its directors ' neglect .
Ghosts are serious business here .
Whether because of the country 's age , bloody past or foggy weather , Britain has more ghosts than any other country , enthusiasts say .
Estimates reach into the thousands .
Rare is the decent-sized English town that ca n't boast its own ghost guidebook .
Homes believed to be haunted often fetch hefty prices .
`` There 's a certain history , a certain romance with ghosts , '' says Ian Homersham , a London real-estate agent .
`` It suggests age and dignity .
'' As recently as two years ago , the Ghost Club of Britain , founded in 1862 , was the most prestigious group of ghost-hunters in the world .
Its monthly meetings drew eminent scientists and psychics , and its investigations of castles and pubs were legendary .
It scouted out the ghostly gypsies and monks of Pluckley Village in Kent , charted the spirits at an Elizabethan hunting lodge and tracked a ghost nun said to appear every July 28 at Borley Rectory in Essex .
The club , naturally , has had difficulty proving these ghosts ' existence conclusively .
Evidence includes interviews with residents and guards at stately old homes , plus eyewitness reports in archives .
On rare occasions , members say , they have heard a noise or felt a mysterious breeze .
The unraveling of the Ghost Club began about 10 months ago .
Although Mr. Underwood had been president for 33 years , some members wearied of what they called his heavy-handed rule .
`` It was an autocracy , '' says member Ruth Jarvis , who traces her interest in ghosts to a sighting during preschool .
`` You could never suggest anything on your own .
Everything had to be Peter 's idea .
'' New members were admitted without a vote by the group , the dissidents complain , adding that at one point Mr. Underwood refused to say how many members the club had .
Mr. Bellars and his supporters also felt that Mr. Underwood -- author of more than 30 books , including `` The Ghosthunters Almanac '' and `` The Vampire 's Bedside Companion '' -- used the club 's name to help sell his books .
`` He really ran it to suit his own commercial interests , '' says Mr. Bellars , formerly chief investigations officer .
He confronted Mr. Underwood at a meeting last fall .
`` I said my piece , then he went purple in the face , just blew a top , '' Mr. Bellars says .
`` Then he vanished .
'' Well , not exactly .
Mr. Underwood formed his own club a few months later .
He attracted about a third of the Ghost Club of Britain 's members by arguing that it had ossified after he left .
Mr. Underwood concedes he used to run the club with a strong hand , but denies he exploited his presidency .
The club 's informality meant some decisions were made without a vote , he says .
And as for using the club 's name in his books , `` There 's no copyright to the Ghost Club name .
It 's always been a very informal club , very friendly .
'' Mr. Underwood 's new Ghost Club Society boasts 80 members , more than double the active members in the original club , and has a packed schedule of investigations .
But the original group , which once gathered regularly at a regal supper club in central London , has n't met or had a full-blown ghost hunt in months .
When asked to talk about it , Mr. Bellars squints and plumbs his memory for great hunts of the past .
But he and others are trying to bring the old club back to life .
Tom Perrott , an affable retired personnel manager , recently returned as chairman .
`` We are hell-bent on encouraging suitable members to apply , '' says Mr. Perrott , who admits , somewhat sheepishly , that he has never seen a ghost himself .
And Mr. Bellars is laying the groundwork for a ghost-hunting he hopes will upstage his rival .
A recent afternoon finds him huffing his way down a cantilevered staircase in a drafty 17th-century mansion .
Just off the landing , he pauses in midstep and draws a long , deep breath .
`` Something happened here , '' he says , `` no doubt about it .
'' The site , he notes , is the precise spot visited 27 years ago by Mr. Underwood , and is said to be haunted by the grown-up spirit of a baby tossed off the balcony in a dispute 300 years ago .
Despite elaborate preparations during that previous investigation -- the team sealed doorways with cotton , installed a bevy of cameras , even slathered the staircase railings with petroleum jelly to turn up any spiritual fingerprints -- no ghost was spotted .
Mr. Bellars knows a successful hunt by his clan would mean embarrassment for his rival .
`` We are the original , '' he proclaims , back straight and chin out .
`` Let that never be forgotten .
'' NEW YORK -- Stellar demand at the government 's auction of new five-year notes brought a wide range of buyers back into the bond market yesterday and boosted prices of Treasury securities .
`` There was significantly greater demand than anybody truly anticipated , '' said Peter Hirsch , head of government-bond trading at Salomon Brothers Inc. .
He attributed the demand to `` a lot of pent-up buying .
'' The demand was `` an outstanding leap of faith for the market , '' he said .
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose nearly a point , or nearly $ 10 for a bond with a $ 1,000 face value , to 100 13\/32 .
Its yield , which moves in the opposite direction from its price , dropped to 7.45 % from 7.54 % on Tuesday .
Because many institutional investors have remained cautious toward the bond market , most traders had expected only tepid demand for the Treasury 's $ 11.01 billion five-year note auction .
Instead , dealers were surprised when both large and small investors turned out in force .
Buyers were encouraged by the perception that the Federal Reserve wo n't raise interest rates again until November .
In addition , the auction was the last note offering until late September , and investors wanted a piece of the pie before there was n't any left .
`` There is definitely buying from larger accounts going on out there , '' said James Awad , president of Awad & Associates , a New York capital-management firm .
`` There certainly is n't a tidal wave yet , but we are seeing the beginning of people coming back into the market .
'' Meanwhile an innovative Texas municipal-bond issue set up to encourage bids by minority-owned and women-owned underwriting firms had unexpected results .
Lehman Brothers Inc. walked away with most of the $ 1.7 billion in tax and revenue anticipation notes after bidding much more aggressively than other firms , including the minority firms .
Data showing unexpectedly weak activity in the manufacturing sector bolstered the bond market early in the day .
The Commerce Department reported that durable-goods orders plunged 4.2 % in July .
Market analysts had been calling for durables to post a flat reading for last month .
Economists were quick to note , however , that the bulk of the decline was due to temporary auto-plant shutdowns and that the data do n't necessarily reflect an underlying slowdown in manufacturing activity .
`` The trend in the economy is still toward stronger growth , '' said Mary Dennis , a money-market economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. `` The durables number did n't change that view .
'' While analysts warned against reading too much into the decline in durable-goods orders , the report nevertheless started the ball rolling for the bond market 's rally .
Buying picked up steam after stronger-than-expected demand emerged at the five-year note auction .
The Treasury Department awarded the five-year notes at a yield of 6.91 % , a lower yield than most traders had expected .
The coupon was set at 6.875 % .
The bid-to-cover ratio , which is a measure of demand comparing the total number of bids tendered to the number received , was a hefty 3.22-to-1 .
The level of noncompetitive bids , which typically reflect interest from smaller investors , was on the low side at $ 809 million .
`` There is growing optimism that the Fed wo n't be hanging over the market like a dark cloud and that supply is not a problem going forward , '' said Lee Quaintance , head of government trading at CS First Boston Corp. `` The auction did extremely well .
'' Margaret Patel , portfolio manager for the Advantage Government Securities Bond Fund in Boston , attributed the unexpectedly aggressive bidding at the fiveyear auction to money managers looking to extend into slightly longer maturities without taking on significantly greater risk .
`` The five-year offered people the best of both worlds , '' said Ms. Patel .
The yield on the new five-year note fell after the auction results were announced , reflecting strengthening demand for the issue .
Late yesterday , the when-issued five-year note yielded 6.86 % , down from 6.95 % late Tuesday .
Although there was legitimate demand for the five-year note yesterday , some traders stressed that the scope of the market 's rally was in part a reflection of thin conditions in the market .
In addition , the push higher was exaggerated by a scramble among dealers to cover short positions , they said .
In covering a short sale , a trader buys back securities that had been sold earlier in a bet that prices would fall .
However Mr. Hirsch of Salomon contended that thin trading conditions and short-covering did n't significantly exaggerate the market 's reaction to strong demand at the Treasury auction .
`` You really have to have a real large amount of buying '' to fuel a rally like this , he said .
`` I am always skeptical about the short-covering argument .
'' But even Mr. Hirsch does n't expect the rally to continue very long .
Another positive for the bond market yesterday was stability in the dollar .
Declines in the U.S. currency against the yen had undercut the bond market in recent days .
A weak dollar reduces demand by foreign investors for dollar-denominated securities .
Despite yesterday 's rally , investors continue to be cautious .
Unless economic activity slows significantly , the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again later this year .
As a result , investors said they are timing their purchases carefully and attempting to avoid chasing prices higher .
`` While the market 's performance has created a sense of urgency to lock in yields at coming levels , it 's still a bear market , '' said Hugh Johnson , chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. .
All bids are awarded at a single price at the market-clearing yield .
Rates are determined by the difference between that price and the face value .
The notes are dated Aug. 31 , and mature Aug. 31 , 1999 .
An innovative Texas municipal bond issue set up to encourage bids by minority and women-owned underwriting firms went off the rails slightly yesterday , as Lehman Brothers walked away with most of the $ 1.7 billion in tax and revenue anticipation notes .
The Texas issue had been widely watched because of the state 's determination to offer $ 200 million of the issue to women-owned or minority-owned firms .
But those firms were required to bid with yields below the yield of the weighted average bid on the deal , so that they would n't be getting the bonds at an unfairly low price .
When Lehman charged in with an unexpectedly aggressive bid with a 4.00 % net interest cost , most of the smaller firms found themselves undercut .
According to the rules of the issue , once most of the minority-owned and woman-owned firms had been eliminated , the $ 200 million returned to the regular bidding process .
In the end , Lehman took away $ 1.698 billion of the notes , leaving $ 2 million for Dallas-based Friedman , Luzzatto & Co. , which is owned by a woman .
Grigsby Branford Inc. , a black-owned firm , did join the Lehman bid , but a Grigsby source said the firm 's role was minor , and it would probably take only $ 20 million of the bonds .
Lehman said it was happy with the deal 's outcome .
`` We like the credit '' of Texas , said one municipal specialist at the firm .
And Texas also said it was satisfied .
Texas Assistant Deputy Treasurer John Bell said that the state is `` very pleased '' with the outcome of the sale .
The low winning bid , he added , is `` good for us .
'' Would future debt sales also have securities set aside for women and minority-owned firms ?
`` We 're going to evaluate '' this sale 's results , said Mr. Bell .
One trader at a minority-owned firm questioned whether such set-asides were necessary at all on competitive deals , in which firms compete solely on the basis of price .
`` I appreciate what they were doing , but I do n't think it was necessary .
On competitive deals , I do n't see minorities not having access to bonds , '' he said .
The TRANs , which have a 5 % coupon and mature Aug. 31 , 1995 , have not yet been reoffered .
Meanwhile , Moody 's Investors Service Inc. confirmed its conditional Baa rating of Denver International Airport bonds , ahead of a planned sale Aug. 30 of $ 225 million in new DIA bonds , and a day after Fitch Investors Service Inc. downgraded the airport paper to triple-B-minus .
Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group also confirmed its double-B rating on DIA bonds .
The airport debt was given an extra glow by the tentative settlement to a spat between United Airlines , a unit of UAL Corp. , and the city of Denver , over Denver 's decision to back up a failing automated baggage system with a conventional conveyor-belt system .
United , which is scheduled to use the largest number of gates at the new airport , will spend $ 10 million to $ 20 million trying to fix its own portion of the automated system ahead of the airport 's Feb. 28 opening date .
The junk bonds of Viacom Inc. and Rally 's Hamburgers Inc. both traded up dramatically on positive news in an otherwise slow corporate market .
New issuance remained sluggish with only three companies tapping the market with deals totaling $ 285 million .
Savings-and-loan concern H.F. Ahmanson & Co. sold $ 125 million of 10-year noncallable subordinated notes at 99.534 to yield 7.943 % .
And Applied Materials Inc. issued $ 100 million of 10-year noncallable senior notes at 99.269 to yield 8.108 % .
Applied Materials makes semiconductor-wafer fabrication equipment .
Trading in the investment-grade market was quiet with market players watching prices rally with Treasurys .
Spreads were unchanged to slightly tighter , traders said .
Rally 's saw its 9.875 % coupon senior notes maturing in 2000 trade up 12.5 points to 65.5 .
The yield dropped to 20 % from 26 % , one trader said .
The improvement occurred after Giant Group Ltd. announced its agreement to buy 2.5 million common shares of Rally 's for $ 10 million , increasing its stake in the fast-food restaurant operator to 46.9 % of outstanding common .
Separately , Viacom 's debt improved dramatically after Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. 's board reaffirmed its approval of the proposed takeover by Viacom .
Blockbuster 's board also voted unanimously to put the acquisition before a shareholder vote .
Viacom 's 8 % coupon debt maturing in 2006 traded up 5.5 points to 82 .
Prices of mortgage-backed securities ended 1\/4 to 3\/8 higher , buoyed by the rally in Treasurys .
With mortgages climbing higher on top of 1\/4-point gains Tuesday , mortgage prices are back at levels touched in the rally Aug. 16 after the Federal Reserve raised the federal-funds rate , the rate on overnight loans between banks .
Several investors stepped into the market yesterday , buying on improved bond-market sentiment , traders said .
The strongest bid was for the current-coupon 8 % and 8.5 % securities , traders said .
Current-coupon securities are backed by the most recently created mortgage loans .
If the dollar maintains ground against the yen , the mortgage market should continue to perform well , said Robert Davidson , manager of a $ 650 million mortgage-bond portfolio at Van Kampen Merritt .
In addition , several market players had priced in a flatter yield curve in the wake of the increase in the federal-funds rate .
A flatter yield curve hurts mortgage securities because it results in a lower yield spread between mortgages and Treasurys .
But as short-term interest rates have n't risen by as much as had been anticipated , investors have bid up prices of mortgage-backed bonds , said Mr. Davidson .
In secondary trading , Government National Mortgage Association 8 % issues for September delivery ended 14\/32 higher at 99 5\/32 .
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 8 % Gold issues ended 12\/32 higher at 99 12\/32 .
Federal National Mortgage Association 8 % issues ended 12\/32 higher at 99 12\/32 .

ARMONK , N.Y. -- International Business Machines Corp. , as expected , slashed prices as much as 27 % on most of its business personal computers , undercutting recent price moves by Compaq Computer Corp. , which reduced prices last week as much as 22 % .
The IBM cuts , which took effect yesterday , most dramatically affect servers , which are PCs that businesses use to network smaller computers .
Also affected are the commercial desktop brands , PS\/2 and ValuePoint , and one ThinkPad subnotebook model .
The consumer brands PS\/1 and ThinkPad 750C , which remain in short supply , are n't affected .
The biggest price change for IBM means a Server 95 running on a 486 array Intel chip with 16 megabytes of memory now lists for $ 9,500 , down from $ 13,090 .
The Compaq ProLiant 1000 server , a comparable model , sells for $ 10,000 , about 5 % more than the IBM server .
As reported , IBM said it had planned to reduce prices on the current products to clear the way for an overhaul of its PC product line next month , but the timing of the announcement was driven by Compaq 's cuts .
The State Department will deny further export permits to one of Lockheed Corp. 's aircraft units until the company has been cleared of charges that it made illegal foreign payments to an Egyptian official .
The company , which notified the Securities and Exchange Commission of the development through a filing , said the government ban applies only to future applications for arms exports from Lockheed Aeronautical Systems , based in Marietta , Ga. .
That division makes the P-3 submarine-hunting plane and the C-130 transport , including a new variant called the C-130J that Lockheed hopes will win substantial sales in Europe and elsewhere overseas .
Lockheed 's foreign sales in 1993 came to $ 681 million , or 5.5 % of the Calabasas , Calif. , arms maker 's total sales of $ 13.07 billion .
Neither Lockheed nor department officials could clarify whether the ban would affect Lockheed 's campaign to sell 30 of the new C-130 variants in the United Kingdom and a dozen of the planes in Australia .
A State Department official confirmed the action , and noted that the ban affects only Lockheed export-license applications submitted after the June 22 indictment .
The official also said exceptions to the denial may be granted on a case-by-case basis .
Lockheed also has the option of requesting a restoration of its permission to export , or appealing any denial of a license through administrative channels .
Lockheed issued a statement saying it `` emphatically '' denies the allegations made in the June indictment , which charged that Lockheed and two former executives made illegal payments to a member of the Egyptian parliament in 1989 to land sales of the C-130 there .
In both its SEC filing and its public statement , Lockheed said it is `` disappointed that any action has been taken against any Lockheed entity on the basis of unproven accusations .
'' Some industry observers believe that given the various avenues for Lockheed to appeal rejections of its license application , the real effect of the ban is to enact closer federal scrutiny of exports attempted by the aeronautical-systems unit .
The division accounted for $ 1.8 billion of Lockheed 's overall $ 6.9 billion in new contracts won last year .
Lockheed or the affected aircraft unit also could face suspension from new Air Force contracts because of the indictment , which charged that the company and its former executives concealed payments to Leila I. Takla , a former member of the Egyptian Parliament .
The payments allegedly relate to Lockheed 's sale of three C-130 transports to Egypt for $ 79 million .
FOR A LOT of people -- even smart , successful people -- the process of shopping for a PC ranks right up there with car-buying as a vision of Consumer Hell .
It 's true that computer sales clerks are n't likely to offer to throw in free floor mats if you 'll take the lime-green model with fake wood trim .
But at least car sales people mainly exaggerate in terms you can understand .
Everybody knows what power windows are -- the kind made at glass factories , not at Microsoft .
Plus , you can usually eyeball most of the features .
And you can take a car for a test drive .
Walk into a computer store , however , and you instantly feel stupid , even if you 're known to the rest of the world as a genius at whatever else you do .
All the machines pretty much look the same : gray boxes of various sizes with a lot of very important-looking stuff displayed on their screens .
Their distinguishing features are hidden from view and identified only by a cascade of technobabble terminology .
There 's little chance to test-drive the computers , and you 're gripped with the fear that whatever you buy will be obsolete within weeks , unable even to run the next version of electronic solitaire .
So , with school starting and another PC price war breaking out , it seems sensible to offer up a couple of columns to help computer shoppers -- a sort of `` Guide to the PC Perplexed .
'' This week , I 'll present a brief glossary of some common computer terms and acronyms .
Next week , I 'll lay out my annual recommendations on how much computing power and capacity you should buy for personal and small-business use .
The most confusing computer concepts for many people are memory and disk storage .
Both describe the capacity of a computer to retain data -- whether that data is a software program you buy or something you create , such as a memo , picture or mailing list .
And both are measured in the same tongue-twisting units : kilobytes , or KB -- roughly equal to 1,000 typed characters , or 150 to 200 words ; and megabytes , MB or `` megs '' -- equal to 1,000 kilobytes , or roughly a million typed characters .
BY WAY OF example , the text of this column is about six kilobytes in size , while you could fit a pretty hefty novel into a single megabyte .
But memory and storage are different things entirely .
Memory -- or RAM , for random access memory -- is the temporary capacity of a computer to store data at any given moment .
It is located on chips deep inside the machine , but the data stored in them is erased once you turn the computer off .
And it usually totals a relatively small number of megabytes -- say , four or eight .
Disk storage is usually much larger -- at least 200 megabytes these days -- and , as the term implies , it does n't use chips but instead encodes data on spinning platters coated with magnetic materials similar to what 's used on audio or video tapes .
They record the same kind of information held in memory chips , but they retain it when the power goes off .
Without enough memory and disk storage , a PC can be crippled no matter how new it is .
The latest software requires generous amounts of both .
Think of memory as being roughly analogous to the temporary assembly of documents on your desk for completing a project .
Disk storage , in contrast , is more like a file cabinet in which you permanently store the documents .
When you open a word-processor file , you are transferring it from a disk into the computer 's memory chips , where it resides as you edit , read or print it .
When you save a file you 've created , you 're copying it from the memory chips to long-term disk storage .
TO ADD TO the confusion , there are different kinds of disk storage .
A hard disk drive is a PC 's principal longterm data repository .
It contains one or more fast-spinning platters sealed in a box tucked away in the machine .
A floppy disk is actually a fairly rigid 3.5-inch plastic square -LRB- the floppy , circular part is inside the plastic shell -RRB- that holds up to 1.44 megabytes of data .
The computer reads these portable disks via a floppy disk drive -- the slot into which you pop the disks .
The hottest form of disk storage is called CD-ROM , for compact disk-read only memory .
These removable disks are small , shiny platters that look exactly like music CDs , but can store a whopping 600 megabytes or more of computer data for far less cost than a hard disk .
The catch is that you ca n't save any of your own data to a CD-ROM disk .
Your PC can only read the data that came on them -- thus the ROM , or read-only , part of the title .
Most PCs now come with CD-ROM drives for reading these disks .
The standard type of CD-ROM drive today is called double speed -LRB- 2X -RRB- , which only means it 's twice as fast as the first generation in certain ways .
A computer 's main chip , its central brain , is usually called a CPU , or central processing unit .
These come in too many varieties to list here , but on IBM-compatible PCs , the mainstream type is a 486 and the fastest current CPU is a Pentium .
On Apple 's Macintosh machines , the mainstream CPU is a 68040 and the speed demon is a PowerPC .
Even a PC 's video has its own terminology .
VGA is the basic standard type , while Super VGA , or SVGA , offers greater resolution .
Local bus video means the video is driven by special , high-speed circuitry inside .
These terms , of course , hardly exhaust the technobabble arsenal of a skilled PC peddler .
But learning them will give you a start when you head to the dealership to kick the tires on that '94 Compaq with power Windows .
WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is expected to seek an embezzlement indictment against former White House travel office head Billy Dale , according to people familiar with the case .
But government lawyers and Mr. Dale 's new attorney have agreed to again stop the clock on the statute of limitations in the case in order to have more discussions .
Mr. Dale is likely to argue that unaccounted-for funds from the travel office were used for unexpected contingencies to smooth the way for the White House press corps as its members traveled with the president , especially abroad .
None of it was public money ; the office uses funds from media organizations to arrange press travel for presidential trips .
The investigation by the Justice Department 's public integrity section was requested by the White House after it fired all seven travel office employees in May 1993 for alleged financial mismanagement .
An internal review cleared five of the workers , who were rehired in other parts of the government .
The firings were ordered by then-White House aide David Watkins , who resigned earlier this year after it was revealed that he had used a government helicopter to travel to a Maryland golf course .
The possible indictment of Mr. Dale was first reported yesterday in the Washington Times .

The Mexico City market surged on a wave of euphoria about economic continuity under the coming new administration .
World-wide , stock prices rose in dollar terms .
The Dow Jones World Stock Index was at 118.97 , up 0.28 , reflecting higher markets in the Americas and Europe and lower Asia\/Pacific markets .
Forest-products stocks were the top gainers in the Dow Jones World Industry Groups , closing at 155.52 , up 4.33 , or 2.9 % , with Georgia-Pacific of the U.S. posting a 5.2 % gain in its local currency .
Biotechnology stocks trailed at 79.66 , down 1.36 , or 1.7 % , with Biomira of Canada sliding 5.7 % in local currency .
In Tokyo , the Nikkei 225-stock index , which fell 13.80 points Tuesday , advanced 130.82 to 20511.60 , snapping a string of three declines .
In trading Thursday , the Nikkei index edged up 2.10 points to close the morning session at 20513.70 .

Gainers topped losers , 565-423 .
The Tokyo Stock Price Index , or Topix , of all first-section issues , which dropped 5.66 points Tuesday , rose 6.91 to 1638.70 .
Public funds increased their visibility , and pension funds made selective purchases .
A late rally was triggered by futures-led index buying , spurred by the dollar 's climb against the yen .
Helped partly by the large flow of public funds , the Nikkei tested 20500 a few times during the session , only to be weighed down by selling pressure from profit-taking ; foreign investors were net sellers and Japanese institutions unloaded shares to snag profits .
As futures prices climbed toward the close , though , a barrage of arbitrage buying drove the Nikkei up to finish comfortably above 20500 .
In London , the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rallied 30.1 points to 3205.2 , just a tenth of a point off the intraday high and up sharply from the session low of 3181.1 .
The FT 30-stock index climbed 17.8 points to 2507.5 .
Volume was 701.6 million shares , up from 554.7 million shares a day earlier .
Equities traded in positive territory throughout the day on buoyant stock-index futures .
The rally was temporarily upset when European bonds turned down after a report that regional German consumer inflation was initially interpreted as higher than expected .
But stocks got a late boost when Wall Street opened higher on a U.S. economic report favorable to inflation trends .
The late London surge pushed the FT-100 above a perceived resistance level of 3200 , with seven in 10 stocks in the index advancing , led by food retailers and electric utilities .
In Frankfurt , the DAX 30-stock index gained 18.50 points to 2126.37 .
The market also was helped by firmer German government-bond prices and some favorably received corporate news .
The stock and bond markets were initially damped and then aided by news that the two largest western German states ' inflation rates in August accelerated slightly but were in line with expectations .
And the German government reported its largest trade surplus this year , 8.4 billion marks -LRB- $ 5.48 billion -RRB- , for June and a sharp narrowing of the currentaccount deficit to just 100 million marks .
In Paris , stocks edged higher in thin trading as the August trading account closed uneventfully , boosted a bit by firmness in the bond market and futures and by a slight rebound in the dollar .

In Brussels , prices rose on Wall Street 's continued rebound , which helped lift a bearish tone in Europe .
In Mexico City , stocks rallied 1.6 % , fueled by booming investor confidence after Sunday 's presidential elections .
Prices reversed losses earlier in the day that stemmed from profit-taking and a surprise increase in key Mexican rates .
In Sydney , shares rose , led by blue chips , as investors focused on corporate results and overseas markets .
In Hong Kong , prices finished slightly higher , after recovering most early losses on late bargain-hunting ; early weakness followed unexpectedly poor sales at a government land auction Tuesday .

WASHINGTON -- CIT Group\/Sales Financing Inc. of Livingston , N.J. , agreed to pay $ 150,000 to settle government charges that it discriminated against unmarried co-applicants for mobile-home loans and other loans .
In a complaint filed in federal district court in New Jersey , the Federal Trade Commision alleged that during a five-year period , CIT refused to take into consideration incomes of both unmarried co-applicants seeking loans , even though it considered the combined incomes of married co-applicants .
CIT 's actions violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1991 , which prohibits discrimination on the basis of marital status , among other things .
A spokesman for CIT said the company agreed to the settlement to avoid court costs and business disruptions .
He said the company denies that it discriminated against any loan applicants .
Under the consent decree , CIT agreed to pay the civil penalties within five days .
The company also agreed to follow FTC requirements for fair lending and to be monitored by the FTC to ensure its compliance .
CIT is a subsidiary of CIT Group Holding Inc. , which is 60 % - owned by Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. , Japan , and 40 % - owned by Chemical Banking Corp. , New York .
WASHINGTON -- Chrysler Corp. plans to recall all of its Jeep Wranglers because of potential fuel-tank leaks , and General Motors Corp. said it will recall 67,000 Cadillacs because of potential engine fires .
Chrysler 's Wranglers came under scrutiny from federal auto-safety officials last year after auto-emissions testers in California noticed cracked gaskets at the top of the utility vehicles ' plastic fuel tanks .
Chrysler found that some of the gaskets , which connect the fuel tank to a unit that holds the fuel pump , had been tightened too much during assembly .
A Chrysler spokeswoman said the compression from the overtightened gaskets `` could result in fuel-vapor levels exceeding emissions standards , '' and could create a fuel leak if the tank is overfilled or the Wrangler is in a severe crash .
But she said the car maker has no reports of fuel leaks or injuries .
There are 230,000 Wranglers on the road , built from 1987 through the present .
Chrysler said it will notify owners of the recall in writing , and will solve the problem by replacing the gaskets .
Meanwhile , GM said it is recalling about 67,000 1993-94 Cadillac Seville Touring Sedans and Eldorado Touring Coupes and 1993 Cadillac Allantes because of improperly routed oil-cooler lines in their engines that have resulted in fires , and on two occasions , injuries .
A GM spokesman said the company has received 30 complaints related to this recall with 24 of those involving fires , including two that burned drivers .
GM said the problem occurs when a rotating part on a vehicle 's air conditioner clutch assembly cuts a hole in an oil-cooling hose .
Oil then can spill onto the hot engine , where it can ignite .
GM plans to fix the problem by identifying those vehicles that have their oil-cooling hoses placed too close to the air conditioner 's clutch assembly .
Those hoses will then be replaced , rerouted and secured with a plastic tie strap .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , which had opened an investigation of Cadillac engine fires last month , also revealed yesterday that it has stepped up an investigation of engine fires in GM 's small and large pickups , model years 1989 through 1993 .
The agency said it has 216 reports of engine fires tracing to malfunctioning alternators in the pickups , and 262 fires of unknown origin .
The reports , most of which came from GM , included 11 reports of injuries .
A GM spokesman said the company does n't believe the alternator failures are a `` safety defect , '' and notes that drivers get an engine-light warning when an alternator seizes .
Separately , the agency said it has stepped up an investigation of the antilock-braking systems of Chrysler minivans from 1991 though 1993 .
The agency said it has 837 complaints about long stopping distances , or loss of braking ability , out of 254,185 vehicles on the road .
A Chrysler spokesman said the company had two recalls in 1991 to fix hose and pump problems that limited the minivans ' braking ability .
He said complaints have dropped off since then , and speculated that many of the agency 's reports either came in before the recall , or involve vehicles whose owners missed the recall .
The agency has also begun investigations into 1991 BMW 525s and 1993 Honda Civics after receiving a handful of reports of steering systems locking up while the cars are in motion .

PALO ALTO , Calif. -- Syntex Corp. said Roche Holding Ltd. of Switzerland has extended for a third time the deadline of its tender offer for shares of Syntex .
Syntex said the extension to next Wednesday from yesterday was to allow for the completion of a previously reported probe into the acquisition by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission .
Roche said last May that it agreed to pay $ 24 a share , or $ 5.3 billion , for Syntex , a pharmaceutical company .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average roared through the longstanding 3800 barrier to reach its highest level since March 23 .
Some traders said the breadth and power of the rally , which drew strength from a strong bond market and a firming dollar , suggest it has further to go .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average made its largest single-day gain since April 5 , surging 70.90 to 3846.73 .
The industrial average , which had n't closed above 3800 since June 16 , has added 91.62 points , or 2.4 % , just this week .
The blue-chip indicator is up 2.47 % for the year , but still below its Jan. 31 high of 3978.36 .
Other major stock indexes also rallied , albeit not as strongly .
The Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index climbed 4.52 to 469.03 and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 3.74 to 751.72 .
`` There was a significant rotation into the cyclical groups , which people on Wall Street thought were dead , '' said Larry Rice , chief market strategist at Josephthal Lyon & Ross .
`` And that move continues to support the summer rally we were anticipating .
I fully expect we 'll hold this rally through Labor Day .
'' The powerful rally marked the first time since April 25 that the New York Stock Exchange invoked its 50-point rule that slows computerized program trading .
Traders said the dollar 's gains and the bond market 's recent stability had cleared the decks for a stock-market rally .
But the strength of the advance caught the massive group of short-sellers , who have been betting on further stock-market declines , off guard , analysts said .
In the final 30 minutes , the industrial average hesitated and retreated modestly from its substantial gains , then quickly resumed its upward track .
At that point , traders said , short-covering became furious , pushing prices sharply higher .
With short-interest at an all-time high for several months , some analysts already had predicted a sharp upward move could force short-sellers to cover positions quickly , prompting a bigger breakout .
`` A lot of the action in the past two days has come from short-sellers getting squeezed , especially in the cyclical issues , '' said Doug Kass , director of institutional equities at JW Charles in Boca Raton , Fla. `` A lot of people went short on the cyclical issues thinking that the Federal Reserve would do all it could to slow down the economy , and that strategy is sort of backfiring .
'' But the intensity of short-covering and its role yesterday led several analysts to wonder how long the rally could last .
`` A lot of people feel that a rally fueled by short-covering may be more vulnerable , '' said Elliott Platt , director of economic research at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette .
`` But I 'm not sure that 's accurate .
If people did n't think the market was going higher , why should they cover their short positions ?
'' Stock prices received initial support from the still-strengthening dollar .
Though the currency continues to trade below levels held before the Federal Reserve 's credit tightening last week , it staged a strong recovery in the past two days .
`` Based on the fundamentals that show our economy performing stronger than the Japanese and German economies , the dollar was being oversold , '' said Mr. Platt .
`` Also , the dollar should continue to firm because inflation has n't become the problem in our economy that many traders anticipated .
'' The strengthening dollar and receding fears of inflation have helped the bond market gain ground during the past two sessions .
In addition , yesterday 's auction of $ 11.01 billion in five-year notes went better than expected and the Commerce Department 's durable-goods-data report was weaker than expected .
Analysts said the surprising strength of the auction not only gave bonds a nudge upward but also prompted several dealers to scramble to cover short positions , helping to push bond prices higher across the board .
Traders noted that much of the movements came on thin volume , exaggerating the impact of the short-covering .
World-wide , stock prices rose in dollar terms .
The Dow Jones World Stock Index gained 0.28 to 118.97 .
Stock prices rose .
Volume totaled 309.8 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange , where 1,379 issues advanced and 814 declined .
Bond prices gained .
The Treasury 's benchmark 30-year issue rose nearly a point , or almost $ 10 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to yield 7.45 % .
The dollar strengthened .
In late New York trading , the currency was quoted at 1.5461 marks and 99 yen , compared with 1.5325 marks and 97.98 yen Tuesday .
FAIRFAX , Va. -- ICF Kaiser International Inc. said it is in talks to acquire Geo-Con Inc. , an environmental remediation and speciality construction company .

Closely held Geo-Con , based in Monroeville , Pa. , had revenue of $ 50 million last year .
ICF Kaiser is a large engineering construction and consulting services company with annual revenue of $ 650 million .
The acquisition , subject to certain approvals , is expected to be completed this fall .
As George Wallace turns 75 today , it 's time to recognize that , despite his climb to national notoriety as the embodiment of racism , he has become , in the words of Columbia University Prof. Alan Brinkley , `` one of the 20th century 's most important political figures .
'' For better or worse , Mr. Wallace -- four-time governor of Alabama and , historically more important , four-time candidate for president -- is the most influential loser in modern American politics .
Mr. Wallace is the politician who sensed in the American electorate the sea change by which every successful candidate for the presidency since 1968 has charted his course : a distrust of Washington and the national media ; a feeling that government cared only for the very rich or the very poor ; a perception that no one in authority was responding to civil disorder ; and a fear that America had lost its moral compass .
Similarly , the political canon that Mr. Wallace articulated in his presidential campaigns -- most effectively in 1968 , when his candidacy divided the Democratic vote and helped to defeat Hubert Humphrey -- has since become the mainstream of American politics : a quest for law and order ; tax breaks for the middle class , but a requirement for the `` super-rich '' to `` pay their fair share '' ; antagonism toward Washington bureaucrats ; and a reliance on `` common folks with common sense '' to chart our moral course rather than `` pointy-headed pseudo-intellectuals .
'' Through some Machiavellian wizardry , Mr. Wallace felt the needs and longings of the faceless multitude , and he became its voice .
He sought votes not just for himself but also as a means of smiting the mighty Establishment -- to `` Send Them a Message , '' as his 1972 campaign slogan put it .
Joe Azbell , Mr. Wallace 's longtime publicist -LRB- and coiner of the slogan -RRB- , said recently of his old boss : `` He knew where to find the itch -- and he scratched it .
'' In Mr. Wallace 's gubernatorial campaigns , the itch he scratched to obtain office was the fear and uncertainty among Alabama 's whites over the crumbling of segregation , and he would be stained by his bellicose defense of an inherently evil system .
The name George Wallace will always evoke the image of a defiant obstructionist shouting `` Segregation forever !
'' and , with jutted jaw and curled lip , posturing at the schoolhouse door in a vain , puerile attempt to turn the tide of equal opportunity .
Ironically , Mr. Wallace 's strident opposition to integration hastened its implementation .
John Kennedy was reluctant to submit a civil-rights bill to Congress until Mr. Wallace tried to keep two black students from enrolling in the University of Alabama in 1963 .
Lyndon Johnson delayed advocating a voting rights bill until Mr. Wallace 's minions prevented blacks from starting their Selma-to-Montgomery protest march in 1965 .
But from the first , Mr. Wallace viewed the office of governor as little more than a platform from which to denounce what he believed were unwarranted federal encroachments in business , unions , schools , churches and even private homes .
He tapped into deep pools of public distrust of growing federal power , and he gave voice to widespread uneasiness about civil disorder , which few in authority appeared willing to confront for fear of seeming illiberal .
At the same time , his populist rhetoric strengthened the sense of political self-worth among shopkeepers , blue-collar workers , secretaries , taxi drivers -- all those who felt oppressed or ignored by powerful institutions such as big government and the national media .
Mr. Wallace articulated the prevalent alarm over the concentration of too much wealth in too few hands , too much dependence on foreign capital and foreign sources of energy , too many `` giveaways '' to foreign governments while too many Americans `` live under bridges -LCB- or -RCB- lie on grates in the winter to keep warm '' -- themes echoed by nascent political movements led by Patrick Buchanan and Ross Perot .
One need not accept any of Mr. Wallace 's views to agree that they appealed , by and large , to the real concerns of real people , not to mindless , unreasoning fears , racial or otherwise .
And though many of those concerns once had been arrogantly or ignorantly dismissed as mere racial `` code words , '' every president from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton based his successful campaign on some key elements of George Wallace 's political agenda .
It is this , rather than the attempted obstruction of integration , that is Mr. Wallace 's legacy .
Eventually , Mr. Wallace recognized that his defense of segregation was badly misguided , and he backed away from it as dramatically as he had earlier advocated it .
In the twilight of his career , he went to Alabama 's blacks and , by extension , the blacks of America , to ask their forgiveness .
There were three reasons -- two self-serving , but one an epiphany .
First , he needed and wanted black votes in his last run for governor in 1982 -- and he sought them with all the brass of which politicians are capable .
Second , as he approached what he assumed was the end of his life -LRB- he has predicted his death annually for the last 10 years -RRB- , he hoped to prevent his past racism from obscuring his messages of social conservatism and economic populism .
But his third reason revealed a humanity so often lacking in his actions : Alone and crippled by a gunman 's bullet since 1972 , forced to introspection for the first time in his life , he realized that though he had purported to be the champion of the poor and the helpless , he had trampled on the poorest and most helpless of all his constituents -- the blacks .
Late in 1978 , shortly before he was to leave office for what he thought was the last time , and nearly three years before he decided to seek the governorship again , he appeared unannounced at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery , the church whose pulpit Martin Luther King Jr. occupied when he kindled the modern civil-rights movement .
The singular symbolism of the moment must have pulsed through the sanctuary .
Three hundred black ministers and lay leaders of Alabama churches were concluding a day-long conference when Mr. Wallace was wheeled to the foot of the pulpit .
He told the hushed gathering , `` I never had hate in my heart for any person .
But I regret my support of segregation and the pain it caused the black people of our state and nation .
'' Then , amid cries of `` amen '' and `` yes , Lord , '' Mr. Wallace added : `` I 've learned what pain is and I 'm sorry if I 've caused anybody else pain .
Segregation was wrong -- and I am sorry .
'' Many would ascribe Mr. Wallace 's conversion , as historian C. Vann Woodward did , to `` rather crass politics .
'' But had Mr. Wallace 's essential message not reached beyond race -- long before his `` conversion '' -- he could not have aroused the tens of millions who gave him their vote for president or who switched their allegiance away from him only after mainstream candidates adopted many of his positions .

Sweden 's financial markets have been volatile this week on changing prospects of economic proposals by the opposition Social Democratic Party .
The Socialists ' prescription for Sweden 's ills is that old chestnut `` austerity , '' mainly higher taxes .
There 's some lip service to spending cuts , but in order to swallow that you have to accept the party 's claim that it will get `` lower interest rates .
'' We ca n't begin to count how many budget projections we 've seen that promised lower interest costs to the government .
What party leader Ingvar Carlsson and his cohorts have come up with is not new socialism , but old socialism , very much like the brand that caused voters to throw them out of office in 1991 .
They ` ve been hoping voters would have dreamy visions of a return to the old days , when socialism piggybacked on the country 's once vigorous private industrial sector .
That the Socialists ' prospects are good for returning to power in September 's elections only demonstrates how difficult it is to repair Sweden 's economic and social damage , even for a bright guy like incumbent Prime Minister Carl Bildt .
Despite having to struggle against the Social Democrats with an unwieldy coalition , he has made progress .
But now , so opinion polls suggest , Swedish voters in their impatience are tilting back toward the Socialists .
At least it can be said for Mr. Carlsson that he did n't engage in the kind of fakery the German Socialists have just employed .
The German SPD has nothing more to offer than a tax boost as well .
But it is trying to disguise it as a `` soak-the-rich '' increase when in fact its main impact will be on the middle class -- because that 's where the most revenues are to be found .
Mr. Carlsson wants to soak the rich too , if he can find any well-to-do Swede who did n't hide his wealth in Luxembourg years ago .
But the main burden will be carried by all Swedes , through a boost in national health insurance taxes .
No economy has ever been revived with tax-boost `` austerity .
'' Britain 's Socialists used that line for years before finally being awarded a long-term vacation in 1979 .
Margaret Thatcher knew that the only cure for Britain would be to unload as much Socialist baggage as possible , mainly the state industries , and go for growth .
Britain today , by comparison with 1979 , is a prosperous country , with good prospects for further advances .
Mr. Bildt understood the Thatcher lesson quite well when he took over the wreckage in 1991 .
But because most of Sweden 's excess baggage consists of social welfare programs , he has had a more difficult job than Mrs. Thatcher in reducing the burden .
Privatization of industry has many fans , but it takes a truly brave politician to withdraw what the voters regard as `` entitlements .
'' Nonetheless , he has made some progress .
After a long recession , the Swedish economy is once again growing .
Given a bit more of the Bildt medicine and the continued employment by Swedish industry of its considerable skills , it is not hard to imagine Sweden pulling out of its slump .
The Social Democrats were reluctant to reveal their economic plan .
Mr. Carlsson certainly has had no wish to debate Mr. Bildt .
Now we see that they are simply planning to raise taxes , in a country where public spending already accounts for 70 % of gross national product .
They created the failed welfare state , and now their goal is merely to try to sustain it a while longer .
I overheard some high-school students talking about summer employment .
One said : `` For college I gotta get a summer job .
But it ai n't gonna be no factory job .
What could I learn from a factory job ?
'' In addition to correcting his grammar , I 'd like to tell him about a few lessons I learned from a factory job I held the summer before my senior year in high school , many years ago .
It was a job in a paint factory in Grand Rapids , Mich. .
On my first day , one of the owner 's sons greeted me warmly and pointed to some huge overhead vats held up by giant chains and hooks .
The plant manager said : `` Connon , those are sky hooks and I need another pair .
Would you go into the next department and get some ?
'' Off I went .
But there were no sky hooks there .
I was sent to the mixing area instead .
No sky hooks there either .
I wound up visiting every department in the factory .
By the time I was finished , it was early morning break time .
In the employee break area I was informed with much laughter that there was no such thing as a sky hook .
The factory used the sky-hook routine to get to know a new hire .
That factory job , as perhaps most jobs do , demanded that one quickly master social skills .
Learning how to accept good-natured hazing was , for me , the first lesson .
Before working inside the paint factory , a new hire had to scrape and paint the outside of the building .
Having taken the scrapers and the ladders into the hot sun , I returned home with tired hands .
I learned that perhaps a man 's best friends are his 10 fingers .
Many factory workers `` throw down '' with their bodies every day -LRB- work their bodies hard -RRB- .
You learn to respect the honest factory worker , man or woman .
When I started painting , I was told that the owners wanted the factory painted every summer because the brick exterior was so porous .
I remember being hesitant to apply the brush and rollers because of my inexperience .
The family that owned the business knew that .
The day I finished my first side , all the nearby workers came outside for a short break to applaud my efforts .
The memory of that day is still with me .
I learned that the fruit derived from honest labor is one of the sweetest of all pleasures .
On special days when the train boxcars came to the docks , a team of six workers was picked to unload 50-pound sacks of paint ingredients .
We started at 7 a.m. Whenever we finished our task , the workday was considered done and we could go home early .
If everyone worked together , the afternoon was free time .
It was a great management tool .
I learned that it is possible to make a difficult task into a positive experience ... an exercise in teamwork .
I could go on listing the many skills and values I began to assimilate that summer .
But just to mention one more : I remember objecting to having an election bumper sticker placed on my car .
The owners listened and stated they were willing to scrape it off .
Respect for labor , even part-time labor , is possible from good and fair management .
The factory I worked at was called The Ford Paint and Varnish Company -- and I am forever thankful for my summer factory job working for President Gerald Ford 's father and brothers .
I 'd like to tell the lad avoiding a factory job to read this quote from Jeremy Taylor , the 17th-century English bishop : `` If it were not for labor , men could neither eat so much , nor relish so pleasantly , nor sleep so soundly , nor be so healthful , so useful , so strong , so patient , so noble , nor so untempted .

NEW YORK -- It 's smarter to shell out big bucks now than dig in for a prolonged court fight with investors angry over soured investments .
That 's the conclusion of brokerage firms , banks and mutual-fund companies in the wake of recent derivatives losses in money-market and bond funds , along with stumbles by other fund investments .
Since May , Wall Street financial firms have paid out a total of about $ 425 million to shore up battered funds and stave off investor lawsuits .
The payments have ranged from outright cash outlays for aggrieved bond-fund investors to cash injections into several money-market funds to purchases of derivatives products that had led to losses .
Statistics are scarce on such `` guilt money , '' but one thing is clear : Brokerage firms are ponying up more cash more quickly than ever when faced with protests over questionable investments , securities lawyers say .
`` The view is to try to get this stuff nipped in the bud , '' says John L. Steffens , head of Merrill Lynch & Co. 's brokerage operations .
`` People have learned the lesson .
If they have a problem , they are clearly going to deal with it more upfront .
'' Brokerage firms figure they ultimately will end up making some payment in many investor cases .
So from a legal , tactical and public-relations view , it 's often better to pay up immediately .
While Wall Street 's evolving policy might prompt a flurry of claims from investors wanting to be made whole , investors should n't expect to milk firms dry .
Most investments , after all , carry some degree of risk , and Wall Street wo n't pick up the tab for losses in the ordinary course of business .
`` We and other firms have to be prepared to fight when we think we 're right , '' says Theodore Levine , PaineWebber Group Inc. 's general counsel .
The payments come as Wall Street firms and their clients grapple with the downside of derivatives -- financial arrangements whose value is linked to , or derived from , the performance of some underlying asset , such as bonds , currencies or commodities .
Many derivatives products have plunged in value with the steep rises in interest rates this year , pummeling funds that held them .
The problem for many funds : They had been aggressively using derivatives to jack up returns amid declining interest rates in recent years .
Behind the fast payout trend is the disastrous experience of Prudential Securities Inc. .
The Prudential Insurance Co. of America unit decided several years back to aggressively fight hundreds of lawsuits and arbitrations over soured limited partnerships .
But the strategy backfired : Prudential has ended up forking over more than $ 1 billion so far to investors , and the payments show no signs of slowing .
Prudential 's experience `` may have made it easier for a general counsel to sell settling to management and get on with it , '' says Sam Scott Miller , a New York lawyer and former PaineWebber general counsel .
`` Why spend several years squabbling with the other side 's lawyers , when you 're unlikely to do a lot better , '' he says .
`` In fact , you may cut your losses '' by quickly paying up .
The securities arbitration process has furthered the trend .
It 's a gamble for brokerage firms to fight arbitration claims by investors because , unlike court decisions , defendants have little chance of appealing big damage awards .
And making quick payments to investors can defuse the claims of plaintiff lawyers .
`` If you 're completely made whole , with interest , it 's tough to say that firms did n't act honorably , '' says Theodore Krebsbach , a New York lawyer and former litigation chief at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. .
Recent cases have varied widely .
PaineWebber 's action has received the most attention : The country 's fifth-largest brokerage firm , in an unprecedented move , decided in June to repay investors $ 33 million for losses resulting from risky mortgage-derivative securities held by its Short-Term U.S. Government Income Fund .
PaineWebber also has said it will buy back an additional $ 235 million of derivatives positions , for a total hit to the firm of $ 268 million .
It was n't all altruism on PaineWebber 's part .
Through the payment , the firm expects to settle two investor suits on the matter .
And although the fund 's prospectus technically allows the portfolio to hold such esoteric securities , PaineWebber 's selling materials and investor presentations specifically said the fund did n't intend to hold them .
Indeed , some PaineWebber brokers sold the fund as an alternative to a super-safe certificate of deposit ; some internal selling materials referred to the fund as a `` CD buster , '' people familiar with the matter say .
-LRB- PaineWebber says these materials were n't approved by the firm .
-RRB- Many of the recent injections have involved money-market funds .
Derivatives losses threatened to reduce several money funds ' per-share value below $ 1 ; cash infusions saved them from `` breaking the buck .
'' Such an event could have shaken investors ' confidence in the funds , which , unlike CDs , do n't have deposit insurance .
`` If you did that broke the buck , you 're probably out of the money-fund business , '' says Merrill 's Mr. Steffens .
Some payments have stemmed from allegedly unauthorized trading in derivatives .
In July , CS First Boston Inc. repaid three institutional clients a total of $ 40 million after a CS First Boston Investment Management portfolio manager allegedly made unauthorized derivatives trades in their private portfolios .
The portfolio manager denies he did anything wrong .
The CS Holding AG unit declined to identify the clients ; one was a European bank .
Not all the payouts have stemmed from sour derivatives trades .
Just this week , Merrill agreed to pay investors as much as $ 30 million in several failed rare-coin and ancient-art limited-partnerships funds , settling several investor lawsuits .

The answer is : The Nazis were looting throughout occupied Europe for all kinds of metals which they needed for their war effort .
They took bells out of church towers and monuments off their pedestals in order to melt them down .
TOKYO -- Honda Motor Co. reported a sharp upturn in operating profit for its fiscal first quarter , as results were spurred by robust North American sales .
Nevertheless , the troubles of Honda and its fellow Japanese auto makers are far from over , as they face the burdens of an anemic domestic market , excess capacity and the strong yen .
Honda said its consolidated net income for the quarter ended June 30 nearly quadrupled to 23.14 billion yen -LRB- $ 236 million -RRB- from 6.09 billion yen , although much of the increase stemmed from a special gain from the termination of Honda 's cross-shareholding with Rover Group Ltd. .
Operating profit rose 16 % to 25.8 billion yen , mainly because of cost-cutting efforts , as well as an increase in revenue and higher-end vehicle sales .
While the popularity of Honda 's redesigned Accord and Integra models helped boost North American sales 20 % , sales in Japan fell 13 % .
North American sales now represent 49 % of Honda 's revenue , up from 44.5 % a year earlier .
About 40 % of Honda 's cars sold in the U.S. and Canada are produced in Japan .
The company , which raised prices about 1 % in the U.S. in May , said more price increases may be necessary to offset the impact of the high yen on Japanese exports .
`` In the long run ... we 're trying to shift production overseas to be free from such external factors as the exchange rate , '' said Shigeki Hayashi , a Honda senior finance manager .
The company recently said it will boost U.S. production .
Meantime , the Japanese auto industry remains plagued by overcapacity .
Factory utilization is at its lowest level in 20 years .
Nissan Motor Co. said this week that July domestic production fell 18 % , while world-wide production was down 12 % .
Its domestic sales fell 6.4 % in July .
Toyota Motor Corp. , too , said its domestic production fell 3.3 % for July , though overseas production rose 18 % , thanks to vibrant truck and bus sales .
Toyota today will report earnings for the fiscal year that ended June 30 ; analysts expect operating income to be in line with forecasts of about 200 billion yen .
Meanwhile , Japanese auto makers are relying more and more on leasing to maintain or increase share in the U.S. , and that can be risky .
Leasing involves betting on the future values of cars , and can get dicey if the used-car market turns down .
According to Automotive News , in the first half of this calendar year Toyota increased leasing to 24 % of its U.S. sales from 13 % a year earlier .
Nissan 's leasing rose to 23 % from 15 % ; Honda 's to 22 % from 17 % ; and Mazda 's to 22 % from 12 % .
Honda , however , puts its leasing in the U.S. at about 20 % , up from 17 % .
Mr. Hayashi said the company has no intention of boosting it further because of its `` great risk .
'' `` They are only postponing losses , '' said Keith Donaldson , an analyst at Salomon Brothers , referring to the increased lease business .
`` In 1997 , it may come back to haunt them .
'' WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp. asked a federal court here to enforce subpoenas seeking documents and financial data from two key figures who were involved with a failed Arkansas thrift at the center of the Whitewater affair .
The RTC asked the U.S. district court to compel James McDougal , who owned Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan in Little Rock , Ark. , and Jim Guy Tucker , who is currently governor of Arkansas , to provide the thrift-cleanup agency with documents , financial information and testimony related to the Madison failure .
During the 1980s , Mr. McDougal was a partner with then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton in the Whitewater real-estate development .
The RTC and an independent counsel are investigating whether Madison funds were illegally diverted to Whitewater or to Mr. Clinton 's Arkansas gubernatorial campaign .
Mr. Tucker was previously lieutenant governor of Arkansas , and he was deeply involved with some of Mr. McDougal 's Madison-related ventures .
The RTC action indicates that Mr. Tucker and Mr. McDougal are potential defendants in any civil action the RTC might take , depending partly on what the subpoenaed data would show .
Both men have refused to testify in the RTC 's civil probe of the Madison matter , or to produce any of the subpoenaed information , the agency said .
`` We want documents and testimony that we feel would have some usefulness to us as part of our civil investigation into the failure of Madison Guaranty , '' RTC spokesman Stephen Katsanos said .
The RTC said the documents it seeks include material concerning some Madison Guaranty affiliates , such as Madison Financial Corp. and Campobello Development Co. .
They involve Madison loans , according to John Haley , the governor 's lawyer .
He said Mr. Tucker `` declined '' to turn over the documents because he already has given the originals to the independent counsel .
`` We 're just saying , ` Enough is enough , ' '' Mr. Haley said .
`` If the RTC wants something , they can get it from the documents that are already in the possession of the independent counsel .
'' But , he added , Mr. Tucker would turn over copies if the court orders him to do so .
Mr. McDougal and his attorney could n't be reached for comment .
Mr. Tucker borrowed money from Madison to help finance real-estate developments in which Mr. McDougal also was involved -- including a mobile-home park near Little Rock that led to some of the thrift 's biggest losses .
He also was a stockholder in Madison , and his law firm represented the institution .
The RTC 's civil investigation of Madison , along with similar probes into hundreds of other failed savings-and-loan institutions , was kept alive and given new vigor when Congress early this year extended the statute of limitations through 1995 for suing people involved in the failure of many thrifts .
The statute otherwise would have run out Feb. 28 .
The RTC said at the time that it had essentially completed its investigation of the S&Ls , but would follow Congress ' bidding and conduct another round of probes .
Meanwhile , Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle -LRB- D. , Mich. -RRB- and the committee 's ranking Republican , Alfonse D'Amato of New York , asked the acting head of the RTC to provide the committee with a `` detailed explanation '' of why three of the agency 's Kansas City , Mo. , employees recently were placed on administrative leave .
The three , including investigator Jean Lewis , were involved in generating 10 criminal referrals on Madison last year and in 1992 .
Sens. Riegle and D'Amato sought a response by Sept. 6 , and asked whether the regional employees were suspended in connection with their work on the Madison investigation .
The letter also asked whether any RTC officials discussed the move with White House or Treasury officials .

WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department 's antitrust division has given a green light to a proposed study of compensation methods for securities brokers .
The study , which will be done by a private-sector committee , was ordered by Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt to examine how to reduce conflicts of interest among brokers -- such as those that occur when a broker advises a client to purchase products on which the broker receives a commission even if those investments are n't in the client 's best interests .
The committee consists of the chairmen of Merrill Lynch & Co. .
Inc. , Legg Mason Inc. , Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and General Electric Co. , plus an academician from Harvard Business School and an investor advocate .
The committee asked the Justice Department to clear the panel 's activities under antitrust law .
Lawyers for the committee said it wo n't discuss the appropriate level of compensation for brokers .
The committee `` does not appear to raise risks to competition or constitute an illegal agreement under the antitrust laws , '' said a letter from antitrust chief Anne Bingaman .
DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. today will be forced to idle three assembly plants employing 9,900 workers because of a strike at its tail-light plant in Anderson , Ind. .
If the strike continues , it could quickly shut down most of GM 's North American production .
Anderson supplies taillights , signal lights and other parts to the majority of GM 's assembly plants .
The three assembly plants to be idled are GM 's big car factory in Flint , Mich. , its truck plant in Fort Wayne , Ind. , and its midsize car factory in Oshawa , Ontario .
The plants build some of GM 's hottest products , including its fullsize pickup trucks .
The strike in Anderson , which began Tuesday , was provoked by GM 's efforts to move work currently done by UAW workers in Anderson to lower-wage shops , according to union officials .
Anderson employs 3,320 UAW-represented workers .
The Anderson work stoppage is the latest UAW backlash to GM 's campaign to improve its productivity and slash its costs .
Earlier this year , the union sanctioned brief strikes at GM 's assembly plant in Shreveport , La. , its brake plant in Dayton , Ohio , and its technical center in Warren , Mich. .
The strike comes at a particularly sensitive time for GM , which is struggling to produce enough cars and trucks to meet the market 's strong demand .
Indeed , the company recently shut several plants for retooling and , in July , closed its entire operation-including manufacturing-for a corporatewide , two-week vacation .
`` It 's not a good time for a strike .
We 're in the midst of a strong recovery , '' said Christopher Cedergren , a consultant with AutoPacific Group of Santa Ana , Calif. .
GM 's announcement came after the close of trading yesterday .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , GM closed at $ 50.875 , up $ 2.25 .
HARLEYVILLE , S.C. -- Giant Group Ltd. said it agreed to buy 2.5 million shares of Rally 's Hamburgers Inc. , a Louisville , Ky. , fast-food concern , increasing its stake to 46.9 % from 38 % .
Rally 's rose 31.25 cents to $ 4.19 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading , giving the transaction a value of $ 10.8 million .
Rally 's also agreed to issue warrants to an unaffiliated party to buy 100,000 shares at $ 4 each .
Meanwhile , Moody 's Investors Service downgraded Rally 's $ 85 million senior notes due 2000 to single-B2 from single-B1 and said it is keeping the rating under review for another possible downgrade .
Interco Inc. said it will spin off its Florsheim shoe unit and make an initial public offering for 16 % of its Converse athletic-shoe holdings .
The plan is designed to allow Interco officials to maximize the company 's value by separating a collection of diverse businesses and creating two additional publicly traded entities .
Analysts said Interco 's hodgepodge of footwear and furniture businesses has held down the parent company 's stock price .
Two weeks ago , officials of St. Louis-based Interco said they were considering selling or spinning off part or all of their footwear businesses .
The company 's two furniture divisions , Broyhill and Lane , are better performers .
Interco stock closed yesterday at $ 14.75 , up 37.5 cents , in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
The plan calls for Interco to spin off Florsheim Shoe Co. , its weakest unit , though profitable , in what the company expects to be a tax-free transaction .
In connection with the spinoff , Florsheim will issue $ 100 million in senior notes in a public offering .
Interco also said Florsheim has obtained a commitment from Bankers Trust Co. for a $ 75 million revolving-credit facility .
Florsheim , which sells men 's shoes through a network of 355 company-owned stores and 6,000 department and specialty stores , has failed to deliver substantial earnings growth .
Last year , Florsheim had operating earnings of $ 29.9 million on sales of $ 300 million .
For the first half of 1994 , the unit reported a 27 % decline in operating earnings to $ 8.8 million , from $ 12.1 million , on flat sales of $ 146 million .
The Florsheim spinoff could prompt a restructuring of that group , said Budd Bugatch , an industry analyst with Raymond James & Associates , St. Petersburg , Fla. .
Interco 's plans also call for it to conduct a public offering for 16 % of Converse Inc. , which has prospered in recent months on the success of its canvas , high-top athletic shoes .
Interco said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer 3.2 million Converse common shares , although the timing of the offer wo n't be known for several weeks .
Smith Barney Inc. is the lead underwriter .
Converse also has obtained a $ 150 million revolving-credit facility from Bankers Trust .
Converse had 1993 operating profit of $ 28.8 million on sales of $ 380 million .
For the first half of this year , Converse 's operating profit jumped 46 % , to $ 24.4 million , while its sales grew 19 % to $ 227 million .
Converse will use the proceeds from the offering to pay off debt , Interco said .
After the spinoff and divestiture , Interco said it will have long-term debt of $ 435 million , down from $ 579 million at the end of June .
Interco officials declined to say what impact the divestiture and spinoff will have on management at the parent and its subsidiaries , which have operated largely autonomously .
Yesterday 's announcement marked another milestone in the resurgence Interco has planned since emerging from bankruptcy protection two years ago .
Interco was driven into Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection in 1991 after taking on debt to defend itself against a takeover attempt .
NEWTON , Mass. -- Harcourt General Inc. , citing a restructuring charge and lower publishing sales , said net income fell 16 % on 8 % lower revenue for the fiscal third quarter ended July 31 .
In the quarter , net income was $ 89.2 million , or $ 1.12 a share , down from $ 106.8 million , or $ 1.34 a share , a year earlier .
Revenue from continuing operations slipped to $ 815.1 million from $ 885.8 million .
Earnings from continuing operations fell 51 % to $ 45.5 million , or 57 cents a share , including an after-tax restructuring charge of $ 28.1 million for restructuring and store closings at Neiman Marcus Group 's Contempo Casuals division and the shutdown of Neiman 's Pastille retail-store business .
Neiman is a 65 % - owned unit .
In the year-earlier quarter , Harcourt 's earnings from continuing operations were $ 93.4 million , or $ 1.17 a share .
Harcourt said its insurance business , which it earlier agreed to sell to GE Capital Corp. , is treated as a discontinued operation in the results for its latest and year-earlier quarters .
In the latest quarter , earnings from the discontinued operations were $ 43.7 million , or 55 cents a share , including $ 35 million of income-tax benefits , or 44 cents a share , from the settlement of tax matters related mainly to the company 's soft-drink bottling business , which was sold in 1989 .
Year-earlier earnings from discontinued operations were $ 13.4 million , or 17 cents a share , including a $ 1.9 million charge for `` spinoff transaction expenses , '' the company said .
The publishing and specialty-retailing concern said its lower latest-quarter earnings reflected `` reduced selling opportunities for elementary and secondary textbooks compared to an unusually strong 1993 quarter .
'' It said they also reflected `` slightly lower specialty-retailing earnings '' and lower earnings from its professional-services business .
Harcourt said its lower publishing earnings resulted from a shift of some elementary and secondary textbook revenues to the fourth quarter from the third quarter because of `` later-than-anticipated ordering from schools .
'' That , however , will boost fourth-quarter revenue .
The company still expects `` modestly higher publishing earnings '' for the year .
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading , Harcourt was unchanged at $ 32.375 a share .
`` I 'm not going to tell you that you 're going to die by the time you 're 55 if you do n't exercise and work out , '' says a trim , young man on television , `` because if that were true , what the heck is Dom DeLuise still doing alive , huh ?
'' But the man is extolling the virtues of health and fitness -- and no wonder .
Clad in spandex and running shoes , he is an actor appearing on a Reebok International broadcast that will air on closed-circuit TV in thousands of schools starting next month .
The program , called P.E. TV , will have no ads .
But it will flash Reebok 's name before captive classroom audiences totaling millions of teens -- a variation on `` product placement , '' in which companies pay to have their wares turn up in movies and TV sitcoms .
Analysts call it a relatively cheap way for Reebok to score brand-recognition points against archrival Nike .
A presentation of Whittle Communications , the 12-minute weekly broadcasts will be shown to junior high and high school students as part of a two-semester physical-education program .
P.E. TTV already is intensifying controversy about classroom broadcasts .
Whittle , best known for its Channel One , an advertiser-supported news program broadcast in classrooms , is under fire from activists who want to ban all forms of advertising in the classroom .
Though P.E. TTV wo n't air commercials , Reebok is its sole underwriter .
That means the Stoughton , Mass. , athletic-footwear maker gets to show its name , logos , products and a bevy of Reebok-wearing celebrities during MTV-style video lessons -- all for an estimated cost of about $ 2 million .
`` This is not altruism , '' says Reebok spokesman Dave Fogelson .
`` From a marketing standpoint it makes perfect sense .
'' Indeed , analysts estimate that it would cost Reebok tens of millions of dollars for TV commercials to reach the same audience over a nine-month period .
P.E. TV , they add , will enable Reebok to break out of the commercial-TV advertising clutter into a nontraditional , albeit untested , promotional venue .
Reebok calls its P.E. TTV segments `` programmercials , '' says David Ropes , the company 's vice president of global marketing .
`` You 're not selling kids anything , '' he explains , `` but the company 's hope is that through year-round exposure we 're building a loyalty relationship with the students .
'' Even subtle advertising , however , is too much for many parents and educators .
`` If physical education is brought to you by Reebok , what 's to come next ?
Environmental science by Exxon and math by DuPont ?
'' asks Robin Templeton , campaign coordinator for Unplug , an antiChannel One group based in Berkeley , Calif. .
Ms. Templeton calls the venture `` the auctioning of lesson plans to corporate America .
'' As part of a campaign predating P.E. TV , the National Education Association has called for state and local affiliates to lobby their state retirement plans to divest from corporations that advertise on Channel One .
Reebok , which does advertise on Channel One , is on the list .
Teacher retirement programs in New York , California , Ohio and Kentucky own a combined total of more than 1.3 million Reebok shares , or 1.5 % of Reebok 's 84.4 million outstanding shares .
But Matthew Guidry , deputy executive director for the President 's Council on Fitness and Sports , praises Reebok and other companies that `` step up to the plate '' as school funds for physical education dwindle in the wake of federal and state cutbacks .
Besides , he adds , P.E. TTV is overseen by an academically respectable advisory board .
Its nine-member panel includes college professors , physical-education instructors and other experts , including the head athletic trainer of the Dallas Cowboys and Dave Johnson , a 1992 U.S. Olympic decathlete -- who is familiar to teens from appearances in Reebok 's `` Dan and Dave '' commercials .
As part of a P.E. TTV package , teachers will receive an instructor 's manual , courtesy of Reebok , with a 32-week lesson plan .
Interspersed with health and diet tips is a collection of color photographs of Reebok-endorsing athletes , including tennis pro Michael Chang , Olympic skater Nancy Kerrigan and track star Sandra Farmer Patrick .
They are shown performing under a Planet Reebok logo .
A six-minute promotional piece for educators indicates how Reebok hopes to use TV to inspire teens to renounce their couch-potato ways : It features scenes at the beach in which a nine-time freestyle-Frisbee world champion performs somersaults on the sand while spinning a Frisbee on his hand .
All-pro wide receiver Willie Gault offers tips on how to catch a football .
And California Angels pitcher Joe MacGrane tells how to keep cool under pressure .
`` The first thing you do , '' he advises , `` is to maintain composure .
'' Reebok officials say that by linking the company 's name with such stars , the company hopes to win a reputation as a `` performance '' brand .
`` Let 's face it , we 're in a catch-up position to Nike in this field , '' Mr. Ropes says .
Reebok is banking on a huge viewing audience -- Whittle claims about 95 % of the 12,000 schools receiving Channel One have agreed to air P.E. TTV this fall .
An additional 3,000 schools , which are n't hooked up with Whittle 's satellite system , have requested videotapes of the broadcast , Whittle adds .
But the estimate may be high .
Only one of two dozen Channel One-receiving schools recently contacted by The Wall Street Journal had heard of P.E. TV .
The one -- Bowie High School in Bowie , Texas -- did n't want the program .
`` We just do n't have any time in a regular school day to teach the things we 're supposed to be teaching , '' says John Hodge , Bowie 's principal .
`` Heck , we 're already losing 15 minutes to Channel One .
'' Others say they want information on the program -- if it 's free .
`` We ` re willing to try anything , other than basketball-dunking contests , to motivate our students , '' said Manny Aguire , principal of Jefferson High School in El Paso , Texas .
`` P.E. is a dead field .
Unfortunately , the general attitude these days , '' he says , `` is just go out and do some calisthenics .
'' MONTERREY , Mexico -- When Dionisio Garza Medina took over as chairman of Grupo Alfa in March , he had two big problems .
He needed to streamline the gangly Mexican conglomerate , and figure out how to deal with a billionaire who is accumulating Alfa shares .
In the past two years , Carlos Slim Helu 's brokerage unit , Grupo Financiero Inbursa , has quietly purchased about 15 % of Alfa 's stock for about 20 pesos a share on average .
With Alfa stock now at 37.70 pesos , that investment is valued at about $ 140 million more than he paid for it , proving again the Slim team 's skill at bottom-fishing .
But what Mr. Slim and Inbursa do next is important to Mr. Garza .
Hostile takeovers are rare in Mexico 's clubby business culture , and the Garza family controls enough stock to impede any attempt .
But Mr. Slim is saying little and Alfa is ripe for further restructuring , so the Inbursa stake worries the Garza family .
Why is Mr. Slim buying the stock ?
`` I have talked to him many times , and he said Alfa has a great future , '' Mr. Garza says .
`` I have asked him when he is going to sell .
He said , ` When the time is right .
' '' Mr. Garza says he even offered Mr. Slim a seat on the board , which he refused .
Fernando Chico , who heads Inbursa , says the Alfa investment `` is absolutely passive and investment-related .
'' He says the Alfa shares are n't even concentrated at Grupo Carso , the publicly traded holding company for the Slim interests .
Instead , the stock is spread throughout Inbursa 's mutual funds , Carso employee pension funds and the portfolio of Mr. Slim 's insurance company , Seguros de Mexico .
`` We made the evaluation , we thought it was cheap , '' Mr. Chico says .
`` We feel that there is still value .
The stock trades at 1.1 times book value when other companies like it trade at two times book ... There are better times for Alfa in the future .
'' If the stock goes down , Mr. Chico says , Inbursa will consider buying more .
So far , Inbursa seems confident that 40-year-old `` Nicho '' Garza , as his friends call him , can break Alfa 's reputation as `` the laggard of Monterrey .
'' In the early 1980s , Alfa swerved toward bankruptcy as peso devaluations made its dollar debts difficult to repay .
After a lengthy financial and corporate restructuring , Alfa recorded one of its most profitable years ever in 1988 .
But with 77 % of sales in petrochemicals and steel , the economic slowdown in the early 1990s cut Alfa 's profit again .
Last year , the company posted $ 2.5 billion in revenue , but operating profit fell 24 % to $ 130 million .
The stock has underperformed the Mexican stock market for the past three years .
But since November , when it became clear that Mr. Garza would take over the chairmanship , the stock has climbed 99.5 % in local currency terms , compared with a 39.9 % gain in the Mexican stock index .
Mr. Garza , who has a reputation for frugality , is said to have little tolerance for corporate frills , and has fired half of Alfa 's middle-management in the past three months .
Top managers will simply have to work harder , he says .
Mr. Garza has focused on restoring higher profitability to his three main business sectors : steel , food and petrochemicals .
He is trying to make these business units less dependent on the giant conglomerate .
By December , he wants separate stock listings on the Mexican Bolsa for Hylsamex , Alfa 's steel unit , and Sigma , the food unit , and so-called 144a offerings in the U.S. Only large investors can buy and sell stocks listed under rule 144a in the U.S. Another benefit is that , if the subsidiaries are valued highly by the market , then the value of the holding company will rise .
`` We have to give more transparency to the value of the holding company , '' Mr. Garza says .
`` I think we can do that by listing the subsidiaries .
'' Certainly , Alfa 's food unit could sell at a high multiple to earnings .
Sigma 's net income more than doubled last year , and new food agreements should support additional growth .
Currently , Sigma distributes Oscar Mayer and its own brand of packaged meat and food products .
Mr. Garza , who headed Sigma before becoming chairman of Alfa , recently sealed an agreement with Sodima International of France to make and distribute Yoplait yogurt in Mexico .
The company also plans to make frozen Mexican food for the domestic and U.S. markets .
Meanwhile , Sigma 's distribution network includes 50 refrigerated warehouses around Mexico and a fleet of 570 delivery trucks , in a country where poor roads , lack of refrigeration and other problems make distribution an enormous problem .
The network could be valuable to other food companies seeking to enter the market .
Hylsamex could be a tougher sale .
Net income fell 55 % last year ; competition from U.S. and Mexican steelmakers is tough .
Mr. Garza says Hylsamex 's real attraction is its new low-cost , high-production minimill , though competitors are moving in the same direction .
One sign of Alfa 's revival is the expansion in operating profit margins to 8 % for this year 's first six months , compared with 5.5 % a year earlier .
`` Alfa is beginning to receive the benefit of the investments they have been making over the last two years , '' says Steven Walder , analyst at Mexican broker Probursa .
`` They are making a lot more money now than they have in a long time .
'' Beyond the initial moves , Mr. Garza says the challenge is to trim Alfa of nonstrategic businesses -- the company also has interests in mattresses and rugs , for example -- and to invest in less cyclical businesses .
He is talking to several international telecommunications companies to form a phone company that will compete against Mr. Slim 's Telefonos de Mexico in 1997 .
And he is looking at ventures in electrical power cogeneration .
`` If you look at the profile of our strategy , we are going from a commodity company into more value-added products , '' with their higher-profit margins , Mr. Garza says .
Alfa will tiptoe into retailing , opening 25 home-improvement stores in Mexico over the next five years .
To move out of commodity steels , Mr. Garza is setting up a fabrication shop for molded steel in a joint venture with Worthington Industries Inc. of Columbus , Ohio .
`` Though the company is a melange , we have a good growth story to tell , '' Mr. Garza says .
Like any other shareholder , he 's betting on it .
Alfa is in the Mexican market buying up its own stock under Mr. Garza 's orders .
`` This guy Slim is buying a lot , so I should be too , ' '' Mr. Garza says .
The crime and health care debates notwithstanding , some in Congress are anxious to deflate gasbags .
Reps. Richard Lehman -LRB- D. , California -RRB- and Barbara Vucanovich -LRB- R. , Nevada -RRB- are sponsoring legislation to eliminate the government 's stockpile of helium .
Since 1960 , the Bureau of Mines has been stocking the stuff near Amarillo , Texas , running up a $ 1.3 billion debt while preparing for a shortage that never materialized .
Today , helium is plentiful and supplied by the private sector .
Selling off the helium reserve was recommended by Vice President Al Gore 's reinventing government report .
Still , it may be a tough sell to convince Washington that there 's anything wrong with more hot air .
BEDFORD , Mass. -- Millipore Corp. said it plans to buy back as many as 3.5 million , or about 12 % , of its common shares outstanding in a `` Dutch auction '' self tender at between $ 52 and $ 60 a share .
The purification technology company said it plans to use part of the $ 300 million in net proceeds from the recent sale of its Waters Chromatography and Biosearch divisions to buy the shares .
Under terms of its offer , Millipore said it will invite shareholders to tender their shares at prices between $ 52 and $ 60 , as specified by the shareholder .
The company will determine a single per-share price within the range that will enable it to repurchase 3.5 million shares , or a lesser number of shares if fewer than that are tendered .
If more than 3.5 million shares are tendered at or below the purchase price , Millipore said it will pro-rate shares purchased from tendering holders .
The self tender will begin on Aug. 25 , and expire at midnight Sept. 22 , unless extended , the company said .
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. is dealer-manager for the offer .
Upon completion of the self tender , Millipore said it will use the balance of proceeds from the division sales to fund an open-market stock-repurchase program .
The company currently has 28.2 million shares outstanding .
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading , Millipore rose $ 1.875 , or 3.5 % , to $ 55 .
Last year 's crop disaster is taking its last gasps at the Chicago Board of Trade .
Grain prices rose yesterday because processors are scrounging around the Midwest for the remnants of the 1993 harvests , which were slashed by record floods and excessive rain .
The supply of corn and soybeans in the Midwest is expected to shrink to the lowest level in two decades before Midwest farmers begin harvesting what are expected to be bumper crops in September .
Grain analysts said Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc. , for example , is scrambling to find enough soybeans to satisfy its delivery obligations under futures contracts it sold at the Chicago Board of Trade .
Cargill declined to comment yesterday , but traders are speculating the company is trying to ship millions of bushels to Chicago this month .
The cash price of soybeans rose yesterday from Minneapolis to Indianapolis , which in turn helped fuel a futures rally .
In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade , the soybean contract for November delivery rose 6.75 cents a bushel to settle at $ 5.765 a bushel .
U.S. soybean prices also were lifted by reports that an early frost might strike major Canadian oilseed-producing regions this week , which would lower the potential harvest .
Meteorologists were divided over the chances for a damaging frost , however .
The frost speculation helped the market shrug off a surprisingly large harvest forecast from the Canadian government , which is based on conditions a few weeks ago .
Statistics Canada yesterday said it expects farmers to harvest a record 356 million bushels of canola this year , up 51 % from 235.9 million bushels last year .
Canola is Canada 's main oilseed crop .
The U.S. gets most of its vegetable oil from soybeans .
As expected , the Canadian government also projected the nation 's spring wheat crop will total 654.6 million bushels this year , down 25 % from last year for what would be the smallest wheat crop there since 1988 .
Weak prices earlier this spring , which is when the crop is planted , prompted farmers to plant fewer acres .
However , a U.S. shortage of good-quality durum , which is used to make pasta , prompted Canadian farmers to plant more acres .
The Canadian government said it expects durum farmers to harvest 164.8 million bushels this year , up 33 % from last year .
These crops were planted before Canada agreed to limit wheat shipments to the U.S. , where farmers blame swelling imports for depressing local grain prices .
A pact reached this month limits shipments to the U.S. by the Canadian Wheat Board , the government-backed export agency , to 55.1 million bushels for one year while a commission reviews the issue .
That is about half the amount Canada shipped to the U.S. in the year ended May 31 .
Canada 's barley crop , its biggest source of livestock rations , is expected to decline 6.6 % to 572.1 million bushels this year .
The country 's oat crop is expected to total 250.3 million bushels , up 6.8 % from last year .
Corn prices rose amid trade speculation that poor crop conditions in China might cut its corn exports by half .
In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade , the corn contract for September delivery rose 2.5 cents a bushel to settle at $ 2.235 a bushel .
Chinese officials and the U.S. Agriculture Department continue to predict China will export about 472 million bushels of corn , unchanged from the previous year .
China is a major competitor of the U.S. in the world corn market .
Reports also are circulating that Ukraine 's grain harvests might shrink this year to 35 million metric tons from the 45 million metric tons harvested last year .
That could force Russia , which is a major customer of Ukraine , to import wheat from other sources such as the United States .
ENERGY : Crude-oil prices rose on fresh problems for Nigerian oil exports amid the country 's civil strife .
In a dispute with the military government , oil workers have been on strike since July 4 and have reduced the country 's oil production .
Royal Dutch\/Shell Group notified customers that its Forcados oil-loading terminal in Nigeria was shut down because of sabotage over the weekend .
Because of an inability to fill up tankers , storage tanks at the terminal are full and production has been cut at the Forcados field , the company said .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , crude for October delivery rose 40 cents a barrel to $ 17.49 .
Meanwhile , gasoline prices fell .
Traders said a small drop in gasoline inventories reported for the latest week was disappointing .
COPPER : Copper prices surged in reaction to a report suggesting a pickup in demand .
In trading on the Comex division of the New York Merc , copper for September delivery jumped two cents to $ 1.0955 a pound .
William Byers , director of futures research at Bear , Sterns & Co. in New York , said the prices rose after release of the Comex 's daily report on warehouse stocks , which showed a drop of 619 tons to 32,871 tons .
`` That 's the lowest level in about two months , '' Mr. Byers said .
Copper has slumped recently amid a seasonal slowdown in demand after hitting a high of $ 1.1690 a pound July 19 .
`` We 've been in a very slow period for a month or so , but we 're starting to come out of it , '' said William O'Neill , chief futures strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York .
`` The market has held up extremely well around the $ 1.10 a pound level .
It 's only a matter of time before we push through that .
'' Analysts were encouraged by copper 's strength despite a sharp drop in durable-goods orders in July .
The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods fell 4.2 % , the biggest decline in more than two-and-a-half years .
`` The market is ignoring the softer economic news , '' said John Gross of J.E. Gross & Associates , a West Nyack , N.Y. , metals consulting concern .
`` There 's optimism that demand for copper in the fourth quarter will be steady at higher levels .
'' ATLANTA -- After nearly a year of searching , Turner Broadcasting System Inc. has landed a Hollywood executive to be president of production of its Turner Pictures Worldwide Inc. unit .
The entertainment company said Amy Pascal , 36 years old , will be in charge of making movies for the division , which is one of Turner 's three film production companies along with Castle Rock Entertainment and New Line Cinema .
Dennis Miller remains president of the administrative functions at Turner Pictures .
Ms. Pascal formerly was executive vice president of production for Columbia Pictures , a unit of Sony Corp. .
She was involved with such movies as `` Wolf , '' `` A League of Their Own '' and `` Groundhog Day .
'' Turner Pictures plans to make six to eight movies a year by 1998 , according to Scott Sassa , president of Turner Entertainment Group Inc. .
So far , its only theatrical release has been last year 's Civil War epic , `` Gettysburg .
'' Ms. Pascal indicated Turner Pictures might be a big spender in Hollywood .
`` We 're going to make big , star-driven movies , '' she said .
MINNEAPOLIS -- Derivative investments made by a single portfolio manager at Piper Jaffray Cos. could result in more than $ 700 million in losses to investors .
The losses , which occurred in funds managed by Worth Bruntjen , include the already-disclosed losses in what was the company 's $ 800 million Institutional Government Income Portfolio short-term bond fund as well as additional losses from other investment funds and a number of privately managed accounts .
The Institutional fund has fallen 23.3 % since the beginning of this year , according to Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. .
Edward J. Kohler , the president of Piper Capital Management , said the other fixed-income funds managed by Mr. Bruntjen have experienced losses of the same magnitude .
Since Mr. Bruntjen managed $ 3.5 billion in assets at the end of last year , that rate of decline suggests total losses of slightly more than $ 800 million .
In an interview , Mr. Kohler said Mr. Bruntjen 's investment accounts `` had the same kind of objectives , so they had the same kind of investments -- and the same kind of losses .
'' Robert Markman , president of Markman Capital Management , another Minneapolis-based money manager , asserts that `` this is one of the most incredible debacles in the financial-services industry .
'' Mr. Bruntjen 's portfolios affect every possible type of investor : municipalities and other public agencies , individuals , businesses and charities .
For Piper , a respected regional brokerage firm that celebrates its 100th anniversary next year and prides itself on the loyalty of its clients , the losses are tremendously damaging .
Mr. Bruntjen , the manager of the fund , was n't available for comment , but interviews with other Piper executives and industry analysts trace the losses directly to Mr. Bruntjen 's aggressive investments in derivatives .
Derivatives are financial agreements whose returns are linked to , or derived from , the performance of some underlying asset , such as bonds , currencies or commodities .
`` We got caught in a market that we thought we understood , '' said Addison L. Piper , the firm 's chairman and chief executive officer .
Mr. Bruntjen specialized in collateralized mortgage obligations , securities that are created out of bundles of residential mortgages as well as securities that were derived from them .
As much of 60 % of his investment portfolios were invested in derivatives .
In addition , he heightened the returns -- and the risks -- by using borrowed funds to purchase securities .
A Piper spokewoman said the value of the assets managed by Mr. Bruntjen had declined to $ 2.795 billion as of the end of June .
Although the drop from $ 3.5 billion could reflect , to some extent , investors withdrawing their money , Piper executives said very few investors have done so .
A spokeswoman said the decline `` really is the difference in the market value '' of the assets managed by Mr. Bruntjen .
Using the change in managed assets as a rough approximation , the investor losses would total about $ 705 million .
While investment advisers generally are n't responsible for the losses of their investors , several firms recently have felt compelled to compensate investors who have lost money in derivative-laden mutual funds .
Some of those firms have also removed the most damaging derivatives from their funds .
Piper has thus far taken neither of those steps , although it has made a $ 10 million investment in the Institutional fund as a show of confidence .
Many investors are pressing Piper to do more .
And a consortium of Minneapolis lawyers has filed a suit that seeks to obtain compensation for investors in the Institutional fund .
The suit claims that the fund 's prospectus did n't adequately disclose the riskiness of its investment strategy and that marketing materials and oral sales presentations described the fund as a low-risk , principal-preserving investment .
Because of the huge losses suffered by Piper clients , if a court were to order the brokerage firm to pay substantial damages to its clients , it could threaten the future of the venerable Minneapolis financial-services firm .
Piper had shareholder equity of $ 168.9 million at the end of June .
A lawsuit by clients seeking class-action status has already been filed in federal district court in Minneapolis .
Piper executives dismiss the idea that the firm 's survival is at stake .
`` We have had a long and distinguished history , '' Mr. Piper said .
`` We have to keep this in perspective .
'' Mr. Bruntjen 's investment strategy worked extremely well prior to the recent rise in interest rates , allowing his funds to produce total returns last year that were about twice as great as other mortgage investments .
The Institutional fund had been the best performing of the short-term U.S. government funds , and Piper officials point out that many investors who have seen paper losses this year have made substantial gains from Mr. Bruntjen 's investments in the past .
In any event , when interest rates began rising this year , the value of Mr. Bruntjen 's investments crashed .
The Institutional fund , which at its peak had more than $ 800 million in assets , has become the worst performing fund of its kind .
`` Worth was getting 15 % returns when everyone else was getting 7 % returns , '' said James Snyder , a portfolio manager with IDS Financial Services , a subsidiary of American Express Co. `` The only way to get that is derivatives and leverage .
Everyone took a little risk -- he took a lot more than everyone else .
'' Mr. Bruntjen also managed a large amount of money in private accounts for both individuals and institutions .
The minimum size of those investments was $ 1 million , but a Piper spokeswoman said the average size was $ 20 million .
Short interest on the Nasdaq Stock Market hit a new high in August , rising to 849.3 million shares from 835.3 million in July , a 1.7 % increase .
Traders said that this latest rise in Nasdaq short interest played a role in yesterday 's powerful stock market rally .
Some traders described the rally as a `` short-squeeze , '' in which short sellers are forced to close out their bearish bets and , consequently , exaggerate the upward move in prices .
A short sale is a bet that a stock will tumble .
Investors sell borrowed shares , knowing that they must eventually be replaced for return to the lender .
If the replacement shares cost less than those sold earlier , the short seller makes a profit .
Short interest is the total of shares sold short at any given time and not yet covered .
In general , an increase in short interest indicates that investors believe stocks are overpriced and are set to fall .
On the other hand , a big increase in short interest can also fuel a rally as short sellers-fearing losses as the market or specific stocks turn upward-might rush to replace the shares they ` ve borrowed .
Such `` short-covering '' can provide an important boost to any stock-market recovery , as was the case yesterday , traders said .
The August data , released yesterday by the National Association of Securities Dealers , include all the short interest positions reported July 18 through Aug. 8 and settled as of Aug. 15 .
Short interest on the Nasdaq National Market , comprising the larger-capitalization issues , rose 1.8 % to 800.8 million shares from 786.7 million .
Among the small-cap stocks , which make up a third of the Nasdaq market , short interest fell marginally to 48.5 million shares from 48.6 million .
The decline partly reflected an improvement in small-cap stock performance in recent weeks , traders said .
The Nasdaq National Market 's short-interest ratio as of mid-August fell to 3.32 from 3.43 a month ago .
The short-interest ratio for the smallest Nasdaq stocks fell to 1.52 from 1.58 a month ago .
The ratio -- the number of trading days that would be required to close out the short position through share purchases -- is viewed as a measure of trading sentiment .
Among the companies with the largest short positions as of mid-August , short interest in American Power Conversion Corp. climbed 760,164 shares to 9.8 million ; Cott Corp. fell 10,112 shares to 8.8 million and Dell Computer Corp. rose 305,331 shares to 8.7 million .
The Nasdaq stocks with the largest volume increases in short interest were Nextel Communications Inc. , up 2.2 million shares to 6.9 million ; Biogen Inc. , up 2.1 million shares to 4.9 million , and Quantum Corp. , up 1.6 million shares to 6.2 million .
Those with the largest volume decreases were Snapple Beverage Corp. , down 3.2 million shares to 6.1 million ; Apple Computer Inc. , down 2.6 million shares to six million , and Electronic Arts Inc. , down 1.4 million shares to 6.8 million .
The following table shows the Nasdaq issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed at mid-August , or in which the short position had changed by at least 50,000 shares since mid-July .
LIMA , Peru -LRB- Reuter -RRB- -- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori revoked his wife 's official functions as first lady because of her `` incomprehensible '' criticism of the government and apparent wish to become president herself .
`` I have decided to separate my wife Susana Higuchi from her functions as first lady , '' Mr. Fujimori said in a latenight televised address .
`` From now on , Mrs. Higuchi can carry out her political activities in open opposition to the government when and where she pleases , like any citizen , but not as first lady , '' he said .
In addition to hinting at her own presidential aspirations , the first lady has alleged that some government ministers appeared to be involved in cases of corruption and criticized a key adviser to Mr. Fujimori as `` bad for Peru .
'' In a statement , Mrs. Higuchi accused her husband of lying and `` twisting my words .
'' The two have been living apart since her protest this month over a law that bans her from seeking office or criticizing his rule .
The president and the couple 's three teenage children are living at army headquarters .
WASHINGTON -- The gender gap on SAT scores shrank this year , with women 's marks rising as men 's fell .
Women 's average scores rose three points on the math test and one point on the verbal exam , while men 's scores dropped three on the verbal test and one on math , according to the New York-based College Board , which sponsors the tests .
But men 's average scores remain higher than women 's .
Their average math score this year was 501 out of a possible 800 , 41 points higher than the women 's average of 460 .
The verbal gap was much smaller , with men scoring an average of 425 and women 421 .
The gender gap may be closing because women are taking more academic courses in high school , said Donald Stewart , president of the College Board .
`` Academic study makes a difference , '' he said .
In 1994 , 44 % of women took 20 or more year-long academic courses in high school , up from 36 % in 1987 .
Just 37 % of men took that many year-long academic classes this year , up from 31 % in 1987 .
The increased enrollment of women in academic courses is particularly striking in advanced math and science classes .
Now , 41 % of female high-school students take physics , for instance , compared with 34 % in 1987 .
More women than men take English grammar and composition courses , although a smaller percentage of all students now take four or more years of English than in the late 1980s .
Overall , the average verbal score for students graduating in 1994 was 423 , down one point from last year , while the average math score was 479 , up one point .
SATs , or Scholastic Aptitude Tests , are administered several times a year to high-school juniors and seniors .
College Board administrators said they were worried about the eight-point slide in verbal scores over the past eight years , saying it could be due not only to students taking fewer English classes , but also to reading less and watching more television .
MEXICO CITY -- Tensions are rising in Mexico 's southernmost state of Chiapas , scene of a bloody insurrection earlier this year , with both the ruling party and leftist gubernatorial candidates claiming victory .
The official count shows the state going for federal Sen. Eduardo Robledo Rincon of the ruling party , known as the PRI .
But backers of Amado Avendano , a newspaper publisher whose campaign is linked to the demands of the self-styled Zapatista rebels , has alleged ballot fraud .
The Zapatista rebels launched a January uprising in Chiapas , seizing government buildings in four municipalities , including the colonial city of San Cristobal de las Casas .
Yesterday , the city hall in San Cristobal was reportedly surrounded by several dozen police officers in riot gear .
Officials feared that Mr. Avendano and his Party of the Democratic Revolution , or PRD , would try to prevent the PRI from taking control in the troubled state , now led by an interim PRI governor .
When Kristin Coonley , a graduate student in Boston looks into her closet these days , she has a question : Could some of her clothing go up in flames ?
Many women have been wondering the same thing since the Consumer Product Safety Commission in Washington recalled some 250,000 rayon skirts made in India , deeming them dangerously flammable .
The safety commission warned women to return skirts they had purchased and not to wear the ones they own .
But the flammable garments are so hard to distinguish from other long , flowing skirts on the market that many consumers are n't sure which ones are unsafe .
`` It can be confusing , '' says Ms. Coonley in Boston .
`` I think I have two dresses , but I do n't know if they 're the recall fabric .
'' Laurie Bruce , a tour guide in Hilton Head , S.C. , is equally perplexed .
`` I have a miniskirt made of rayon , '' she says .
`` Is that bad ?
'' Since the safety commission began publicizing the ban , its largest clothing recall ever , consumers have clogged the agency 's hotline with thousands of calls .
`` People were calling up asking about their scarves , '' says Robin Diamond , a spokeswoman for the safety commission .
`` People were worried .
They looked in their closet and saw chiffon , so they called .
'' There has been so much confusion , in fact , that the safety commission issued an update last Friday to clarify the recall .
The skirts in questions , which sell for $ 6 to $ 80 , are made only in India .
They are made entirely of rayon fibers , or of a combination of 65 % rayon and 35 % cotton , and have a sheer chiffon fabric over a gauze lining .
The recall does n't include dresses , pants , scarves or skirts made of 100 % cotton .
Under the agency 's mandatory ban , big retailers such as Marshall Field 's and Filene 's Basement were forced to immediately remove the garments from their shelves .
The commission can levy civil fines of as much as $ 1.25 million on retailers that continue to sell the skirts .
It can also seek to prosecute violators under criminal laws and obtain penalties of as much as a year in jail .
Yet some customers are still worried about encountering the garments in stores .
`` Is this it ?
'' asks Nancy Syrnas , as she pulls a brown rayon skirt with purple dots off the rack at Harper 's clothing store in Washington .
It is n't one of the recalled skirts , but Vernetta Dance , assistant manager at Harper 's , says plenty of customers have called to check .
Other women say they will ignore the unusual ban , despite safety-commisson warnings that the skirts can be consumed by flames in less than three seconds .
Diane Irons , who has a national radio talk show on fashion and image , says , `` A lot of people called me on my show and said , ` So what ?
' '' about the skirt recall .
`` In all my years , I 've never heard of skirts being recalled , '' she says .
`` People who want to wear them are going to wear them .
'' In Steamboat Springs , Colo. , `` Everybody wears them , '' says Lindsey Grannis , 25 .
She says she will continue to wear her skirt .
So will Rita Robinson , an assistant comptroller for Energy Daily in Washington .
Ms. Robinson says the only safety problem she has with her long , flowing skirt is that `` I ride over it in my chair and almost fall over .
'' NEW YORK -- Johnson & Johnson introduced a device that helps alleviate one of the thorniest problems in treatment of heart disease : the recurrence of blocked arteries after angioplasty procedures .
The announcement coincided with the publication of two studies showing that the device , called a stent , reduces incidence of new blockages -- known to cardiologists as restenosis -- by 25 % to 30 % .
The problem occurs in 30 % to 50 % of the 300,000 angioplasty procedures done in the U.S. each year , in which a tiny balloon is threaded into a patient 's coronary arteries and inflated to flatten obstructions against artery walls .
As a result of restenosis , many patients have to undergo repeat angioplasty or bypass surgery to alleviate their heart-disease symptoms .
For more than a decade , researchers have tested dozens of devices and drugs to prevent restenosis , largely to no avail until now .
The Food and Drug Administration approved the J&J stent for marketing for certain types of patients on Aug. 2 .
`` There 's no question that the J&J stent is a tremendous breakthrough and it 's going to change the way we do angioplasty in the U.S. , '' said Richard Stack , director of interventional cardiology at Duke University Medical Center , Durham , N.C. But the transformation wo n't happen overnight .
For one thing , cardiologists need to be trained to use the stent , a process that J&J is sponsoring at 13 heart centers across the U.S. `` We 've got 4,000 doctors to train , '' said Richard Schatz , coinventor of the J&J stent and research director for interventional cardiology at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation , La Jolla , Calif. .
He said it will take a year to train these physicians .
For another , stents are initially more costly than routine angioplasty because doctors need to administer blood-thinning drugs while using the current version of the device , a factor that results in longer hospital stays for patients .
Moreover , in the two studies , restenosis occured in 22 % to 32 % of patients who were treated with the stent , indicating the current technology , while an improvement , still is far from solving the problem .
However , interest among cardiologists is high .
Marvin L. Woodall , president of Johnson & Johnson Interventional Systems Co. , the unit that is marketing the device , said the company is getting 200 inquiries a day .
About 1,600 people , including 800 doctors and 800 nurses , have signed up for courses , filling available slots through the end of the year , Mr. Woodall said .
The stent is a thin wire tube resembling scaffolding that props open an artery when inserted at the point where fatty deposits and plaque have built up .
It is inserted on the same type of balloon-tipped device used in regular angioplasty and left in place when the balloon is withdrawn .
A U.S. trial involving 410 patients found that patients with the stent had a larger immediate increase in the opening of a blocked artery , a key indicator of the device 's success , researchers said .
The rate of restenosis was about 31.6 % , compared with 42.1 % for patients treated with angioplasty alone , and stent patients followed for six months underwent fewer procedures to retreat the original blockage than angioplasty patients did .
A European trial involving 520 patients had similar results , with an even lower rate of restenosis among stent patients .
But Dr. Patrick W. Serruys of Erasmus University , Rotterdam , the Netherlands , said stent patients had a longer hospital stay and higher risk of bleeding complications at the site where the catheter was inserted , reflecting the use of blood thinners intended to reduce the chance of clotting around the stent itself .
Both studies , which were funded in part by J&J , appear in today 's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine .
J&J is testing a more advanced version of the stent in Europe , in which blood thinners are attached directly to the device to prevent the need for systemic administration of the drugs .
Early indications are that bleeding complications are sharply reduced as a result , with the expectation that hospital stays would be shortened .
Dr. Martin Leon , of Washington Hospital Center , Washington , D.C. , said an economic analysis of the data , which was n't in the published reports , shows that while hospital costs for stent patients initially are higher , they even out when patients are followed for a year , reflecting reduced need for repeat procedures .
THE U.S. EXPANDED Guantanamo 's camps amid a flood of Cuban boat people .
The Clinton administration rushed to double the absorption capacity at the U.S. base in Cuba so that 40,000 Cubans and Haitians can be housed there .
Defense Secretary Perry said the naval facility would be enlarged even further , if necessary .
The Pentagon is preparing to call up some reserve units to handle the flow of Cubans into Guantanamo .
Meanwhile , Havana signaled it would like to open direct talks with Washington on lifting a trade embargo , but the U.S. opposes high-level negotiations .
Clinton 's reaction is colored by his experience in 1980 , when he lost a gubernatorial re-election bid after rioting rocked an Arkansas army base housing Cubans from the Mariel boatlift .
Senate Minority Leader Dole presented 13 changes the GOP wants in the pending crime bill , as the Senate remained tied up in a stalemate over the legislation .
Majority Leader Mitchell said he would discuss the GOP proposal with his caucus today .
But he said he doubted Democratic lawmakers would like it .
The president portrayed Senate moderates as trapped in an `` ideological box '' in refusing to back his proposed cost controls on medical expenditures and a requirement that employers help pay for workers ' insurance .
Without these provisions , health reform becomes dependent on wasteful subsidies , he said .
Mexican riot police surrounded the city hall in the southern city of San Cristobal de las Casas , hoping to prevent a clash between the two sides claiming victory in Sunday 's gubernatorial vote .
The official vote count showed an apparent victory for the ruling party candidate , but a rebel-backed candidate claimed victory .
A judge refused to force the NAACP to reinstate its fired executive director , and the civil-rights group later said it would discuss an amicable settlement with Chavis .
Chavis told reporters he hoped to avoid a full-blown legal fight with the NAACP , but added that he would return to court if the settlement offer does n't satisfy him .
Russian authorities seized two unemployed men who had stolen nearly 22 pounds of industrial-grade uranium from the once-secret Arzamas-16 nuclear complex in central Russia .
Saturday 's arrest was the latest in a series of cases involving the theft of nuclear materials from Russian plants and research facilities .
Israel signed over the Ramallah school district to Palestinian authorities , giving PLO leader Arafat his first formal foothold outside Jericho in the West Bank .

Muslim-led government troops raped and killed Bosnian civilians and looted and burned houses when they captured the rebel Muslim enclave of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia , refugee survivors alleged .
Many of the refugees who fled to Croatia on Sunday blamed the actions of the government army for their refusal to return home .
Russia 's foreign minister plans to go to Belgrade this weekend in a bid to persuade Yugoslav leaders to accept international monitoring of their border with Bosnia , according to U.N. diplomats .
Clinton condemned Iran as `` the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism '' and pledged to try to curb Tehran 's activities .
In remarks to the Jewish service organization , B'nai B'rith , the president appealed to U.S. allies to `` recognize the true nature of Iranian intentions '' and help convince Iran that its `` rogue behavior '' wo n't be tolerated .
The gender gap on SAT scores narrowed this year , with women 's marks rising as men 's fell .
However , men 's average scores remained higher .
Overall , the average verbal score for students graduating in 1994 was 423 , down one point from last year , while the average math score was 479 , up one point .
The eventual death toll may rise above one million in Rwanda , a U.N. official said .
The previous estimate for deaths since early April had been 500,000 , a figure given by the Red Cross .
Meanwhile , senior officers of Rwanda 's former army returned to the capital , Kigali , for talks with the rebels who defeated them , the U.N. said .
As one stock-market veteran sees it , the economy is like an overly exuberant dog that jumps on people , and the Federal Reserve is like a man with a rolled-up newspaper .
The man taps the dog lightly , trying to get it to sit .
But one or two light taps rarely suffice .
Eventually the man gives the dog a whack , and it lies down whimpering .
So does the stock market .
That 's why stock pros are watching the Fed warily nowadays , even as the stock market surges this week .
If the Fed raises the widely watched discount rate just one more time , it will trigger the `` three steps and a stumble '' doctrine outlined decades ago by stock-market technician Edson Gould .
This bit of market lore says that three consecutive boosts -LRB- three steps -RRB- in the discount rate foreshadow a stock-market drop -LRB- stumble -RRB- .
Bulls figure that the Fed , by heading off inflation before it gets serious , is actually helping the stock market .
But bears say they 've never seen a string of interest-rate boosts that was good for stocks .
Market history lines up mostly on the side of the bears .
Rate increases do n't always lead to stock-market losses .
But on average they do lead to subnormal returns .
So what is the Fed -- friend or enemy -- for the stock market today ?
Friend , says Stefan Abrams , a money manager for Trust Co. of the West .
`` I think what they 're doing is absolutely fabulous for the stock market , '' he says .
By raising interest rates , he figures , the Fed is wisely `` being pre-emptive .
'' He also likes the way Fed officials hint at their moves in advance , giving the stock market time to adjust : `` I do n't know how any central bank could do it any better .
'' Enemy , counters Charles LaLoggia , editor of LaLoggia 's Special Situation Report .
`` When the Fed gets serious and starts to raise rates in a significant manner , that 's bad for the stock market , '' he says .
`` It always has been that way , and it always will be , despite what the ` spin doctors ' say .
'' Many market professionals say the old three-step guideline is still a good one .
According to Richard McCabe , chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch , the three-steps rule has worked eight out of nine times since World War II .
The warning bells were correct , he says , in August 1948 , September 1955 , March 1959 , December 1965 , April 1968 , May 1973 , December 1980 and February 1989 .
-LRB- The one flub , by Mr. McCabe 's reckoning , was January 1978 .
The three-steps rule sounded an alarm in January , but stocks had already been declining for about two years , and bottomed out only a month after the warning signal .
-RRB- Others say Mr. McCabe is too generous to the rule , because he allows for varying lead times -- up to a year or so -- between the flash of a warning signal and the start of a big decline .
Using a stricter standard -- that stocks must be down precisely 12 months after the warning signal flashes -- the rule has worked only five times out of nine since World War II .
Several market professionals say there 's nothing magic about the third discount-rate increase .
A study by E.K. Easton Ragsdale of Kidder Peabody shows that stocks , on average , are down 0.9 % three months after any increase in the discount rate .
Six months after a rise , stocks are down an average of 0.3 % .
Twelve months after , stocks are up an average of 1.5 % -- well below the normal annual gain of 8.3 % .
The Ragsdale study includes all 50 discount-rate increases from 1946 through 1993 .
Its figures do n't include dividends .
Mr. Ragsdale is quick to add that there is `` gigantic variability '' in the data .
Stocks have taken big tumbles after rate increases , but there have also been times when stocks have risen handsomely in spite of Fed tightening .
`` Clearly , '' says Mr. Ragsdale , `` there must be other factors at work , too .
'' But just as clearly , the Federal Reserve Board is one of the bigger influences on stocks .
`` The Fed is the pulse of the market , '' says Walter Kass , president of Curators Capital Management .
This year 's actions are an about-face for the Fed : It had lowered the discount rate seven times from December 1990 through July 1992 , then had left it alone for nearly two years .
Tracy Herrick , a San Francisco-based investment strategist for Jefferies & Co. , says the time period for warning signals appears to be shortening .
Today even a single discount-rate boost is cause for concern , he says .
Nevertheless , he thinks other factors will keep the stock market afloat for at least the next few months .
He believes the U.S. will sign a trade agreement with Japan and corporate profits will be strong .
Also , he says , `` you do n't get bear markets '' when investors are as scared as they are today .
While many people focus on the discount rate , money manager Martin Zweig is more worried about the recent increases in the federal-funds rate .
Mr. Zweig says that when the federal-funds rate is rising rapidly , as it is today , stock prices have fallen at the rate of more than 7 % a year .
By contrast , when the federal-funds rate was falling rapidly , stocks have risen at a 29 % - a-year clip .
`` In other words , '' Mr. Zweig summarizes , `` Do n't fight the Fed .
'' To Mr. Ragsdale of Kidder Peabody , the Fed is just giving some bad-tasting but bracing medicine to the economy .
`` We live in a world where expectations matter a great deal , '' he says .
`` If investors believe that the Fed is staying on top of inflation , they 're going to be more optimistic .
'' But Glen King Parker of the Institute for Econometric Research in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , is dubious .
`` The Fed 's objective in tightening is always to constrain inflation , '' he says .
`` The Fed never sets out to hurt the market .
It is trying to do what 's best for the economy .
'' But in practice , he says , rising interest rates generally hurt stocks .
For this and other reasons , his institute predicts an 11 % decline in stocks during the next year ; that would put the Dow Jones Industrial Average near 3300 .
REDWOOD CITY , Calif. -- 3DO Co. , a closely watched startup hurt by initial weak sales , unveiled plans to dramatically boost power and performance of its video-game players through a new PowerPC microprocessor .
The PowerPC chips will be used in an add-on accessory to existing 3DO machines that analysts say could give 3DO a performance edge on competitors .
The M2 Accelerator add-on is expected to be available in late 1995 as big rivals such as Nintendo Co. and Sega Enterprises Ltd. are hitting the market with their new game machines .
`` It 's a very big deal , '' said Lee Isgur , managing director at Jefferies & Co. in San Francisco .
`` They will have something in advance of everyone else .
'' Still , 3DO 's move came as a pleasant surprise on Wall Street , where once-moribund 3DO shares surged $ 2.125 , or 11 % , to $ 21.625 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday .
It also comes as a boost to International Business Machines Corp. and Motorola Inc. , which will be supplying the PowerPC chips they helped develop for use in computers of all sizes .
Apple Computer Inc. , also a member of the group that developed PowerPC , has shipped PowerPC-fueled Macintoshes since March , and IBM is expected to soon begin shipping its PowerPC line of personal computers .
Sales of the 3DO Multiplayer have suffered in the U.S. since the machine 's debut last year , in part because users complain the games run too slow on the compact-disk drive .
3DO officials said July sales in the U.S. perked up to their best monthly results ever , and that about 200,000 of the units have been sold world-wide by its only current manufacturer , Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. .
The World 's Greatest Deliberative Body has tied itself in knots over the crime bill .
The bill 's opponents worry about the $ 33 billion cost , but its defenders say that 's all a smoke screen for the National Rifle Association .
The most important business of the Republic , they say , is banning assault weapons .
So it might be fair to ask , what 's an `` assault weapon , '' anyway ?
Now , the weapons in question are not machine guns ; automatic weapons have been illegal in this country since 1934 .
Rather , they are semi-automatics , capable of firing shots as fast as the shooter can pull the trigger .
But most modern rifles are semi-automatics , and no one yet admits a desire to confiscate hunting rifles .
So someone has to decide which semi-automatics are dreaded assault weapons .
They tell by looking at the weapon ; an assault weapon is in the eye of the beholder .
If you think we jest , we refer you to Senator Dianne Feinstein , the WGDB 's leading expert on aesthetics and semantics .
The Feinstein amendment , passed by the Senate last November and now part of the pending legislation , spelled out which weapons to ban .
She and her aides riffled through their picture albums , picked out 19 weapons they especially did n't like and banned them by name .
One is the Colt AR-15 , pictured here along with the Ruger Mini-14 , which would remain legal -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- WSJ August 25 , 1994 -RRB- .
The two are both semi-automatics firing the same 5.56 mm ammunition .
In the hands of a criminal , they could each do the same damage ; no more , no less .
The difference between the two ?
The AR-15 looks more menacing because it has a plastic stock and a pistol grip ; that 's it .
After listing the 19 aesthetic offenders , the Feinstein brain trust apparently cross-tabulated its critical judgments to draw up a checklist of five aesthetic markers : a folding stock , too large a pistol grip , a bayonet mount , a flash suppressor and a grenade launcher .
Two strikes and it 's an assault weapon , the WGDB decided ; either a grenade launcher or a bayonet mount is OK , but not both .
Now , we 'd agree that ordinary citizens do n't have much need for bayonet mounts , but on the other hand , do you know anyone who was mugged with a grenade launcher ?
Statistics from around the country suggest that few criminals are deranged or dimwitted enough to call attention to themselves by lugging around military-looking paraphernalia .
So-called assault weapons are used in only a tiny , tiny fraction of the violent crimes .
In 1990 , Florida 's Commission on Assault Weapons reported that over the previous three-year period , assault weapons were used in 0.14 % of violent crimes .
In New York City , police confiscated 16,378 firearms in 1988 , only 80 of which could be called assault weapons .
Even a liberal such as Richard Cohen pointed out in a recent Washington Post column that according to the 1992 Uniform Crime Report , `` more people were beaten to death that year -LRB- 1,114 -RRB- than were killed by rifles of any kind -LRB- 698 -RRB- .
'' But perhaps the best commentary came from Joseph Constance , deputy chief of police in Trenton , New Jersey .
He told the Senate Judiciary Committee last August : `` Since police started keeping statistics , we now know that assault weapons are\/were used in an underwhelming 0.026 of 1 % of crimes in New Jersey .
This means that my officers are more likely to confront an escaped tiger from the local zoo than to confront an assault rifle in the hands of a drug-crazed killer on the streets .
'' The real question is why the Senate wants to tie itself into knots over so frivolous an issue .
Both sides of the gun-control debate see an assault-weapons ban as the first step toward confiscating all firearms , we suppose , and that in turn evokes the ultimate liberal-conservative division over whether the root cause of crime is original sin .
This remains in the realm of symbolism , and perhaps the WGDB wants to spend its August evenings striking postures .
But in protecting the public from crime , it could scarcely be clearer , the assault-weapons ban would fire a blank .

The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a change in accounting rules for popular derivatives that , if enforced , could result in millions of dollars of write-downs for publicly traded companies , particularly banks , according to derivatives experts .
At issue is whether companies engaging in certain complex swaps would have to recognize losses and gains in the market value of those contracts on their earnings statements , rather than carrying them on their books at cost as many do now .
Although Walter Schuetze , chief accountant to the SEC , notes that no policy change has yet been made , the SEC 's response to a recent question about the accounting treatment of one common type of complex swap is raising hackles in the financial community .
The question involved `` index-amortizing swaps , '' which are often used by dealers to hedge options risk and by regional banks and other investors to enhance yields .
In response to an informal inquiry , an SEC official told an accounting firm that all index-amortizing swaps may require `` mark-to-market '' accounting , meaning that their value must be adjusted daily to reflect the impact of changing interest rates .
And because rising rates have cut the value of such swaps this year , applying that rule to outstanding swaps of publicly traded companies could cause widespread markdowns in their holdings .
Mr. Schuetze acknowledges that the SEC 's approach may have serious repercussions .
`` In the banking community , this probably does have broad implications , because as I understand it , quite a few banks have entered into '' such swaps , he says .
Unlike Wall Street dealers , `` it 's the end users who typically are not marking to market their contracts -- that includes First National Bank of Anytown , U.S.A. '' According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , there were as much as $ 150 billion of index-amortizing swaps outstanding in 1993 , and analysts say the market continued to grow until the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in February .
Banks alone are estimated to hold about $ 120 billion of such contracts .
Index-amortizing swaps are derivatives designed to act as substitutes for mortgage-backed bonds ; their interest and principal payments , which change in line with interest rates , are devised to behave more predictably than those of actual mortgage securities .
Like normal swaps , index-amortizing swaps are private agreements to exchange floating-interest-rate payments for fixed-rate payments over time .
But unlike normal swaps , the underlying principal amount in these deals is n't fixed .
Instead , it decreases , or `` amortizes , '' over time .
Not only that , the rate of decrease varies with interest rates -- speeding up when rates fall and slowing when rates rise .
As a result , when rates are rising , as they have been lately , these swaps tend to lose value more quickly than normal swaps or normal bond investments .
The SEC is under attack for perceived regulatory lapses following stunning derivatives losses at Procter & Gamble Co. and other companies earlier this year .
While P&G 's losses involved a different type of swap entirely , and one whose losses were multiplied by leveraged options that were embedded in them , the SEC appears to be reluctant to make such distinctions .
The SEC believes that swap contracts should be marked to market unless the institution can prove they 're being used as a hedge .
What the SEC 's latest instruction appears to mean , derivatives experts add , is that certain options features in index-amortizing swaps preclude them from qualifying as a hedge .
Thus , any loss in the swap 's market value would have to be recorded on a company 's earnings statement , says Robert Willins , tax specialist at Lehman Brothers Inc. .
Columbus , Ohio-based Banc One Corp. , a leading investor in index-amortizing swaps with holdings of about $ 15 billion at the end of 1993 , says it uses hedge accounting for that portfolio .
That treatment `` has been blessed by the accountants as well as the regulators , '' says Steven Bluhm , vice president in funds management .
But in light of the SEC 's informal directive , `` we are in an absolute wait-and-see mode '' for a final ruling on the matter , he adds .
What apparently bothers the SEC is the options risk contained in index-amortizing swaps : Like mortgage-backed bonds , these swaps ' performance is akin to owning normal bonds and selling , or `` writing , '' interest-rate calls against them .
In effect , such calls give the fixed-rate payer the right , without obligation , to prepay the debt when rates fall .
But the fixed-rate payer has an incentive to exercise that option only when it 's detrimental to the investor , in this case the bank holding the swap .
To compensate for that prepayment risk , such swaps pay high yields .
The SEC 's Mr. Schuetze says the Financial Accounting Standards Board , which has been working to develop derivatives accounting rules for more than two years , will help decide the ultimate outcome .
`` The main question the FASB is dealing with is what are the risks that are eligible for hedging , '' he says .
`` Where the FASB tentatively is headed is to require that all these free-standing derivative contracts be marked to market .
'' If the SEC is , in fact , enforcing mark-to-market accounting for derivatives with embedded options , companies may not learn of the change until they have to file third-quarter financial statements , accountants say .
But as a precaution , some investment bankers have been warning clients of possible SEC action .
`` It will be very interesting to see whether those swaps are grandfathered '' for accounting purposes , said one derivatives dealer .
`` If not , two or three banks will have to report large hits .
'' China clamped down on prices and abandoned price liberalization at least for the rest of this year .
The Beijing leadership urged adoption of `` every possible measure '' to slash inflation , which ran at a 24 % annual rate in the first half .
Plans to free prices of government-controlled commodities will be suspended for this year , the Xinhua news agency said .
China 's cabinet advised local governments to find ways to boost food production to take upward pressure off prices .
It said governments ' performances would be measured by their effectiveness at containing inflation , and echoed a warning by the Internal Commerce Ministry against profiteering and price-gouging .
The moves indicated that China 's claims earlier this summer that it had conquered inflation were premature .
Last summer , the government imposed sweeping austerity measures in an effort to contain inflation , and late last year , it froze prices of some basic commodities .

Competitive pressures will prevent Europe 's nascent economic recovery from creating jobs , the European Union said .
In its annual report on industry , the 12-country trade bloc 's commission said interest-rate cuts have boosted domestic demand , while companies are slowly starting to benefit from restructurings .
Still , `` The outlook for employment remains grim , '' the EU said .
`` The need for firms to improve productivity to maintain profitability drives employment down , which in turn depresses domestic demand via a general reduction in disposable income .
'' Brides increasingly are being killed in India for providing dowries deemed inadequate by their husbands ' families , the government said in response to a parliamentary inquiry .
Last year , the number of these so-called dowry deaths rose to 5,582 from 4,836 in 1990 ; in that four-year period , 20,537 brides were put to death , often by being set on fire .
Though India in 1961 outlawed dowry payments , the practice is still widespread among Hindus , who account for about 80 % of the country 's 900 million people .
Wives ' families can be impoverished by post-marriage demands by husbands and their families for gifts , usually cash , autos and consumer goods .

The latest arrests came in police and army raids on currency traders in Baghdad , Basra , Mosul and other cities .

Yamaha Corp. and Kawai Musical Instruments Co. , which together control 90 % of the global musical-instrument market , are selling a piano with an unlikely new pitch : silence .
The two Japanese companies have come up with a full-sized upright that offers pianists the option of hearing themselves only by plugging in headphones .
And in Japan , where neighborhoods are closely knit and noise pollution can be a problem , sales are far outstripping forecasts : Yamaha and Kawai combined expect to sell at least 20,000 silent pianos by March .
That 's nearly double what the two predicted when the pianos were introduced late last year .
But it seems that noise pollution inside the home is helping drive sales as well .
Takahiro Ono , a 38-year-old telephone company worker about a year ago began taking piano lessons in his Tokyo-area home -- thus becoming his family 's fourth aspiring pianist , after his wife and two daughters .
`` But my mother and father live with us , '' Mr. Ono says .
`` They like to go to bed early .
'' Mr. Ono also had to endure his daughters ' complaints that his practice sessions drowned out the television .
So when Yamaha began advertising a solution last year , Mr. Ono gladly shelled out $ 8,000 for a silent piano .
A Yamaha survey found that 44 % of customers say that , like Mr. Ono , they do n't want to make noise in the home ; 33 % would n't have purchased a traditional piano .
Demographics certainly have changed .
In the 1960s and 1970s , Yamaha and Kawai benefited from a generation of baby boomers longing to be rock stars or the next classical sensation .
Today , most silent-piano customers are these formerly rebellious noisemakers , looking to buy a quiet instrument for their children .
The uprights are just starting to hit the U.S. market , and the companies are betting American parents also will appreciate the sound of silence when Junior practices scales .
The silent piano seems to appeal to other segments of the population as well .
`` At my age , the fingers do n't move as fast as they used to , '' says 68-year-old Yaeko Kojima , who bought a silent piano last year so as not to disturb her semiretired husband .

'' TORONTO -- American Barrick Resources Corp. appears to have won a bidding battle to acquire Lac Minerals Ltd. by raising its offer to $ 1.57 billion and gaining support of Lac 's board .
Lac Minerals executives finally accepted the cash-and-stock offer by American Barrick after rejecting numerous previous offers by both American Barrick and its rival , Royal Oak Mines Inc. .
Executives of Lac Minerals and Barrick said they cobbled together the pact in less than a day of talks after a bidding battle that has been going on for six weeks .
Peter Munk , Barrick 's chairman , said the deal is a `` golden opportunity '' for shareholders of both companies .
For Barrick , one of North America 's biggest gold producers , the takeover of Lac would mean a big step toward its goal of diversifying gold production abroad , especially in Latin America .
If successful , Barrick will become the third-largest western gold producer .
Mr. Munk said Lac shareholders would benefit from Barrick 's more rapid development of Lac 's big gold deposits in Chile .
The combined company would have `` the financial power , the management capability and the international credibility , '' to generate `` exceptional '' shareholder value , he added .
Lac rebuffed Barrick 's first offer last month , and also rejected two cash-and-stock offers by upstart Royal Oak Mines .
Lac Chairman James Pitblado said Lac approached Barrick late Tuesday to seek an increased offer because Barrick 's first bid `` was n't quite enough cash and not quite enough paper .
'' Barrick 's new bid is five Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 3.63 -RRB- in cash , and 0.325 share of Barrick , or alternatively , 0.487 share of Barrick .
Barrick 's first bid was C$ 4 in cash and 0.31 Barrick share .
Based on yesterday 's close , the offer values each Lac share at $ 10.66 .
Lac closed at $ 10.50 , up 25 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
Shares of Barrick were tracking the price of gold higher before the increased offer was announced , but reversed direction and sank 37.5 cents to $ 21.625 on concerns about the increased price and dilution to Barrick shareholders , some analysts said .
The increased offer still requires that two-thirds of Lac 's shareholders tender their shares before Sept. 6 , but several Lac shareholders said they were impressed with Barrick 's increased offer .
`` That 's what we wanted , '' said Normand Lamarche , a fund manager at Altamira Management Ltd. in Toronto , who had been holding back several million Lac shares while waiting for an increased offer from Barrick .
`` Barrick 's challenge now is to quantify the reserves '' at Lac 's properties in South America , which Lac was slow to do , said Victor Flores , who plans to tender the more than one million Lac shares he manages for United Services Advisors Inc. .
Barrick 's Mr. Munk said his company 's gold-mining team is ready to go to work on Lac 's reserves , now that Barrick has largely completed a $ 1 billion mine development program at its flagship Goldstrike property in Nevada .
`` It 's been an arduous process , '' said Lac 's Mr. Pitblado , who for weeks insisted that Lac shareholders would be better served by an independent company .
Lac determined , however , that Barrick 's increased offer is the best option for shareholders , he said .
Royal Oak 's competing cash-and-stock bid , which expires Sept. 6 , values each Lac share at $ 11.99 .
Despite the higher offer , Mr. Pitblado and some Lac shareholders said Barrick 's offer is more valuable .
Lac has criticized the value of Royal Oak 's stock because of the company 's high costs and low-grade ore reserves .
`` Barrick 's growth record speaks for itself , '' said Mr. Pitblado .
`` It 's been absolutely outstanding .
'' Barrick and Lac are both based in Toronto .
Royal Oak is based in Vancouver , British Columbia .
Barrick said it has n't determined if Lac 's newly appointed chief executive Peter Steen will run Lac if Barrick 's takeover is successful .
Mr. Pitblado indicated that his role as non-executive chairman of Lac is temporary .
Barrick President Robert Smith said the company will evaluate Lac 's Canadian assets with a mind toward selling them as Barrick had planned if it acquires Lac .

MEXICO CITY -- Assuming Mexico 's post-election jitters settle into calm , in 1995 the country may achieve its strongest economic growth in five years , economists say , igniting a consumption boom that many U.S. exporters are betting on .
A survey of six Mexican and foreign economists shows average expectations of 4 % growth in Mexican gross domestic product next year .
That would be the strongest since 1990 , when the economy grew 4.4 % .
`` We are already starting an economic recovery that will strengthen now that the elections are over , '' says Jonathan Heath , chief economist at Macro Asesoria Economica , a research firm here .
`` Growth is on the way .
'' The ruling PRI won overwhelmingly in Sunday 's national elections , extending its grip on government into a seventh decade .
Growth in the Mexican economy has far-reaching implications for the U.S. now that the two countries are linked with Canada by the North American Free Trade Agreement .
U.S. retailers , auto companies and even telephone companies are making a colossal bet on rising Mexican incomes .
What 's more , stronger growth `` is good for U.S. exporters and it does generate U.S. jobs , '' says Luis R. Luis , economist at the investment firm Scudder , Stevens & Clark Inc. .
Growth expectations could be damped if political tensions increase .
The leading opposition party and a citizens group are contesting the fairness of Sunday 's national elections .
In San Cristobal de Las Casas , in Chiapas state , riot police surrounded the city hall to prevent a clash between opposing political parties claiming victory in the state governor 's race .
Meanwhile , the commission set up to ensure the fairness of Sunday 's balloting called for an investigation into its finding that someone had tried , but failed , to infect vote-counting computers with a virus .
In Mexico 's 1988 presidential elections , the computer crashed while preliminary results still favored the opposition and not the ruling PRI .
Days later , ruling party candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari was named the winner .
Rumors of violence are troubling investors .
Though the Mexican stock market surged Monday after the elections , it slipped Tuesday and fell yesterday morning before recovering to close with a gain .
Mexico 's economic growth rate has been below 3 % for the past two years , posting only 0.4 % growth last year .
But such slow rates of growth were partly by design .
To lower inflation , Mexican finance officials squeezed the economy with high interest rates and a strong peso .
Inflation rates did tumble -- to 8 % last year from 30 % in 1990 -- though at the expense of thousands of jobs and a steady decline since 1990 in gross domestic product , or the total value of goods and services .
Ernesto Zedillo , unofficial winner of Sunday 's presidential elections , has said he hopes that over the long term he can get the Mexican economy back to what he considers to be its historical growth rate of 6 % or more .
In recent interviews , Mexican finance officials acknowledged that inflation expectations , while always a risk , seem to have diminished .
Finance Minister Pedro Aspe , for example , said he was pleased to see that the economy grew at a 3.8 % rate in the second quarter with no significant gains in inflation -- this during a period when the peso fell 10 % against the dollar .
`` This is the first time we had the exchange rate depreciate while the inflation rate did n't move , '' Mr. Aspe said .
In a sign that the government is embracing faster growth rates , Mexico 's central bank this week capped the peso 's ability to appreciate against the dollar to 3.25 pesos .
The peso cap signifies that the government does n't want to sacrifice growth in exports , a bright light in the economy here , by letting the currency strengthen to the point where goods become more expensive in foreign markets .
`` I see policy shifting toward a progrowth stance , '' says Mr. Luis , the economist for Scudder , Stevens & Clark .
`` They are willing to tolerate a slower decline in inflation for some growth .
'' Along with exports , economists expect investment spending to fuel economic growth .
For example , the arrival of foreign banks and brokerage firms in Mexico could create thousands of jobs and bring in $ 2 billion of fresh investment .
`` The famous investments from the North American Free Trade Agreement that never came because of Chiapas and the Colosio assassination '' should start to arrive , said Borja Ussia , president of Grupo Moneda , a research firm here .
He thinks the government will also increase spending on infrastructure projects and other public works .
Lastly , economists expect the leading short-term treasury rate here to fall to about 10.5 % by year end from 13.49 % currently , which is expected to boost demand for credit and purchases of consumer goods .
NEW YORK -- Stephen M. Wolf , former UAL Corp. chairman and chief executive officer , was named a senior adviser to investment firm Lazard Freres & Co. .
Mr. Wolf , 53 years old , recently resigned from UAL following the buyout of a 55 % stake by UAL employees in July .
He had served as chairman and chief executive since December 1987 .
The firm said Mr. Wolf will advise Lazard clients on various business and finance matters .
The position is new .
Over the years , Mr. Wolf has maintained a long-term relationship with Lazard Freres , beginning with a friendship with partner Ira Harris , who runs the firm 's Chicago office , a spokeswoman said .
A professional relationship with the firm later ensued once UAL 's board began working with Lazard , she added .

Hampered by expensive acquisitions , Novell Inc. reported a $ 4 million net loss in its fiscal third quarter , ended July 30 , and said it planned to cut its staff 17 % by early next year .
The Provo , Utah , software concern warned last week that its results would be as much as 20 % below analysts ' expectations because digesting its acquisitions of WordPerfect Corp. and the Quattro Pro spreadsheet business of Borland International Inc. had proved more costly than anticipated .
Novell recently paid $ 1 billion for WordPerfect and Quattro Pro .
The staff cuts have been rumored for some time on Wall Street , but were somewhat higher than some analysts expected .
Novell said the cuts will result in a `` restructuring charge '' in the current quarter ; it did n't specify the size of the charge .
The third-quarter loss equaled one cent a share .
In the year-earlier quarter , Novell reported a net loss of $ 255.4 million , or 80 cents a share .
Revenue rose 79 % to $ 489 million from $ 273 million a year ago .
The third-quarter loss included a $ 120 million charge against earnings from the WordPerfect and Quattro Pro acquisitions .
In the year-ago period , Novell 's loss included a pretax charge of $ 320 million related to acquisitions .
For the nine months , Novell had net income of $ 186 million , or 51 cents a share , including the $ 120 million of acquisition-related charges .
That compared with a loss of $ 104.1 million , or 33 cents a share , including the $ 320 million of acquisition charges .
Nine-month revenue totaled $ 1.056 million , compared with $ 813.7 million the year before .
Novell said it will cut about 1,100 employees in the fiscal fourth quarter through layoffs and attrition , followed by another 650 employee reductions early next year .
The company , a powerhouse in making software that links networks of computers , has grown lately through a string of acquisitions .
The acquisitions are part of a bold plan to challenge giant Microsoft Corp. in various segments of the software business .
But some analysts have fretted that Novell may be overreaching .
Yesterday , in over-the-counter trading , Novell stock closed at $ 14.75 , off 12.5 cents , on volume of 4.1 million shares .
NEW YORK -- Representatives of Major League Baseball 's owners and players met , providing the first hint of progress in the sport 's 13-day-old strike .
The two sides debated the state of the industry for hours but did n't budge from long-established positions .
The owners continue to insist on a salary cap the players adamantly reject .
`` We 're worlds apart as far as the salary cap is concerned , '' said Ed Sprague , a Toronto Blue Jays infielder .
But the presence of 12 baseball club owners and executives , for the first time joining club negotiator Richard Ravitch , may change bargaining-table dynamics .
The session , moderated by federal mediators , produced only rhetoric .
But the very nature and interests of the owners suggest an end to stalemate .
`` To be part of that group shows they want to make a deal , '' said one baseball executive .
`` These are not patient people .
They 'll get tired of fooling around .
'' Talks will resume this morning .
Some 21 players joined union chief Donald Fehr .
They said Mr. Ravitch , acting as sole negotiator , has dug in his heels on the issues .
MONTREAL -- Canadian production of market pulp rose 17 % in July from a year earlier , the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association said .
The industry group said Canadian mills produced 707,000 metric tons of market pulp in July , up from 603,000 metric tons a year earlier .
A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds .
The July operating rate was 98 % , up from 88 % a year earlier , the association reported .
Total market shipments in July rose 24 % to 706,000 metric tons from 570,000 metric tons a year earlier .
Shipments to the U.S. rose 16 % to 217,000 metric tons from 187,000 metric tons a year earlier .
Canadian producer inventories at the end of July were 532,000 metric tons , a 23-day supply , compared with a year-earlier level of 784,000 metric tons , a 42-day supply .
Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper and other products .
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to an affiliated mill .
Notwithstanding naysayers , we 're unconvinced there 's fundamental wrong in the mutual funds boom .
Maybe it will end as unhappily as an earlier one in the late 1960s , maybe it leaves the markets too susceptible to skittish investors , maybe it has lulled naifs into trusting too much the people who manage their money .
But the record merits the benefit of a doubt .
Nearly 30 million U.S. households have been able through this vehicle to participate in one of the great bull markets , though to do so with more apparent level-headedness than in past run-ups .
Yes , the calm could yet be shattered in a rout , but for now it speaks to an acquired sophistication .
Despite that and an environment about as scandal free as any $ 500 billion annual business could manage , some politicians see room for maneuver , especially since the funds industry has blossomed ahead of tight statutory control .
A ruckus is being made about banks selling mutual shares , either through their retail branches or via mergers , such as Mellon 's planned acquisition of Dreyfus .
But the latest preoccupation is with the latitude that many fund managers enjoy to trade in their own accounts .
This matter arose with word that a particularly successful portfolio boss out of Denver was getting in on some handsome side deals .
He and his firm parted ways , but the earth shook underneath the industry .
We make no judgments about propriety in that case , but it 's worth noting that as in a few other securities `` scandals '' of late , victims are in short supply .
The manager was notable because his funds had richly rewarded investors .
-LRB- Indeed , even a celebrated 1980s criminal case involving a portfolio chief never established harm to customers .
Patricia Ostrander , then of Fidelity Investments , was convicted of taking a bribe in the form of a chance to buy warrants in Storer Communications in return for putting her fund into that company 's junk bonds as prepared by Michael Milken 's shop at Drexel Burnham .
Though Ostrander subsequently lost a civil action to Fidelity and faces another one by vestiges of defunct Drexel , the bonds themselves performed well , conflict of interest or not .
-RRB- At the moment , the industry is nervous .
So its trade group , the Investment Company Institute , assembled a blue-ribbon panel to pre-empt the feds by offering up trading restrictions of its own for managers and other sensitive personnel .
The group rejected an outright prohibition on trading , which may be what some in Congress ask after they receive soon a survey on the amount of such inside activity now going on .
That Draconian step may play well on the hustings -LRB- even absent habeas corpus -RRB- , but it would impel more top investment pros to leave the public funds , or else to demand far higher salaried compensation and thus boost management fees for mutual shareholders .
Instead , the industry panel conceived measures intended to prevent circumstances in which cheating on customers might occur .
These would ban fund personnel from taking part in initial public offerings -LRB- a particular concern of SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt -RRB- ; participating in private placements without special permission ; trading in a specific security near the time of their fund company 's movement in or out of the same holding and realizing any profits from holding a security less than 60 days .
The primary aim of these steps is to curb `` front running , '' by which securities insiders trade for themselves ahead of their customers and obtain more favorable prices .
Narrower rules against this practice could be envisioned , but the industry 's graybeards find them insufficient to deal with the real and\/or political problems .
Portfolio managers should have incentives to be on their best game .
The track records of their funds surely figure at bonus time , but no one keeps a keener eye on the market than he with his own cash directly on the line .
In the best of worlds , money managers would invest in the funds they control , but this is unwieldy if the funds are huge -LRB- and thus unable to trade in small stocks or to move in and out nimbly -RRB- or simply too diversified to allow a manager to concentrate his own account on those securities he most likes .
If a manager does pursue his own trades , does his fund benefit from his personal research , or is this an invitation to distraction or worse ?
That 's a call best left to an informed marketplace , but of course there are limits on consumer awareness .
One puritan , Chairman John Bogle of Vanguard Group , would insist on public disclosure of managers ' accounts .
-LRB- His firm contracts out the management of its nonindex equity funds , so it 's easier for him to say that .
-RRB- While we ` re normally high on openness as a disinfectant , that kind of privacy invasion could cost the public funds a lot of talented people .
Let a fund meet that standard if it thinks there 's a market for it .
If all the world 's money rolls toward the fully disclosed managers , well , that settles that .
Vanguard has done well by its customers over the years , but the fact is that rival Fidelity , with a reputation for liberal in-house trading procedures , has served investors just as handsomely .
That exemplifies the basic point about the overall industry : It 's worked fine .
Prudent , generic restraints in a business as prone to excess as securities may be in order , but the saw about fixing what ai n't broke carries weight too .
Most emphatically , the fix ought not be attempted by those on Capitol Hill so unable to make anything work .
The smart money cashed out of those characters long ago .
TOKYO -- A controversy over plans by some of the country 's airlines to hire Japanese contract workers has spotlighted an even more sensitive issue : government meddling in the private sector .
The flap stems from Transportation Minister Shizuka Kamei 's recent threats to punish Japanese airlines for their plans to hire Japanese flight attendants on a contract basis rather than as long-term , salaried workers .
Mr. Kamei , arguing that such newcomers may pose safety risks , said airlines that proceed face possible delayed approval for new flight routes .
Mr. Kamei 's comments sparked an uproar in the nation 's media .
And though on Tuesday he appeared to back away from some of his threatening rhetoric , ministry officials say he remains opposed to Japanese contract flight attendants for safety reasons .
While Mr. Kamei suggested he would look favorably on airlines that assure proper safety training of contract workers , airlines said Wednesday that they had n't received word of a compromise .
Put on Hold The minister 's intervention jeopardizes months of planning by the nation 's airline industry , which has long made public its intention to cut costs by hiring more contract employees .
In recent days , Japan Airlines has put staffing plans on hold pending a review of the minister 's concerns , even though the companies had received tacit approval earlier from lesssenior bureaucrats .
Analysts expect other airlines to follow suit .
`` This was totally out of the blue , '' said JAL spokesman Geoffrey Tudor .
While successful government planning was a key factor in Japan 's postwar economic miracle , the frequent political changes recently and Japan 's long-running economic sluggishness are raising doubts about whether government knows best .
`` What is government doing making airline management decisions ?
'' asked an editorial this week in the Yomiuri newspaper , Japan 's largest .
Other papers also criticized the minister .
In a country famous for close ties between business and bureaucrats , the criticism reflects a growing call for less government interference .
At stake , critics say , is the future of key industries that could lose out to foreign competition .
Some analysts suspect the government 's concern may stem more from an attempt to avoid antagonizing Japan 's labor unions than from worries about lowered work standards .
`` The safety issue is being given on the surface , '' said Ushio Chujo , a business professor at Keio University .
`` Underneath , safety does n't have anything to do with it .
It 's really just a labor issue .
'' Transportation Ministry officials declined to comment about such charges .
The move to hire contract labor was part of a vaunted restructuring of an airline industry hit hard by a strong yen and by low-price foreign competition .
By hiring contract labor -- at roughly half the price of salaried workers -- the nation 's carriers , starting with flagship JAL , had hoped to cut soaring costs that are among the world 's highest .
But Mr. Kamei said the fact that contract and salaried flight attendants would work the same flights threatens safety standards .
Such an arrangement would ruin the `` unified spirit of the team during emergencies , '' he said .
However , JAL has been hiring foreign flight attendants on a contract basis for two decades -- and they have worked in tandem with salaried workers -- raising questions among critics about Mr. Kamei 's objection to hiring domestic flight attendants on a contract basis .
Japan 's leading economic journal , the Nihon Keizai newspaper , said Wednesday that despite the minister 's partial retraction of his threats against the airlines , the practical consequences are unchanged .
Indeed , JAL says it is unlikely the company will go ahead without Mr. Kamei 's approval , illustrating the extent of the informal power that ministers wield over industries they regulate .
WCI STEEL Inc. -LRB- Warren , Ohio -RRB- -- Bret W. Wise , 34 years old , a partner with the Cleveland office of consulting and accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick , was named vice president and chief financial officer of this maker of flat-rolled steel , effective Sept. 1 .
Mr. Wise succeeds John R. Scheessele , 46 , who was named executive vice president in April .
Wellcome PLC , stepping up an acrimonious marketing battle over herpes medicines , sued archrival SmithKline Beecham PLC for patent infringement .
The complaint , filed in federal court in North Carolina where Wellcome 's U.S. unit is located , claims SmithKline 's new anti-viral medicine Famvir breaches the patent of Wellcome 's flagship drug Zovirax .
Wellcome also claims Famvir 's socalled pro-drug mode of delivery infringes another existing patent .
Wellcome is seeking unspecified damages plus an injunction against the sale of Famvir , which was launched in the U.S. late last month .
In a statement , SmithKline denied any infringement of existing patents and said it would vigorously defend its position .
The legal skirmish escalates a high-stakes duel over the fast-growing , $ 800 million-a-year anti-herpes market that Wellcome has monopolized for years .
Zovirax is one of the world 's five biggest selling drugs and accounts for about a third of Wellcome 's annual revenue .
SmithKline 's Famvir is the first new medicine approved for treatment of shingles in more than a decade .
Over the past 18 months , the two British companies have bickered everywhere from scientific conferences and medical journals to sessions with securities analysts over the merits of their respective products .
Some of the sharpest exchanges concern sales results in the United Kingdom , the first market where Famvir and Zovirax have been in direct competition .
SmithKline claims a 25 % share of the U.K. shingles market for Famvir ; Wellcome claims the actual figure is closer to 5 % .
Yesterday , a SmithKline spokesman said Famvir has snagged 11.2 % of the $ 100 million-a-year U.S. shingles market since the drug 's launch July 22 .
Wellcome 's patent infringement suit claims that Zorivax and the active ingredient in Famvir are virtually identical molecules that belong to a class of compounds known as acyclic nucleosides covered by a Wellcome U.S. patent that expires in 1997 .
SmithKline officials counter that once activated inside the body Famvir and Zovirax have different characteristics .
The differences are apparent in dosage -- patients need to take Famvir only three times daily compared with five daily doses for Zovirax -- as well as duration , with Famvir effective for 11 hours compared with less than one hour for Zovirax .
SUNRISE MEDICAL Inc. -LRB- Torrance , Calif. -RRB- -- Larry C. Buckelew , 40-year-old president of this home health-care products maker , was named to the additional post of chief operating officer , a new position .

WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuter -RRB- -- A Saudi diplomat who defected to the U.S. in June has been granted political asylum , according to his attorneys , Leon and Michael Wildes of New York .
Mohammed al-Khilewi , formerly a senior diplomat at the Saudi mission to the United Nations , accused his country of human-rights abuses and asserted that the government tried secretly to get nuclear arms .
He also said his life had been threatened by Saudi officials .
The Saudi government has denied his allegations .
The State Department this month said it had n't any evidence to support Mr. Al-Khilewi 's allegations .
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials would n't confirm or deny the granting of asylum , calling it a private matter .
MCGRAW-HILL Inc. -LRB- New York -RRB- -- Barbara B. Maddock , 44 years old , was named senior vice president , human resources for this multimedia publishing and information-services company , a position which has been vacant since 1989 .

NEW YORK -- Yields on money-market funds rose in the latest week .
IBC\/Donoghue 's average seven-day compound yield on taxable funds increased to 4.11 % from 3.96 % , according Money Fund Report , an Ashland , Mass. , newsletter .
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends .
The seven-day simple yield on taxable funds rose to 4.03 % from 3.88 % .
The 30-day simple yield increased to 3.89 % from 3.83 % , while the 30-day compound yield climbed to 3.97 % from 3.91 % .
Total assets of 680 taxable funds -LRB- one less than the previous week -RRB- decreased by $ 5.64 billion , to $ 482.25 billion , in the week ended Tuesday according to Money Fund Report .
Institutional investors accounted for almost all of the outflow by taking $ 5.01 billion out , while individual investors took out the remaining $ 630 million .
Walter Frank , chief economist for Money Fund Report , said the outflow was a normal response to the recent raising of short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve .
While yields on direct money-market investments reflect Fed rate increases virtually instantaneously , money-fund yields rise more slowly .
This creates at least a temporary incentive for savvy money-fund investors to shift into Treasury bills and other short-term investments quickly when rates rise .
The average maturity of the taxable funds ' investments , which include commercial paper -LRB- short-term corporate IOUs -RRB- and Treasury bills , lengthened by two days , to 41 days .
The average seven-day compound yield on tax-exempt money funds increased to 2.48 % from 2.38 % in the week ended Tuesday , according to the newsletter .
The latest tax-free yield is equivalent to a taxable 3.88 % for someone paying 36 % in taxes and to 4.11 % for those who pay 39.6 % .
Total assets of 361 tax-exempt funds decreased by $ 161 million , to $ 113.14 billion , the newsletter said .
Average portfolio maturity of tax-free funds lengthened by one day to 55 days .

WASHINGTON -- Two Oklahoma congressmen will face each other in a race for a crucial Senate seat , while a Democratic House member who has been loyal to President Clinton faces a runoff within his own party .
In South Carolina , a Republican with close ties to the Christian Coalition won nomination for governor and will face the Democratic lieutenant governor .
In primary-election voting in Oklahoma on Tuesday , Democratic Rep. David McCurdy and Republican Rep. James Inhofe easily won their parties ' nominations to seek the Senate seat being vacated by retiring Democrat David Boren .
That seat is crucial to Republican hopes of winning control of the Senate in this fall 's congressional general elections .
Rep. Mike Synar , a Democratic House leader who has remained loyal to President Clinton , comfortably outpolled two Democratic challengers but did n't get the 50 % of the vote necessary to avoid a September runoff .
Mr. Synar , who got 47 % of the vote , will face a runoff against educator Virgil Cooper , who got 27 % .
Mr. Synar 's campaign was featured in a recent Wall Street Journal article .
In South Carolina , former state Rep. David Beasley , who has the support of many religious conservatives , beat retiring U.S. Rep. Arthur Ravenel for the Republican gubernatorial nomination 58 % -42 % .
Lt. Gov. Nick Theodore narrowly defeated Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley for the Democratic nomination .
Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell can not seek a third consecutive term .

HOUSTON -- Three leading brand names in hotels are competing for one of the biggest new properties in Texas in years : the planned 1,200-room George R. Brown Convention Center hotel .
Hilton Hotels Corp. , Hyatt Corp. and Marriott International Inc. all are interested in managing the hotel .
The big attraction : It would provide a solid footing in the Southwest convention market , and make the winner better able to refer business to and from other regions .
`` It 's going to be a horse race , '' says John M. Keeling , director of PKF Consulting , a hotel consulting firm in Houston .
The hotel is scheduled to open as early as 1997 , and the process of choosing a chain to run it is at an early stage .
Three developer groups interested in building it -- led by Duddlesten Cos. and Patrinely Group Inc. , both based in Houston , and JMB Realty Corp. , Chicago -- are negotiating with the prospective hotel operators .
By Feb. 18 , each must pick a chain as its partner and give the city a final proposal on financing , building and running the hotel , which the city hopes will bring life to the underused convention center .
The team chosen by city officials will receive tax subsidies totaling $ 40 million to $ 70 million over the first seven years .
The hotel will be owned by a nonprofit corporation , to be run by a board appointed by the mayor and city council .
The developer and operator , depending on details of the proposal , could share in profits .
Of the three hotel chains , Hilton -- which has been steadily losing market share in Texas since the oil bust -- may want the new business the most .
`` Hilton wants that hotel , '' says Mr. Keeling .
`` They need representation in Texas .
'' Hilton , based in Los Angeles , operates 16 hotels of more than 1,000 rooms nationwide , compared with 12 for Marriott , so it has an edge in marketing its name to conventions that move from year to year , says Peter Carlsen , a hotel consultant with Kenneth Leventhal & Co. in Houston .
But Marriott has a huge sales force that would probably be the most aggressive in seeking out meeting planners and luring them to Houston with incentives , says Thomas W. Lattin , a partner at Coopers & Lybrand in Dallas .
`` Marriott 's whole corporate culture is marketing , '' he says .
The Washington-based chain also has a slight edge in surveys of business-traveler satisfaction -- an asset that `` could help bring business to downtown Houston between conventions , '' Mr. Carlsen says .
Hyatt , based in Chicago , has seven hotels with more than 1,000 rooms .
It may be less attractive to city planners because it already has a hotel in downtown Houston , and adding another Hyatt is unlikely to draw more business travelers through brand loyalty , Mr. Carlsen says .
Both Hilton and Marriott say they will look at any proposal carefully before signing on .
`` We have to ask if there 's a good return on that investment , '' says Carl Motek , president of Hilton 's hotel division .
`` There are a lot of good hotels in the country losing money because somebody wanted to be there badly .
'' Hyatt officials did n't return calls seeking comment .
In the end , the winner may come down to one simple factor : money .
`` No hotel operator will walk into this building without expending substantial funds in the planning process , '' says Wayne Duddlesten , chairman of Duddlesten , which -- along with its two competitors -- filed an official statement earlier this month saying it plans to submit a proposal on the project .
Mr. Duddlesten says his team is negotiating with both Hilton and Marriott , and will choose `` whichever one is prepared to make the greatest commitment to the hotel in terms of brainpower , capital and overall initiative .
'' Mr. Keeling , the consultant , says the hotel operator might be expected to provide about $ 10 million for the estimated $ 160 million project .
The city estimates that the hotel will bring in revenue of $ 45 million in 1997 and $ 56 million in 2004 , but some people are skeptical .
`` If you look at the performance figures of downtown hotels in Houston , they stink , '' says Bruce Walker , president of Source Strategies Inc. , a San Antonio hotel-consulting firm .
`` And , if you look at the planned location of that one , it 's on the outskirts of town , in no-man 's land .
'' BOSTON -- Fidelity Investments holds about $ 400 million of bond-like guaranteed investment contract securities issued by Confederation Life Insurance Co. , a failed Canadian insurer , according to a person familiar with Fidelity .
Confederation issued about $ 2 billion in GICs .
The contracts ' principal and interest payments are `` guaranteed '' by issuing insurers .
But the guarantee is n't backed by any federal insurance .
Employees often buy GICs for retirement investing in 401 -LRB- k -RRB- savings plans and profit-sharing plans .
Fidelity and other investment managers hold GICs on behalf of clients ' `` defined contribution '' plans .
Confederation was seized this month by Canadian insurance regulators and is being liquidated .
The value of the company 's GICs are in doubt , although insurance-industry experts say investors eventually are expected to get their money back .
A Fidelity spokeswoman declined to comment on the investment manager 's holdings of Confederation 's GICs .
VALLEY FORGE , Pa. -- Alco Standard Corp. said it acquired Richard 's Office Supply Inc. of Taunton , Mass. .
Terms were n't disclosed .
Alco , which distributes paper and office equipment , said Richard 's Office Supply will become part of its A-Copy unit .
Combined annual revenue for fiscal 1994 is expected to exceed $ 134 million , it said .
TOKYO -- Mazda Motor Co. and Ford Motor Co. are considering a joint pickup-truck factory in Thailand , a move that would sharply expand cooperation between the allied auto makers .
Such a factory -- aimed at supplying the fast-growing Asian market -- would mark the first time the companies have built a plant together .
Ford owns 25 % of the Japanese car maker and in recent months has sent executives to Mazda 's headquarters in Hiroshima , a move analysts say is intended to help Mazda turn itself around after recording a 48.1 billion yen -LRB- $ 490.6 million -RRB- pretax loss in the year to March 1994 .
Officials declined to disclose the size , location or cost of the proposed plant .
Mazda officials said the feasibility study will be finished by early 1995 , with 1998 as a tentative production start-up date .
Mazda already produces about 24,000 cars in Thailand .
Separately , a Japanese car dealership affiliated with Nissan Motor Corp. signed an agreement to carry Ford cars , bringing the number of Ford outlets in Japan to 290 .
It is the latest sign of a renewed effort on the part of U.S. car makers to crack Japan 's domestic-car market .
ATLANTA -- Delta Air Lines will accept its pilots union 's offer to defer a 2 % pay raise , but the two sides will continue talks to cut costs .
The 8,500 Delta members of the Air Line Pilots Association were to receive the raise , totaling $ 26 million , at the end of August .
But the airline , in the midst of a restructuring to slash $ 2 billion in annual expenses , asked the pilots to forgo the increase .
Last year , the pilots rejected a request by Delta to give up a 5 % pay raise at a time when other Delta employees took a 5 % pay reduction .
This time , however , the union agreed but spelled out ways it hoped the company would use the savings .
One option would be to underwrite costs of new Delta jets to compete with low-cost carriers , a move that would require the recall of 36 furloughed pilots .
A second choice would be to reinstate the raise next year , depending on how negotiations on a new pilots contract are proceeding .
A Delta spokesman said the company still is looking at the pilots proposal .
Even as sports entrepreneur Bruce McNall negotiates with federal prosecutors in Los Angeles to plead guilty to felony fraud counts in connection with more than $ 100 million in bank borrowings , he and his defense team are working on a campaign to keep any jail time to a minimum .
Mr. McNall , part owner of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and a dealer in rare coins and antiquities , has reached a preliminary agreement with the U.S. attorney 's office to plead guilty to four counts , according to people familiar with the negotiations .
The counts relate to allegedly false financial information used to obtain loans from a number of banks .
Word of the tentative agreement , first reported in the Los Angeles Times yesterday , follows a guilty plea by a former controller of one of Mr. McNall 's companies on two criminal counts .
Those charges reflect what the U.S. attorney 's office termed a `` wide-ranging scheme to defraud financial institutions of over $ 138 million '' in loans by companies owned and controlled by Mr. McNall .
Representatives for Mr. McNall and the U.S. attorney declined to comment on the possibility of a plea agreement .
If Mr. McNall -- who became a local celebrity by buying the Kings in 1988 and bringing hockey legend Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles -- does plead guilty to multiple felony counts , he could face as much as nine years in federal prison , said one person familiar with the matter .
However , the businessman and his backers already are putting together arguments saying that all parties would best be served if the 44-year-old Mr. McNall received a much-reduced sentence or probation .
To make the case for a lenient sentence , according to people familiar with these efforts , Mr. McNall 's supporters will argue that he will be in a much better position to make restitution if he remains out of prison .
Though financial problems recently forced him to sell his controlling interest in the Kings , he is still president and part owner of the club .
He also has been working to build a new arena for the Kings and other local teams .
Mr. McNall is `` uniquely situated '' to help bring about the arena deal , one supporter said .
Mr. McNall 's defenders contend that through work on the arena and by continuing to help run the Kings , the entrepreneur could significantly improve his finances and be better able to pay off the banks .
A person close to Mr. McNall said he expects to remain with the Kings at least through the upcoming 1994-95 hockey season .
In Mr. McNall 's case for leniency , his representatives have assembled dozens of letters of support from his friends and business associates .
The supporters range from movie-studio heads and film stars to sports celebrities and religious leaders , said a person close to Mr. McNall .
This person declined to provide the names of any people who have written letters .
But Mr. McNall clearly has made a lot of famous friends in Los Angeles , ranging from actress Goldie Hawn to Walt Disney Co. .
Chairman Michael Eisner , whose company owns the Mighty Ducks hockey team in nearby Anaheim .
Mr. McNall stepped into the sports world after having become a powerful player in several sectors of the art market in the 1970s .
He amassed a huge collection of rare coins and one of the world 's most famous collections of sports memorabilia , along with substantial inventories of ancient art , particularly bronzes , and some rare stamps .
His lucrative strategy was to enter a market relatively well-capitalized and pay large and even record-setting prices -- sometimes with a partner -- for such notable objects as a mint-condition Honus Wagner baseball card -LRB- in 1991 for $ 451,000 -RRB- .
Then , he would fill out both his personal collection and his dealer 's inventory with groups of items purchased in large lots from rival dealers through low-ball offers .
Publicity from the prices he paid paved the way for relationships with wealthy collectors , and let his inventory benefit from the market booms that were created .
Still , said Chicago sports memorabilia dealer Michael Gidwitz , `` I do n't know anybody who ever made money through Bruce McNall except Bruce McNall .
'' Mr. Gidwitz described Mr. McNall as `` a guy who liked to ride the waves '' of the markets .
Mr. McNall became known in the coin field as adviser to the Dallas billionaire brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt in their acquisition of coins and ancient art .
Though a creditor-forced sale of the coin collection fetched a record $ 23 million at Sotheby 's in 1990 , the Hunts actually paid more for the coins , and their business relationship ended on bad terms .
Nelson Bunker Hunt declined to comment ; William Herbert Hunt could n't be reached to comment .
Mr. McNall parlayed his early relationship with the Hunts into business affiliations or deals with Merrill Lynch & Co. ; Los Angeles sports-memorabilia and stamp and coin seller Superior Galleries ; and others .
It also helped with his own firm , Numismatic Fine Arts International .
His business deals were frequently characterized by potential conflicts of interest rare in the art world .
People familiar with Mr. McNall 's finances say that a major continuing problem concerns some $ 90 million in loan guarantees he personally made on behalf of Gladden Entertainment , a local movie-production company in which he maintained an ownership interest .
Gladden was operated by longtime film executive David Begelman .
Mr. McNall filed for bankruptcy-court protection from creditors earlier this year .
In the current Los Angeles negotiations , how well Mr. McNall 's pitch for leniency will go over with prosecutors and the court remains to be seen , particularly in light of the apparent size and duration of the alleged fraud .
In a filing in the plea agreement with the former McNall controller , Joanna Orehek , the U.S. attorney 's office said the alleged fraud occurred as early as January 1990 .
Mr. McNall was n't named in the filing , which repeatedly referred to unidentified `` co-conspirators .
'' Among other things , Ms. Orehek and others were accused of overstating the income , assets and net worth of Mr. McNall and his various business entities while understating or omitting various liabilities .
Ms. Orehek 's attorney , William T. Graysen , said his client had been `` charmed '' by Mr. McNall as she moved up from a position of bookkeeper to become a vice president at one of his companies .
`` He really worked on her , so she finally got involved with these various fraud schemes , '' Mr. Graysen said .
He said she has been cooperating with prosecutors .
As for Mr. McNall 's personal art and collectibles holdings , coin and ancient art dealers are salivating over the bargains that may result if he is forced to liquidate his collections .
Dealers in sports memorabilia , though , worry that a flood of material on the already anemic market could only weaken it further .
A New York legal recruiting company has been sued by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly discriminating on the basis of age and national origin .
The lawsuit against Barrister Referrals Ltd. stems from an investigation begun last year by the New York office of the EEOC into the hiring practices of law firms .
The suit was filed in federal court in Manhattan .
New York attorney Joel Klarreich , who represents Barrister , said the company denies all allegations of discrimination .
The EEOC initially focused its investigation on legal-recruiting companies .
But the center of the agency 's concern is the hiring system at law firms , specifically the practice of hiring groups of young associates directly out of law school while allegedly not considering older lawyers .
EEOC regional attorney James Lee would n't say whether additional suits are expected .
BORG-WARNER AUTOMOTIVE Inc. -LRB- Chicago -RRB- -- This maker of automotive parts said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission documents for an offering , by certain stockholders , of three million existing common shares .
The company noted that it wo n't receive any proceeds from the holders ' planned sale of the 13 % stake .
The shares to be sold are primarily in the hands of investors who participated in the 1987 leveraged buyout of what was then known as Borg-Warner Corp. .
Borg-Warner Automotive went public a year ago at $ 25 a share , an initial offering of 3.7 million new shares .
Merrill Lynch will lead the underwriters of the planned offering .
Yesterday , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Borg-Warner Automotive shares slipped 75 cents to $ 26.375 .
FISHKILL , N.Y. -- Recipe for a turnaround : Slash employment by 40 % , close plants , move to a modern production process and refocus to serve a fast-growing global market instead of captive internal customers .
Michael J. Attardo has done just that at IBM Microelectronics in two years .
He has transformed the $ 5-billion-a-year chip-making division , once a lead weight on struggling International Business Machines Corp. .
The operation was losing several hundred million dollars a year and now earns that much , a person close to the company says .
But what a choice for an encore .
Instead of focusing on relatively sure bets in the chip business , Mr. Attardo , the unit 's general manager , is taking on industry giant Intel Corp. .
Once the two companies were seemingly inseparable partners ; IBM even owned a substantial stake in Intel in the mid-1980s .
Now IBM Microelectronics , through its own internal efforts and alliances with small chip designers , is preparing perhaps the most serious challenge yet to Intel 's dominance of the $ 7 billion microprocessor business .
Armonk , N.Y.-based IBM says its once-captive chip business will sell more than $ 1 billion of myriad types of chips to outside rivals this year , up from $ 700 million last year and almost nothing in 1991 .
Now Mr. Attardo plans to blanket the market with microprocessors , the highly profitable `` brains '' of personal computers , by making Intel `` clones '' as well as a new design , the much-vaunted PowerPC .
If IBM succeeds , it could eat into a sizable chunk of Intel revenue .
The competition would translate into cheaper PCs for consumers .
`` IBM Microelectronics is certainly poised to be one of Intel 's biggest competitors , '' says Michael Slater , publisher of the industry newsletter Microprocessor Report .
`` If everything goes well they could sell millions of chips .
'' But IBM faces some high hurdles .
Intel , based in Santa Clara , Calif. , already plans to slash prices as much as 40 % this year , which could blunt IBM 's effort .
An earlier IBM foray into Intel 's design had limited success .
Big Blue also must contend with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , an Intel-clone maker that has signed up some big customers , including Compaq Computer Corp. .
Intel must strike a delicate balance in dealing with IBM , whose PC unit is one of Intel 's largest customers .
Intel believes it can beat IBM in producing low-cost chips because its plants are larger and specialize in one chip line , while IBM builds five kinds or more on its fabrication lines .
An Intel spokesman also points out the difficulties IBM faces as it moves from a `` captive '' chip maker serving other IBM divisions to one able to compete profitably on the open market .
In addition , while IBM has closed some plants , Intel is expanding aggressively .
One new plant went on line , two more are under construction , two major expansions are in the works , and yet another new factory has just been proposed , all at a total combined cost of more than $ 6 billion .
One Intel insider dismissed IBM 's capacity : `` It 's a blip .
'' IBM 's Mr. Attardo counters that while `` Intel is a rich and innovative company , ... it makes us run faster .
We 'll give them a horse race .
'' His timing may be right .
Major PC makers are increasingly willing to consider non-Intel chips , squeezed by price cuts and declining profit margins .
Compaq and others have begun using cheaper Intel clones in some models .
A big reason is that the microprocessor accounts for about one-quarter of a PC 's cost .
In addition , the industry is short on advanced chip-making capacity at a time when IBM has too much .
Its decision to move mainframes and minicomputers to smaller chip designs has freed up more capacity by allowing IBM to make far more devices on each silicon `` wafer .
'' So would-be Intel challengers , many of them lacking their own chip plants , have come knocking on IBM 's door .
Since April , IBM has disclosed pacts to make clones of Intel 's top-of-the-line Pentium chip with two upstart chip-design companies , Cyrix Corp. and NexGen Inc. .
Both chips are scheduled to be shipped by year 's end .
More such agreements may be on the way , IBM watchers say .
Under the Cyrix pact , IBM Microelectronics may sell to PC makers , including its own PC unit , one IBM-labeled Cyrix chip for every chip it makes for Cyrix .
An undisclosed portion of the NexGen agreement gives IBM the right to resell some NexGen-designed chips under its own label as well , industry executives say .
Cyrix already has signed up AST Research Corp. , the fifth-largest U.S. PC maker , as well as Groupe Bull SA 's Zenith Data Systems , Epson America Inc. , and several smaller makers .
IBM 's Mr. Attardo says his unit also is talking with many PC makers about using the Cyrix and NexGen chips .
Compaq , which owns part of NexGen , is believed to be considering both , as is IBM 's own PC operation .
Many computer makers say they will buy non-Intel chips if they provide better performance for the money or fill a niche Intel leaves unfilled .
`` We ` re very open to looking at different processors , '' says Charlie Loarridge , a Zenith Data vice president .
For IBM , however , churning out Intel clones is a strategy to keep IBM 's chip plants humming until the PowerPC takes off , Mr. Attardo says .
PowerPC chips already appear in Apple 's newest models .
But they are n't expected in products from IBM , Zenith and others until the end of the year .
The speedy chips ca n't yet run programs designed for Microsoft Corp. 's Windows system , which runs on Intel-based systems and dominates the market , except through a process called emulation .
That slows down the programs and blunts the speed advantages that PowerPC can offer .
Despite these shortcomings , Mr. Attardo says IBM will concentrate its chip-making ability on PowerPC .
Faster versions are in the pipeline , and IBM is working on a model with circuitry mimicking Intel chips , which should allow it to run Windows software more readily .
Intel , not to be outdone , recently joined with Hewlett-Packard Co. to incorporate features from HP 's RISC chips into Intel 's line , though the effort will take years .
It also could cut prices even more quickly than planned , or step up the introduction of new models .
And Intel has asked a judge to rule on whether IBM has the right to make Cyrix 's chips .
Cyrix and IBM say this falls within an existing Intel-IBM contract that allows IBM to make Intel chips for its own PCs .
Intel disagrees .
Mr. Attardo of IBM professes to be unfazed by Intel 's moves .
He says his operation is moving fast to become a force in the semiconductor business .
`` We 'll be competitive with Intel , '' he vows .
At the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo this year , some lucky visitors were treated to more than the usual dances , cocktail parties and tours of local ranches .
Diplomats from China , France and elsewhere also got an earful from the Texas Department of Agriculture about their countries ' restrictions on imports of Texas cattle because of bluetongue virus .
The virus infects many animals in the Southern U.S. but almost never causes health problems , officials say .
Where better to lobby on bluetongue than the festive setting of the rodeo ?
`` It 's a relaxed environment that brings people of like minds together , '' says Mark Ellison , Texas ' assistant agriculture commissioner .
`` This is a good time to try to undo some prejudices .
'' In the rodeo 's `` international room , '' Mr. Ellison handed visitors copies of a 17-page essay that argues for easing restrictions on cattle imports from bluetongue areas .
The essay , by a Texas A&M University professor , argues not only that the virus is usually harmless to cattle , but also that it spreads only through certain kinds of gnats -- which many countries do n't have .
Texas does a thriving cattle business with Thailand , the Philippines and Mexico , but loses millions of dollars a year in sales to other countries that wo n't import cattle from bluetongue areas , Mr. Ellison says .
Texas breeders say the virus is an excuse for protectionism .
`` It 's a political disease , and it makes my blood boil , '' says Orvan Muelker , a breeder from Cost , Texas .
The result of the lobbying was mixed .
The French and Chinese consuls listened politely and agreed to keep the dialogue open .
But Russia , which wants to start breeding beef cattle near Moscow , seemed ready to talk business .
After gobbling up ice cream during a tour of the Blue Bell creamery in Brenham , a Russian official told her hosts she will look into what her country 's rules are , and whether they need changing to do business with Texas breeders .
`` It seemed to go well , '' Mr. Ellison said .
`` But we did n't want to push too hard at the first meeting .
'' The National Weather Service is predicting storms over the Florida Straits this weekend .
Winds could be as strong as 30 miles an hour , with waves of up to 10 feet , meaning almost certain death for refugees attempting the 90-mile journey from Havana to Miami .
Yet many Cubans have already proved themselves just that desperate ; in the past week alone , some 10,000 have been willing to risk sharks and uncertain weather on a few bits of lumber lashed to some worn-out tires ; we do not know how many have perished in the attempt .
The refugees who are currently flooding our shores are not the first to have risked everything to reach America .
The history of this country is in no small measure the history of refugees ; more than any other nation , the United States has welcomed the desperate and the destitute .
This history makes even more difficult the moral dilemma of how the U.S. should respond to the exodus from Cuba -- or , for that matter , from Haiti .
To turn them back is to turn our backs on our history .
And yet if we let them in , we open the door not only to unacceptable social dislocations at home , but also to the rest of the world 's refugees , all of whom place the U.S. on the top of their lists of where they want to settle .
President Clinton 's solution is to deny asylum to new Cuban refugees and lock them up at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay .
This may have worked with the Haitian refugees , at least temporarily , but eventually the camps will overflow .
In both cases , our means of dealing with unacceptable governments is to add to the woes of the people they oppress , denying them aid from relatives in America and denying them the chance to flee .
With all due recognition of the very deep dilemmas policy-makers face , this policy does not seem sustainable either practically or morally .
The best way to stop Cubans from fleeing to America is to make them want to stay in Cuba .
Toward that end , the guiding principle in formulating U.S. policy ought to be how we can best help Cuba 's people liberate themselves from the dictatorship that has brought their country to ruin .
The way to do that , we have slowly come to believe , is to lift the embargo .
In saying this we yield to no one as an opponent of Communist dictatorships .
We understand that many of Castro 's most fervent opponents believe this is no time to lessen his troubles .
Fidel himself apparently buys into this argument , given his suggestion Wednesday that Cuba and the U.S. open talks on ending the 28-year-old economic blockade .
He also suggests that Cuba 's discontent is caused by the embargo rather than by his own bumbling and oppressive socialism .
But with the loss of his Soviet sugar daddy in 1989 , his days in any event seem numbered , a circumstance that suggests easing the plight of his island full of prisoners .
We suspect the time has arrived , indeed , when lifting the embargo would help precisely those forces that are most likely to liberalize Cuba 's economic and political power structure .
This is precisely what is happening in China , where trade is encouraging entrepreneurs to break free of the state ; Castro is in a far more precarious position .
Indeed , the process seems already working in Cuba itself since the U.S. dollar and many small enterprises were legalized last summer .
The Cuban peso is used for little more than a food stamp , transportation chit and housing voucher and is being traded for dollars on the black market at a fraction of its official value .
Visitors to Cuba report a new openness and willingness to criticize the government .
In lifting the embargo , however , there is no need to give Castro any `` face .
'' No U.S. officials have to dignify Castro 's regime by sitting down at a negotiating table with Cuban officials , and the U.S. should continue to oppose any government-to-government aid by American or multilateral agencies .
The whole point is to continue to oppose Castro 's government while allowing succor for Cuba 's people .
Such steps might not end the flow of refugees overnight , but if the torrent slowed , the U.S. could gradually find ways to be more generous .
Ending the embargo would at least offer a ray of hope .
We should declare that we are lifting the embargo not as a concession to Castro but as a way to speed his departure .

TORONTO -- Hollinger Inc. posted a 34 % rise in second-quarter profit , excluding special items , despite a newspaper price war in Britain .
Helped by gains in other operations , Hollinger 's net income rose to 96.6 million Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 70.4 million -RRB- , or C$ 1.67 -LRB- US$ 1.22 -RRB- a share , compared with C$ 10.9 million , or 16 Canadian cents a share , a year earlier .
Revenue rose 54 % to C$ 350.5 million from C$ 227.7 million .
The most recent results included a gain of C$ 82 million , or C$ 1.44 a share , from unusual items which the company did n't identify .
Hollinger officials could n't be reached for comment .
In the U.K. , Hollinger 's Telegraph PLC unit cut the price of its Daily Telegraph newspaper just eight days before the end of the second quarter .
Its London rival , News Corp. 's Times , had slashed its price last September .
Hollinger 's second-quarter profit from the U.K. fell to C$ 26 million from C$ 35.8 million a year earlier , Hollinger said , but the decline was `` more than offset by general improvements from most other operations with a major contribution coming from the Sun-Times Co. '' Hollinger 's American Publishing Co. unit bought the Chicago-based Sun-Times in March .
The price war was `` not a disaster '' for Hollinger , said Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Lauren Rich Fine , adding that the effects will likely be offset in the second half by earnings at the Sun-Times and income from its 25 % stake in John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. in Australia and 19 % holding in Canada 's Southam Inc. .
Hollinger stock rose 4.063 U.S. cents in Nasdaq Stock Market trading to US$ 10 .
On the Toronto Stock Exchange , it rose 12.5 Canadian cents to C$ 13.75 .
From a giant aluminum company in Pittsburgh to a small can company in Massachusetts , retirement-plan officials are grappling with the collapse of Confederation Life Insurance Co. of Toronto .
Aluminum Co. of America said it has frozen the 7.7 % of assets in its Alcoa Savings Plan Fixed Income Fund represented by Confederation Life guaranteed investment contracts .
This fund is an option employees can select in Alcoa 's 401 -LRB- k -RRB- retirement-savings plan .
Alcoa has told employees that `` you ca n't withdraw it or transfer it or take loans on '' that 7.7 % portion of the fund , said a spokesman for the Pittsburgh company .
`` The remainder of the fund is free to normal savings-plan transactions .
'' Fidelity Investments , Boston , is the manager for the fund .
Confederation previously said it had suspended making principal and interest payments on its GICs .
In the U.S. , it has issued a total of $ 2 billion in GIC-bond-like instruments issued by life insurers that are often found in self-managed retirement plans .
The insurer `` guarantees '' principal and interest payments , but there is n't any federal insurance .
Confederation Life is being liquidated by Canadian insurance regulators , who seized it earlier this month .
Regulators in Michigan and Georgia are trying to rehabilitate the U.S. business , which has assets of about $ 7.3 billion .
Sexton Can Co. , in Cambridge , Mass. , said all of the `` several million dollars '' in the GIC account of its retirement plan are in Confederation GICs .
When Sexton terminated its previous pension plan in 1990 , it put most of that sum into the GIC fund .
`` I have heard that there will probably be a reduction in the amount of interest '' paid on the Confederation GICs , said Paul Goguen , executive vice president of Sexton .
Mr. Goguen said employees who retire , or beneficiaries of employees who die , should be able to withdraw money from the GIC fund , according to communications from Confederation 's U.S. headquarters in Atlanta .
But for now , current employees ca n't transfer money out of the GIC fund into another retirement fund , or pull out money because they quit the company .
While Mr. Goguen said he 's beginning `` to feel optimistic '' that Sexton employees will receive back their principal from the GIC fund , he added , `` It was , believe me , a shock '' to hear that Confederation had been seized by regulators .
He said that Confederation received top credit ratings five years ago `` when we evaluated this .
'' A subsidiary of Confederation manages Sexton 's defined benefit plan funds ; the company 's balanced and equity funds , which are invested in bonds and stocks , are n't affected by Confederation 's collapse .
There 's not much employees can do right now if they 're in a Confederation GIC .
The best preventive medicine , said Tama McAleese , a financial planner in Wellington , Ohio , is to remember that `` there are no safe investments ; diversification is the only method of managing those risks inherent in any type of investment .
'' Confederation continues to pay interest on its individual and group annuities , according to a statement from the Michigan insurance commissioner .
Group annuities are often set up by companies for their employees as a retirement benefit .
Confederation also has a smaller amount of annuities issued in Canada and the United Kingdom .
Fidelity Investments said it has sold customers 420 annuity contracts , with $ 27.8 million in premiums , since 1991 .
`` We are basically telling people what the Michigan regulators are telling people -- that all annuity payments will continue to be made by the U.S. subsidiary , '' a Fidelity spokeswoman said .
Asked if Fidelity would make good on any shortfall in the annuities it has sold , she said , `` It 's way too soon to speculate about that .
'' In other developments , Great-West Life Assurance Co. said it acquired the U.S. group insurance business of Confederation .
Terms of the transaction were n't disclosed .
The move ends the uncertainty for about 400,000 employees at 750 companies as to the extent their group life insurance policies were still covered .
But observers do n't expect the sale will be much help to Confederation 's overall prospects .
`` In dollar terms it 's not meaningful .
But it shows that the rehabilitators are moving quickly to look at proposals to buy parts of the company , '' said Fred Townsend , an insurance consultant at Townsend & Schupp , Hartford , Conn. .
Confederation 's group insurance business , including the administration of corporate self-insurance programs , had a loss of $ 6.7 million last year on revenue of $ 115.6 million , which represents just 7 % of total U.S. revenue .
Under terms of the deal , Great-West will assume responsibility for all claims filed as of Sept. 1 .
Great-West , of Winnipeg , Manitoba , is a unit of Power Corp. of Canada , controlled by Montreal financier Paul Desmarais .
Peat Marwick Thorne Inc. , Confederation 's Canadian liquidator , which last week announced an agreement to sell the company 's profitable British subsidiary , currently is reviewing bids for Confederation 's big Canadian group life and health insurance business .
Separately , Peat Marwick Thorne announced layoffs of nearly 10 % of Confederation 's Canadian work force , mainly in the company 's administration and marketing areas .
Confederation will have 1,700 employees in Canada after the cuts ; half of these work in the group insurance business that is up for sale .

WASHINGTON -- Health reform , which a year ago appeared certain to be shaped by a single , sweeping piece of legislation , now is likely to be forged in a marketplace tussle between cost-minded purchasers and rapidly merging providers .
Yesterday , Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell , who had threatened to keep lawmakers in session until health-care legislation was approved , said he will send his colleagues home for Labor Day without even voting on essential provisions of a bill .
Sen. Mitchell vowed to keep negotiating with a rump group of lawmakers and staffers and to reconvene the Senate in two weeks .
But his decision to let the senators go home is widely seen as an acknowledgment that the kind of major health-care overhaul envisioned by both President Clinton and Mr. Mitchell is unlikely this year .
That 's because elections are looming and both sides on the health issue are still far apart .
The latest setback for broad health-care legislation reflects an inability to muster a legislative majority for any single approach .
In recent weeks , various short-lived compromise proposals have been floated in Congress .
But they have collapsed quickly -- generally amid disagreement about how to pay for reform , how big a role the government should play and how quickly or slowly Congress should press for universal coverage .
Even without a major bill this year , however , the U.S. health system will see extensive change .
A flurry of mergers is creating some giant medical combines that promise efficiency but also alarm competitors and some consumers .
Meanwhile , without government prompting , employers and insurers are nudging workers into health-maintenance organizations .
Those health plans offer lower-cost , more-efficient care , in return for limits on patient choice .
Many of those changes parallel the types of sweeping reorganization sought last year in President Clinton 's original health-care initiative .
But that 1,342-page bill ran into heavy criticism for being too bureaucratic and too regulatory .
Executives at major hospital chains and HMOs say they can achieve one of the president 's main goals -- cost containment -- without government involvement .
`` The system is finally correcting itself , '' says David Colby , chief financial officer of Columbia\/HCA Healthcare Corp. in Louisville , Ky. `` You 're getting prudent buyers coming into health care .
That did n't used to be the case 10 years ago .
'' Columbia , which runs more than 190 hospitals , has grown rapidly in the past year by acquisition .
It says that many of its costs have declined this year , after years of medical price increases that greatly exceeded general inflation .
Because of its hefty market share in states such as Florida , Texas and Tennessee , Columbia says it can negotiate cheaper rates from a range of suppliers , and then use those savings to win business from big corporations that need health care for workers .
Meanwhile , total membership in HMOs is likely to reach 50 million this year , up 10 % from a year earlier , predicts Kenneth Abramowitz , a health analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York .
He estimates that HMOs could cover 45 % of the privately insured U.S. population by the year 2000 , up from 26 % last year .
HMOs `` have a spectacular grip on costs , '' Mr. Abramowitz says .
Because they channel patients to the doctors and hospitals deemed most cost-effective , their costs often are at least 20 % below those of standard indemnity insurers .
That makes HMOs an increasingly compelling choice for employers trying to decide how to provide medical coverage for employees .
Market-led health reform , however , is n't likely to benefit the uninsured , who now total 39 million , up from 35 million in 1989 , according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute , a private , nonprofit group in Washington .
If there is n't any legislation making health insurance easier to obtain , the institute predicts , the number of uninsured could top 45 million by the turn of the century .
`` Those people outside the system will definitely be hurt the most '' by the collapse of efforts to pass a comprehensive health-care bill since they wo n't be helped by market innovation , says Deborah Steelman , a former Reagan administration official who now lobbies for pharmaceutical companies and other medical-industry clients .
`` They wo n't be given access to insurance , which does n't mean they wo n't be given access to care , but it is n't something that you or I would choose for ourselves .
'' With legislation granting universal coverage all but dead , lawmakers may still be able to enact a modest bill this year that aims to expand coverage by offering subsidies to poor people and revising insurance-market rules to make it easier and cheaper for people to obtain coverage .
But such a scaled-back approach faces significant opposition from liberals , who are reluctant to settle for incremental steps , as well as from conservatives who worry about funding the subsidy program .
Moreover , it is unclear whether President Clinton would sign such a bill , since he has frequently said such an approach would n't work .
Small business , which campaigned relentlessly against Democrats ' proposals to finance health reform with an `` employer mandate , '' may find that it lobbied quite well .
Small-business opposition is often cited as a major reason for the collapse of the White House 's ambitious reform agenda .
So , small companies that want to provide health insurance must contend with what may be an unfriendly market .
Unless small companies can combine into large buying pools , they will lack buying clout and may end up paying more for coverage .
`` The health-care situation of our members will worsen with no reform bill , '' says Jack Faris , president of the National Federation of Independent Business , a Washington lobbying group .
Many big companies , however , regard market forces as the elixir that will help them subdue feverishly escalating health costs .
During the 12 months ended July 31 , medical prices in the consumer price index rose 4.6 % .
If that rate remains steady for all of 1994 , it will mark the smallest rise in medical prices in more than two decades .
In Palo Alto , Calif. , Hewlett-Packard Co. expects even smaller increases -- 1 % or less -- in its medical rates for 1995 .
Because of fierce competition among HMOs in Northern California , Hewlett-Packard says it has received bids for health coverage next year that in some cases amount to price cuts of as much as 15 % .
`` Where we have a competitive market , it 's really working , '' says Art Young , benefits manager .
He says the computer maker began looking for ways to save on medical costs well before the Clinton reform drive went into high gear .
`` But if we had thought there really was going to be a federal program , '' Mr. Young adds , `` we probably would n't have put as much energy into cost containment .
'' Even one of the companies that had most vocally supported a health-care-system overhaul , Chrysler Corp. , says it has been relying on private-sector initiatives to hold down medical costs .
`` A majority of Chrysler employees are now in managed care , '' says Walter Maher , director of federal relations for the auto maker .
In areas such as substance abuse and mental health , he adds , Chrysler is saving money by relying exclusively on preferred-provider networks , which encourage patients to use a limited number of doctors at discount rates .
For doctors , hospitals and drug companies , a market-driven reform process is sure to bring many battles over prices and customers .
Physicians are most concerned about how they may fare .
But other providers think they can prevail and even thrive , sometimes by jumping into new lines of business .
Among pharmaceutical makers , for example , Eli Lilly & Co. estimates that its average selling prices will drop 2 % this year , as big customers press for discounts .
By contrast , Lilly 's average prices rose 0.6 % last year , climbed 5.2 % in 1992 , and jumped 7 % in 1991 .
But Lilly says it does n't fear price-cutting , in large part because it is about to acquire a major prescription-drug benefit-management company , PCS , which contracts with large companies to hold down employees ' prescription costs .
Many hospitals , meanwhile , are looking for ways to get access to a broader pool of patients , either by buying primary-care medical practices , by merging with other hospitals or by setting up their own HMOs .
In Ohio , Akron City Hospital has set up a new HMO , SummaCare , as a way to keep existing patients loyal and to attract new ones .
Even some physicians are part of the trend , with some setting up large , integrated medical-service companies .
Doctors in Jackson , Miss. , for instance , formed their own HMO earlier this year .
And Mullikin Medical Centers , a 400-doctor group practice in Artesia , Calif. , negotiated earlier this month to buy a 280-physician group practice in Oregon .
Such transactions give doctors more clout in negotiating their own managed-care contracts .
But some physicians fear that health-industry giants with insurance funding may come to dominate their lives .
James Todd , executive vice president of the American Medical Association , says : `` Our real concern is that if nothing happens in Washington , the rapid consolidation of health delivery by megacorporations will place patients in jeopardy .
'' Dr. Todd says the AMA would like to see legislation that limits an insurer 's ability to deal only with a select group of doctors , thereby making it hard for other physicians to see patients .
Recently , there have been signs of a slowdown in the rises in doctors ' incomes , a bellwether for the prosperity of the medical sector .
The AMA reported that doctors earned a median $ 177,400 in 1992 , the most recent year for which data are available .
That was up about 4 % from the previous year , barely ahead of inflation .
A number of economists from across the political spectrum , however , are wary of the health-care market 's ability to solve the cost problem for good .
Robert Reischauer , director of the Congressional Budget Office , takes issue with the claim that market forces have helped `` turn the corner '' on medical inflation .
More likely , he says , market competition is merely providing a `` little bit of rest '' from spiraling health-care prices .
`` There 's been a slight dip , but if you look at the long-term trends -- the aging of the population , the demand for medical services and the technology -- you will find a continuing cost increase , '' says Robert Moffit , deputy director of domestic-policy studies at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank in Washington .
`` The reason , many economists feel , is the market is fundamentally broken .
'' Jack Rodgers , director of health-policy economics at Price Waterhouse , sees two conflicting forces at work .
`` On the one hand there are a lot of market changes going on , '' he says .
`` On the other side , however , there 's a fundamental problem : The number of uninsured is increasing faster than the population .
'' The battle over health reform has become so drawn out and bitter that many observers feel that both Congress and the president will be reluctant to return to it next year .
But administration officials say they will try again -- even though the forces working against a major bill may be even worse .
Congress will probably be more polarized , as Republicans are expected to pick up a number of seats in November 's elections .
Moreover , in 1995 the presidential politics that influenced the hard-line position of would-be candidate Bob Dole , the Senate GOP leader , will be even more heated .
Larry Atkins , former Senate Republican staffer and now coordinator for the Corporate Healthcare Coalition , a lobbying group that includes Fortune 500 companies , thinks state action will lead to pressure for Congress to come back to health-care reform in the next year or two .
States , which have been waiting for Washington to act , will now be more aggressive in seeking exemptions from the federal law that limits their ability to tax and set mandates for large , multistate corporate health plans .
`` The states will force the issue next year , '' Mr. Atkins predicts .
But a number of federal lawmakers may also push early next year for a more modest bill that includes some of the popular insurance-market revisions that both Democrats and Republicans agree on , including limiting insurers ' ability to deny coverage for `` pre-existing '' medical conditions .
The unraveling of federal health-reform efforts is unsettling for a few large companies with heavy retiree-health obligations , such as Bethlehem Steel Corp. .
The Pennsylvania steelmaker was an early champion of the Clinton plan and says it still favors `` comprehensive health reform .
'' In recent years , Bethlehem has made heavy use of managed-care programs and has even set up its own clinic to treat workers and retirees .
Such steps `` help modestly , but they do n't go to the big problems , '' says Ben Boylston , Bethlehem 's vice president for human resources .
Academic medical centers , meanwhile , express concern that as cost-minded health plans proliferate , it may be increasingly hard to set aside money for research and training of young doctors .
Robert Smoldt , secretary to the board of governors at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn. , asks : `` Without federal legislation , will managed-care plans be willing to pay for contributions from academic centers ?
That is an area of concern for us .
'' But many health-industry executives would rather reshape their industry without government help .
`` No reform is better than bad reform , '' says David Simon , general counsel for U.S. Healthcare Corp. , a Blue Bell , Pa. , HMO .
`` It makes no sense for Congress to hurry this process and interfere with the revolution that 's going on in the marketplace .

Richard Frank is one Hollywood television executive who got on-the-job training in the broadcasting side of the business , so he understands the needs and wants of station executives .
Mr. Frank , 51 years old , is the chairman of the newly created Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications unit ; he had previously been responsible for television under Jeffrey Katzenberg at the Walt Disney Studios .
Mr. Frank is called a consummate salesman by colleagues ; he had to be when he came to Disney in 1985 from the presidency of the Paramount Television Group .
From a crawling start , Disney has become one of the nation 's top providers of programming , with 40 hours on the air each week including the top-rated `` Home Improvement .
'' The Disney Channel , with eight million subscribers , is the fastest-growing premium cable network in the U.S. Mr. Frank started in local-broadcast advertising sales and marketing and later was general manager of a Los Angeles independent TV station .
At Disney , he took the risky path of spending big money to attract successful producers and writers -- and hit the jackpot .
Mr. Frank , who is also president of the Emmy-award bestower Academy of Television Arts and Sciences , says it 's smart to separate movie and TV\/telecommunications into units .
`` Ten years ago , having them together made sense , but the businesses are really very different today , '' he says .
So is the nature of Mr. Frank 's job .
`` I just looked at my calendar for the last two weeks and the same period a year ago , '' he says .
`` Then , I was sitting through a run-through of ` Home Improvement ' and worrying about renewal for ` Regis and Kathie Lee .
' The last couple of weeks we 've done a deal with three major telephone companies , announced a family channel in Germany and purchased satellite transponder time in India .
'' In naming Joe Roth to head its revamped Walt Disney Motion Pictures unit , Walt Disney Co. made both an obvious and popular choice .
It will also be , in Hollywood terms , a cheap move -- from across the lot rather than across town .
In November 1992 , Mr. Roth departed as chairman of the Twentieth Century Fox film unit of News Corp. to set up an independent production company , Caravan Pictures , at Disney .
Prior to that , he was a hands-on producer and director at independent Morgan Creek Productions , successfully maneuvering the small firm through an obstacle course that tripped up many other independents .
At Fox , he made deals with high-grossing producers , sliced overhead and strengthened international distribution .
His overall record was mixed .
He was responsible for the Bette Midler dud `` For the Boys '' and Robin Williams 's `` Toys .
'' But he will long be remembered for snatching filmmaker John Hughes 's `` Home Alone '' after it was cut loose by a rival studio ; the movie became the most successful comedy of all time .
Mr. Roth is well thought of by others in Hollywood because of his experiences as a filmmaker : He knows how to attract talented directors , writers and actors .
Some say , however , that as an executive he can be short-tempered with colleagues .
The 46-year-old Mr. Roth , on leaving Fox , said he did n't enjoy supervising a large staff and having lots of staff meetings and would never take on a studio job again .
`` Never is a long time , '' he now says .
`` I 've been missing many of the different kinds of things that you do when running a studio , like marketing and distribution .
'' Mr. Roth wo n't be in charge of television or animated films .
Referring to Jeffrey Katzenberg , Mr. Roth says , `` I 'm grateful I do n't have to fill Jeffrey 's shoes .
But I realized that I missed the strategizing and , frankly , being in a leadership role in a company .
'' WASHINGTON -- The Agriculture Department said it has perfected a fast , scientific method for detecting possibly harmful bacteria on meat going through commercial processing plants .
The new , five-minute `` microbial '' test will enable inspectors to do a better job of determining when beef , pork and poultry carcasses have toxic bacteria , officials said , and will help inspectors to act quickly to correct a problem .
The department has said for many months that such a test was in the works .
Currently , inspectors must rely on less-effective visual detection of fecal contamination on meat carcasses -- or on so-called biologic detection , which involves analysis of plate cultures after 48 hours .
But meat has long passed through a slaughterhouse 's processing line before the results of a biologic test are available .
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy said he told his department 's Food Safety and Inspection Service and its Agricultural Research Service to work up a plan for using the new test method in regular meat inspections .
Michael Taylor , the new administrator of the inspection service , promised rule-making that could lead in a year to a requirement to use the new test .
Officials said the test has been tried in 12 commercial processing plants and on more than 1,800 beef , pork and poultry carcasses .
Mr. Espy 's announcement comes as he is under fire for letting outside interests pay for personal trips and tickets to sporting events .
Attorney General Janet Reno early this month asked a federal appeals court here to name an independent counsel to investigate charges that Mr. Espy illegally accepted gifts from poultry giant Tyson Foods Inc. and others with business before the department .
This week it was disclosed that Mr. Espy charged the government $ 849 for a trip to the Super Bowl in January , where his department 's Smokey the Bear was honored in two half-time videos .
An Atlanta museum that is promoting Smokey 's 50th birthday paid $ 900 for four game tickets that it gave the secretary .
At a news conference called to announce the new meat-testing approach , Mr. Espy refused to answer a question about the Super Bowl tickets , saying the briefing was on a `` technical '' issue .
According to Reuters news service , he told reporters after the session that the report about the Super Bowl trip `` is replete with inaccuracies '' and that after an independent counsel is named , `` I will begin to answer and tell and speak and refute '' the allegations .
The new , rapid-test method is n't yet capable of singling out specific pathogens such as salmonella or E. coli , which are produced by fecal contamination and can be deadly for consumers .
But Mr. Espy said that if his department had n't moved ahead with yesterday 's announcement , `` there could be another accusation '' that it was dragging its heels .
Critics have said that the department has gone slower on `` zero tolerance '' for poultry fecal contamination than it has for other meat .
The secretary said that when he took office , existing rules for red-meat contamination were n't being enforced and rules for poultry had n't even been developed .
As for the new test , officials said that by detecting high levels of any bacterium , the test will enable inspectors to take steps to reduce bacteria -- harmful or otherwise -- from meat on processing lines .
The test involves swabbing part of all of the meat carcass with a sponge , removing the bacteria from the sponge and then analyzing the amount of those bacteria .
The new meat-inspection test adapts technology that the beer and pharmaceutical industries are already using to detect bacterial contamination on processing equipment .
KUALA LUMPUR , Malaysia -- Malaysian Airline System Bhd. 's new chairman and largest shareholder , Datuk Tajudin Ramli , said the flag carrier is in a tailspin .
In his first meeting with reporters since being named chairman earlier this month , Mr. Datuk Tajudin warned `` if we do n't change , the same fate could happen to us as happened at Pan Am , '' the defunct U.S. airline .
`` It 's that serious .
'' Industry officials and analysts have known about the airline 's deepening woes for some time , which only added to their puzzlement when Mr. Datuk Tajudin agreed in June to pay a 60 % premium above the then prevailing market price to acquire a controlling 32 % stake in the airline for 1.79 billion ringgit -LRB- $ 702.7 million -RRB- .
What the analysts do n't know , however , is how the former merchant banker intends to correct MAS 's nose dive .
Neither is a new strategy clear , apparently , to Mr. Datuk Tajudin .
`` But , '' he said , `` there will be other ways of doing business .
We are reviewing everything .
'' Analysts said Mr. Datuk Tajudin , a newcomer to the airline industry , has few choices in reversing MAS 's slumping prospects .
Most likely he must , they said , spin off several of the airline 's subsidiaries , slash overheads and perhaps sell off the company 's unprofitable domestic operations .
Mr. Datuk Tajudin indicated such moves are in the offing , but he declined to elaborate on specific measures until his new management team has had time to review the airline 's operations .
For the year ended March 31 , MAS 's after-tax profit tumbled 94 % to 8.4 million ringgit on a 9.1 % rise in revenue to 4.08 billion ringgit .
The earnings included pretax proceeds of 11.8 million ringgit from the sale of a Boeing 737-200 aircraft and five spare engines .
MAS 's dividend was cut 80 % to two Malaysian cents a share .
For this fiscal year , MAS will be unable to rely on aircraft sales to boost or even retain a profit , as it did last year .
`` We can not sell any more aircraft , '' Mr. Datuk Tajudin said .
`` We have no more to sell .
'' One thing that wo n't be changed is the Malaysian government 's so-called golden share , which gives the state veto rights over many substantial changes in the airline 's operations .
Mr. Datuk Tajudin said he is n't concerned about possible government interference .
`` I do n't think the government will object to a good business plan , '' he said .
Still , Mr. Datuk Tajudin declined to discuss the airline 's specific problems .
`` If you want to start talking about problems at MAS , we 'll never stop , '' he said .
But he added that the new management team would be able to cut between 40 million ringgit and 50 million ringgit from the company 's annual operating costs within about six months .
Mr. Datuk Tajudin said it would n't be necessary to cut the company 's nearly 20,000-employee work force to achieve cost savings .
He also said it would n't immediately be necessary to close unprofitable routes , particularly in the airline 's domestic network .
He declined to say whether fares would be increased for unprofitable domestic routes .
Mr. Datuk Tajudin said the root causes of MAS 's problems was a `` lack of focus and coordination .
'' He also contended that turning some of the airline 's cost centers -- such as engineering , maintenance and catering -- into more autonomous profit centers would generate additional revenue for the company .
Slumping profits at MAS come at a time when the airline must raise about four billion ringgit to finance its capital-spending plans through 1998 .
The slipping financial figures also cast doubt on Mr. Datuk Tajudin 's ability to repay the 1.79 billion ringgit in bank borrowings used to acquire his MAS stake .
One of the first moments the Bush administration appeared doomed was when the conservative press began to abandon him .
By the time of the 1992 Republican convention , the number of right-of-center journalists who were enthusiastic about the Bush presidency could be counted on the fingers of one hand .
President Clinton has now begun to lose the confidence of opinion journalists who one might expect to be his stalwart champions .
The president still has his admirers in the magazine world , including Time 's Margaret Carlson and Newsweek 's Eleanor Clift .
But several key journalists , whose views align with the moderately liberal New Democrats the president claims to represent , are increasingly critical of the administration .
In Time 's Aug. 15 edition , for example , Michael Kramer -- an early Clinton admirer -- launches an attack on Hillary Rodham Clinton for her conduct after Vincent Foster 's death .
Comparing her answers at an April press conference with the evidence that came out during congressional hearings in August , Mr. Kramer finds her evasive and sly .
`` What we now do know , '' he wrote , `` is that Mrs. Clinton is more like Mr. Clinton than anyone realized ; Slick Willie , meet Slippery Hillary .
'' Mr. Kramer 's counterpart at Newsweek , Joe Klein , is also increasingly skeptical of the Clinton presidency .
Mr. Klein , as the national political reporter of New York magazine in the 1992 campaign , provided early sympathetic coverage of Mr. Clinton that helped to boost his chances against his Democratic rivals .
On May 9 , however , Mr. Klein warned his readers that Mr. Clinton suffered from grave character flaws .
He observed that Paula Jones 's charges of sexual harassment -- although `` unprovable '' like Anita Hill 's -- were related to a substantial character flaw in the president .
The president , Mr. Klein wrote , suffered from `` rhetorical promiscuity , the reckless belief that he can talk anyone into anything -LRB- or , more to the point , that he can talk his way out of anything -RRB- , that he can seduce , and abandon at will and without consequence .
'' He concluded : `` It 's not too much to ask that a leader be mature , fully formed , and not railing about in a narcissistic , existential quest for self-discovery .
'' Recently , Mr. Klein has been quite critical of the Clinton administration 's efforts on crime and health care .
In his Aug. 22 column , he called the debate over health care `` a half-crazed , over-the-top bloviation fiesta , '' with the president and first lady having `` gone off on a sanctimony bender , questioning the motives of any and all who disagree with them .
'' Mr. Klein 's colleague at Newsweek , Jonathan Alter , is also growing skeptical of Mr. Clinton 's ability to lead the nation .
The president 's problem , Mr. Alter explained recently , is that while he campaigned as a `` New Democrat '' committed to change , his technique of governing is `` old , familiar , and in conflict with the tone of his campaign .
It depends on passing conventionally structured bills on party lines lubricated with pork .
'' But the harshest attack on the president in a major magazine was by Michael Kelly in the July 31 New York Times Magazine .
Mr. Kelly is best known for his 1993 article , `` Saint Hillary , '' also in the Times Magazine , which was primarily responsible for ending Mrs. Clinton 's efforts to portray herself as a visionary advocate of `` the politics of meaning .
'' In the July article , Mr. Kelly describes the compromises and shadings of the truth that Mr. Clinton made in his quest for the presidency .
`` Clinton 's life trails him like a particularly single-minded mugger , '' he writes , `` popping out from the shadows every time it seems that the President is for a moment safe -- to whack the staggering victim anew .
'' Mr. Kelly adds : `` The great goal of doing good gave -LCB- Clinton -RCB- license to indulge in the everyday acts of minor corruption and compromise and falsity that the business of politics demands .
Bill Clinton was perceptive enough to master politics -- but not perceptive enough to see what politics was doing to him .
'' In an interesting sign of a Zeitgeist shift , New Yorker editor Tina Brown recently named Mr. Kelly as her magazine 's Washington correspondent .
He succeeds Sidney Blumenthal , an ardent Clinton admirer who will continue to work for the magazine as a staff writer .
Also , Newsweek 's Eleanor Clift has been shifted from White House correspondent to contributing editor , in part , the Washington Post 's Howard Kurtz writes , because `` her bosses had become concerned that Clift 's outspoken support for Clinton as a ` McLaughlin Group ' TV panelist was casting doubt on the magazine 's coverage '' of the president .
Journalists and magazines further to the left have never been admirers of President Clinton ; they feel that he is a craven compromiser .
Nation columnist Alexander Cockburn , for example , calls the president `` McMuffin .
'' The Progressive has run so many anti-Clinton editorials that one reader wrote in to say that he found the Progressive 's `` Clinton-bashing articles more savage than those in my conservative local newspaper , and much more emotionally charged .
'' One of Mr. Clinton 's few remaining fans among this group was , until recently , Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau .
But Mr. Trudeau turned critical this week ; Doonesbury now portrays the president as a waffle .
Mr. Clinton can probably survive attacks from the Progressive and Doonesbury , but when his administration comes under attack from modern liberal journalists at places like Time and Newsweek , it is a sign that he is losing his core constituency .

In a sharp departure from tradition , Time Warner Inc. is considering an outsider to succeed Jason McManus as the editor in chief of Time Warner publications .
According to people familiar with the situation , Norman Pearlstine , former executive editor of The Wall Street Journal , is the leading candidate to succeed Mr. McManus .
Historically , Time Inc. , the magazine and publishing arm of the New York-based entertainment and media giant Time Warner , has always picked its top editorial executive from within its ranks .
As editor in chief , Mr. McManus oversees the world 's largest magazine publisher , whose titles include Time , People , Sports Illustrated , Money and Fortune .
Mr. McManus has made it clear to top editors at Time Inc. that he plans to retire at the end of next year , when his contract expires , and that he is insistent on presiding over an orderly succession .
While Mr. McManus would recommend his successor , the ultimate decision lies with Gerald Levin , Time Warner 's chairman , and the Time Warner board .
Time Inc. and Time Warner officials declined to comment .
Mr. McManus could n't be reached .
Speaking by telephone from his Key West , Fla. , residence , Mr. Pearlstine said : `` I ca n't help you on that , '' when asked if he is a candidate for the Time job .
He added : `` It 's no secret I am talking to a lot of people about a lot of different things .
'' Time Inc. insiders cautioned that the succession process is far from over , and that as far as they knew , Mr. Pearlstine had n't formally been offered the job .
Other top candidates considered for Mr. McManus 's job include Time Inc. editorial director Henry Muller , who is the former managing editor of Time magazine , and James R. Gaines , the current top editor at Time magazine .
Also mentioned as a candidate by top Time Inc. editors is Walter Isaacson , Time Inc. 's editor of new media .
Currently , Mr. Pearlstine is chairman of Friday Holdings L.P. , a closely held investment concern that was formed to invest in and operate media and communications companies .
He established the firm in early 1993 after serving as executive editor of the Journal .
His backers included prominent investors and media executives , such as Barry Diller , chairman of QVC Inc. , Texas-based investor Richard Rainwater and Paramount Communications Inc. , now a unit of Viacom Inc. .
According to people close to Friday Holdings , Mr. Pearlstine is now overseeing the dismantling of his partnership .
These people said that the company 's assets will be divided among the partners .
That process will take a while , said one person close to the company , who also confirmed that Mr. Pearlstine has been in talks with Time Inc. .
Mr. Pearlstine 's wife , the author Nancy Friday , for whom the partnership was named , is also an investor .
Mr. Pearlstine said late yesterday that he was `` still at Friday trying to make sense of the partnership .
'' He added that it was `` clear that Paramount and QVC wo n't be an easy source of additional capital .
Beyond that , I ca n't say anything .
'' Mr. Pearlstine was the Journal 's managing editor from 1983 to 1991 , overseeing a major expansion of the paper 's editorial coverage .
He was named executive editor in 1991 , after which he oversaw the launch of SmartMoney , a personal finance magazine launched in a joint venture with Hearst Corp. .
He resigned from The Journal in 1992 and later started Friday Holdings .
The issue of Mr. McManus 's successor is timely now as Time Warner turns to a new generation of top executives .
Earlier this month , the media giant named Don Logan as the new chief executive of Time Inc. .
Mr. Logan himself was an outsider who joined Time 's ranks in 1985 .
But he recently won the approval and admiration of Mr. Levin for his entrepreneurial ideas and cost-cutting efforts in the magazine division .
Any new editor in chief at Time Inc. would become part of the new era at Time Warner , which is attempting to use its magazines as resources for new multimedia properties .
In addition , Time Warner has curtailed its efforts to launch new , large-circulation magazines , such as Entertainment Weekly , whose circulation has grown significantly but is still unprofitable after four years .
Instead , it has started up or has invested in a string of smaller , special-interest publications , such as the rap music magazine Vibe and Martha Stewart Living , a home and gardening magazine .
HELSINKI -- Finland 's stock market may be small , but it is one of the best performers in the world .
Many money managers bet it will continue to rise as the global economy regains strength .
The Finnish stock market is up 21 % so far this year , according to the Dow Jones World Stock Index .
But when measured in dollars instead of markkas , that gain amounts to 40 % .
This year 's rise follows last year 's awesome 74 % jump in dollar terms .
Behind it all `` is the most extraordinary case of a country-restructuring story that reads like a corporate-restructuring story , '' says Andrew Garthwaite , a global strategist at S.G. Warburg & Co. , London .
At the start of the decade , the Soviet Union -- Finland 's biggest export market -- collapsed , Western Europe entered its steepest recession in 60 years and the Finnish economy fell off a cliff .
Unemployment shot up to 20 % from 3.4 % .
Corporate profits turned negative in 1991 , 1992 and 1993 .
From early 1990 to 1993 , Finland 's gross domestic product plunged 15 % .
From its record high in April 1989 , the Helsinki stock market plummeted 73 % before bottoming out Sept. 7 , 1992 , the day before Finland broke the markka 's link with the European currency unit , a hybrid of 12 European currencies that closely tracks the German mark .
Blue chips fell 90 % .
Five months later , the Finnish currency was nearly 40 % weaker against the dollar and 25 % to 30 % lower against the mark ; short-term interest rates had tumbled to 5.5 % from 17 % .
`` The country was bankrupt .
They cut interest rates and kept letting them decline ; they devalued the currency and let it keep falling until it stopped , '' says John Hickling , a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments in Boston .
`` They did n't care about inflation ; they were in a depression , '' the worst in this century .
The weak markka and lower interest rates gave Finnish exports the boost they needed and put corporate balance sheets back on the road to profitability .
`` Floating the markka is what saved the Finnish economy and the stock market , '' says Petri Kovalainen , an institutional broker at Postipankki in Helsinki .
The government added an extra kicker : Taxes on stock transactions were abolished , those on capital gains and dividends slashed .
At the start of 1993 , all restrictions on foreign stock-ownership were lifted .
Overnight , the weighting of Finnish shares in standard international equity benchmarks jumped sevenfold , triggering a flood of overseas investment .
Net result : Finnish stocks soared 93 % in 1993 , in markka terms .
Nonetheless , many investors and analysts think Finnish stocks have a lot more room to rise .
One reason is booming exports .
`` Until now , export growth to a large extent related to the weakening Finnish mark and cost cutting by Finnish companies , '' says Esko Haavisto , head of investment research at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki , one of Finland 's largest banks .
`` But finally , export markets are now picking up , '' as Finland 's major European trading partners begin to emerge from recession .
Domestically , he says corporate investment is rising , and he predicts domestic consumption will grow in the fall .
KOP predicts 2.5 % economic growth this year , 4.5 % in 1995 .
Inflation is a low 1.3 % .
And with unemployment at 18 % and loads of excess capacity in Finnish manufacturers , few analysts see inflation being a problem for at least two years .
What 's more , corporate profits are expected to zoom , making Finnish equities cheap , despite their runup .
Selling at 9.5 times projected 1995 earnings , Finnish shares are cheaper than those in nine major European markets plus the U.S. and Japan , Mr. Haavisto notes .
He says the price-earnings ratio for the forestry industry is an amazingly low six .
S.G. Warburg projects nonfinancial Finnish company profits will surge 46 % next year , and Mr. Garthwaite says , `` the stock market could quite easily go up another 20 % .
'' Noting that global growth spells increased demand for raw materials , Kim Sjoestroem , a senior analyst at Carnegie Securities Finland in Helsinki , recommends buying three forest companies -- Metsae-Serla , Enso-Gutzeit and Repolametals company Outokumpu and steelmaker Rautaruukki .
He 's also high on Valmet , a maker of paper-production machinery .
`` Pulp prices are expected to double from 1993 to 1996 , '' he says .
Many Finnish companies , he adds , are lean and mean after shrinking high debt loads and cutting employees .
`` Labor productivity has increased while GDP has gone down , '' says Mr. Sjoestroem , noting that employment in the forest and metals industries is down 20 % from 1991 .
Postipankki analyst Johan Rinne favors Nokia , even though the mobile-phone maker 's shares have jumped 12-fold since late 1992 .
He also sees transport company Finnlines benefiting from increased trade between the West and Russia .
For a sleeper , he likes drug maker Orion .
It trades over the counter , but the company plans to list on the Helsinki exchange by summer 1996 , Mr. Rinne says .
When it does , he says it will prompt buying by foreign investors who currently hold less than 1 % of its shares .
At the same time , analysts quickly note that the Helsinki market 's strengths can also be its Achilles heel .
Apart from South Africa 's stock market , Finland has the highest exposure to basic industry -- 47 % , says Mr. Garthwaite of S.G. Warburg .
`` When the downturn comes in the international economy , it will have a major effect on the Finnish economy , '' warns KOP 's Mr. Haavisto .
Exports , he notes , account for 34 % of GDP .
Moreover , foreigners , who own 20 % to 25 % of the Finnish stock market , can cut and run as quickly as they bought shares .
`` One of the dangers is if foreigners or big numbers of them decide this is n't the best market in the world , it is going to hurt us , '' says Mr. Kovalainen of Postipankki .
Furthermore , the Helsinki market 's relatively small size would exacerbate any mass exit .
At about $ 33 billion , its market capitalization is smaller than that of several emerging stock markets and about one-tenth the size of Canada 's .
A big concern for some investors is the stability of neighboring Russia , which shares an 840-mile border with Finland .
`` We 're not afraid of what happens in Russia , '' Mr. Kovalainen says .
`` But others , especially Americans and even some Europeans , think differently : They look at the map and worry .
'' Juha Kaiponen , a senior vice president at the Helsinki Stock Exchange , worries that high union-wage demands this fall and increased government borrowing could slow economic recovery .
S.G. Warburg 's Mr. Garthwaite , however , is more sanguine .
He argues that the country 's budget deficit will fall as the economy recovers and unemployment shrinks .
`` Look at the score card : Finland 's valuation is attractive , and the structural component of the budget deficit is very low , '' he says .
`` We 're in a world where we want to buy economies with a lot of excess capacity , cheap inflation hedges -- and as pulp and paper pick up , that 's an inflation hedge -- and we are in a world where we want an exposure to late cycle areas .
Finland offers that .

TOKYO -- General Electric Capital Corp. agreed to buy three consumer-credit businesses from Minebea Co. , giving the U.S. financial-services company a strong foothold in the Japanese market for consumer credit .
The planned transaction is a rare example of a foreign acquisition of Japanese business interests .
GE Capital , a unit of General Electric Co. , Fairfield , Conn. , will acquire the assets outstanding of the three Minebea subsidiaries , which specialize in consumer installment loans .
Minebea is a Japanese maker of ball bearings .
Officials at both companies declined to disclose the exact value of the transaction .
The units being acquired have consumer receivables outstanding of 120 billion yen -LRB- $ 1.2 billion -RRB- .
`` The transaction will provide GE Capital with a platform in Japan , the second largest financial-services market in the world , '' the companies said in a joint statement .
The transaction comes at a tumultuous time for GE 's financial-services efforts .
A spokeswoman for GE Capital in Tokyo declined to comment on how the planned transaction , which has yet to obtain regulatory approval , might affect the broader GE firmament .
GE 's financial businesses include the troubled brokerage firm Kidder Peabody & Co. .
Analysts said GE Capital , with 1993 net income of $ 1.8 billion , is poised to apply its resources to the Japanese market at a time when consumption is showing signs of recovering from a prolonged slump .
Personal bankruptcies , which have increased in recent years , probably have peaked , said Nozomu Kunishige , banking analyst at Kleinwort Benson .
The move , however , is n't without risks .
`` Japan 's consumer-credit market is maturing , and competition is intensifying , '' Mr. Kunishige said .
Other analysts say that interest rates in Japan have hit bottom and may be headed higher , another negative for the nation 's financial-services market .
Still , GE Capital 's broad experience in the credit business will help the company navigate the uncertain interest-rate environment and hold its own against domestic competitors , analysts said .
`` This is a great opportunity for GE , '' said David Snoddy , a financial analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities .
For Minebea , the transaction offers a convenient exit from largely unsuccessful attempts to diversify into businesses other than its core ball-bearing operations .
Minebea said the transaction includes undisclosed provisions that will help it write off some of the problem loans the company incurred after diversifying into the real-estate business .
Minebea will retain control of the troubled mortgage business of Minebea Credit Co. , the largest of the three units .
`` The proceeds to be received by Minebea from this transaction will greatly reduce the potential losses of the real-estate loan portfolio , '' the companies ' joint statement said .
Ryosuke Mizukami , Minebea 's general manager of corporate planning , said the transaction with GE Capital will free up about 120 billion yen in loan guarantees that Minebea has been providing to the three subsidiaries .
If the acquisition is completed , the Minebea purchase would be GE Capital 's third purchase of a consumer financing business in the past two months .
Last week , GE Capital signed a definitive agreement to purchase an 80 % stake in Australian Guarantee Taiwan , a Taiwan-based automotive and equipment leasing and lending business .
In July , GE Capital agreed with Swedish insurance company Foersaekrings AB Skandia to acquire the consumer-financing assets of its Denmark-based AS Nevi Danmark subsidiary .
A list of lawyers who have run afoul of the law will soon be available on line .
The American Bar Association 's National Discipline Data Bank -- 25,000 lawyers ' names , addresses , aliases and violations -- will be available at the touch of a button .
But not to everyone : The ABA , at least initially , is offering the service only to disciplinary authorities .
The restriction has spurred criticism from legal-reform groups , who say that all clients should have easy access to information about lawyers ' wrongdoing .
Discipline boards , bar associations and courts applaud the service , however .
Because each state regulates its own lawyers , discipline is complicated as attorneys become increasingly mobile and register in more than one state .
Lawyers who get in trouble in one state sometimes try to move a few miles away , sign up for another state 's bar examination and start over without notifying authorities or alerting potential clients .
`` This is a good first step toward ensuring that jurisdictions can get the information they need , '' says Margaret Morrow , president of the State Bar of California , which regulates attorneys in the state .
An on-line service will help track attorneys who take money from clients and then skip town , says Frederick Miller , executive director of the New York Lawyers ' Fund for Client Protection .
The ABA has long kept a national list of public disciplinary actions , ranging from public censure to temporary suspension to outright disbarment .
Discipline can be imposed as a result of any conduct that violates a lawyer 's professional obligations , including the commission of a crime .
The data bank does n't include complaints or private reprovals .
Until now , however , this information has been available only by phone , fax or mail , with two staffers filling all requests .
The on-line service will give authorities simultaneous and instantaneous access to disciplinary information , 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
For example , a state could check the prior discipline records of all applicants to the bar -- a process that is generally unwieldy under the current system .
Or , officials in one area could evaluate how their prosecution rate of bad lawyers compares with that of other jurisdictions .
Direct access to the database will be offered , free of charge in most instances , by Westlaw , an on-line service of West Publishing Co. , in Eagan , Minn. .
It will be available even to designated users who are n't Westlaw customers .
Advocates of tougher attorney-discipline enforcement complain that the service should be more widely available .
`` It 's an example of the legal profession wanting to protect itself , '' says Theresa Meehan Rudy , a spokeswoman for HALT , a Washington-based legal-reform group .
`` We would love to see a database truly accessible to the public through a toll-free number , '' Ms. Rudy says .
`` The fact that it 's on Westlaw maybe is a step in the right direction .
But because it will have a limited audience , it 's really of little use to the consumers who need the information the most .
'' The ABA declined to make the on-line service accessible to the public because people might use `` slightly inaccurate '' information to harm the reputation of an innocent attorney , says Jeanne Gray , director of the ABA 's Center for Professional Responsibility , which administers the database .
Ms. Gray says the ABA data bank includes lawyers with names similar to those of lawyers not on the list , as well as records of past disciplinary actions that may no longer be in force .
`` There is a great deal of exposure associated with '' the list , Ms. Gray says .
`` We could be liable '' for defamation or invasion of privacy .
Regulators , by contrast , would use the information mainly as a tool for further investigation , she says .
As a phone - or mail-in service , the data bank is n't used as often as it might be , Ms. Gray concedes .
`` Any time anybody ca n't access data immediately and efficiently , they 're likely to be deterred from using it , '' she says .
Although it has been kept for about 25 years , the data bank is n't widely publicized `` because if we had 200 people calling us every day , it would be a monumental problem , '' she says .
A test of the on-line system is scheduled to begin in three states , probably California , Illinois and Massachusetts , next month .
West spokeswoman Dorothy Molstad says it could be up and running nationwide as early as six months from now .
The company says it expects about three or four courts or disciplinary agencies in each state to sign up .
Meanwhile , ABA staffers will continue to take questions from the public about lawyers ' records .
Use of the on-line service by regulators will free up the staff to answer more inquiries from laypeople , and input states ' reports of violations more quickly , the ABA 's Ms. Gray says .
The impetus for the on-line service came from a 1992 ABA study of the lawyer-discipline system , known as the McKay Report , that recommended , among other reforms , linking the ABA 's existing data bank to a computer telecommunications network .
After about a year of talks with West , the ABA and the publishing company reached an agreement under which West will contribute about $ 1 million in services to set up the program .
The ABA plans to spend about $ 400,000 over the next three years to bolster staff and pay for technical support .
`` It 's a major commitment of resources on both sides , '' Ms. Gray says .
West 's investment , which is being billed as a public service , is n't entirely altruistic .
Disciplinary officials will only get unlimited , free on-line access to the ABA database if they agree to hand over to West a complete roster of all lawyers , not just those who have been penalized , who have registered in their state .
Otherwise , the officials will be charged $ 90 an hour to use the on-line service .
High-tech services are on the shopping lists of most big law firms .
Here are some of the automation tools that law firms of 50 or more attorneys say they plan plan to buy in the next five years .
PARIS -- If a patent were stolen , could it be infringed ?
That 's the question arising in a trans-Atlantic court case that threatens to resurrect some unhappy memories of industrial-espionage allegations that soured U.S.-French business relations four years ago .
Yesterday , Cie. des Machines Bull , France 's state-owned computer company , confirmed that it filed a suit in the U.S. against Texas Instruments Inc. last October concerning copyright infringement of its microprocessor technology .
Bull 's announcement was prompted by an article about the suit appearing in the French weekly L'Express .
But , according to L'Express , Texas Instruments has retorted that the chip Bull claims to have developed was based on technology stolen from the U.S. company during a French industrial espionage action that allegedly was uncovered by U.S. authorities in 1990 .
Bull denies any connection to industrial-espionage activity by French agents , saying it `` had no knowledge of such activity , which in any event would be contrary to the policies and interests of the company .
'' The suit has been transferred to Texas District Court in Dallas , where Texas Instruments is based .
A Texas Instruments spokeswoman declined to comment on the case .
`` We have a policy that we wo n't discuss anything related to either industrial espionage or pending litigation , '' she said .
`` This falls into both categories .
'' News of the legal wrangle may provide some uncomfortable publicity for Bull , just as the government is trying desperately to sell off the unprofitable computer maker .
LONDON -- British Telecommunications PLC said pretax profit fell about 7 % in its fourth quarter ended March 31 , as revenue and telephone traffic continued to stagnate because of competition and poor economic conditions .
But BT officials saw a definite silver lining in the profit drop : It may relieve regulatory pressure on the company .
Indeed , BT 's official statement highlighted the fact that the former telecommunications monopoly 's full-year profit had fallen for the first time since its privatization in 1984 .
Executives also made sure to note that BT 's fourth-quarter return on capital , a widely watched profit indicator , had dropped below 18 % for the first time in recent years .
The dip in annual earnings `` must strengthen our hand '' against Oftel , the agency that oversees telecommunications regulations , BT Chairman Iain Vallance said .
Since September , the company has been forced to limit its price increases to a rate 6.25 % below inflation , a formula that , given the U.K. 's current low-inflation regime , effectively guarantees price cuts .
Yesterday BT pointed to its lackluster fourth-quarter performance as an argument for Oftel to ease restrictions .
For the quarter , BT posted a pretax profit of # 704 million -LRB- $ 1.29 billion -RRB- , down from # 756 million a year earlier .
For the year ended March 31 , BT 's pretax profit edged down a minuscule # 2 million to just over # 3.07 billion .
The company paid a final dividend of 8.7 pence a share , up from 8.05 pence the previous year , bringing the total fiscal 1992 dividend to 14.4 pence , up more than 8 % .
The results were about as expected .
After a downward blip , BT finished up eight pence , at 360 pence , in a down market .
CLEVELAND -- Associated Estates Realty Corp. said it received a commitment from National City Bank to increase its London Interbank Offered Rate-based line of credit facility to $ 125 million from $ 75 million .

Associated Estates is a real-estate investment trust that invests in multifamily apartment buildings .

LOS ANGELES -- A man who authorities believe was responsible for defrauding a string of small businesses while working as the firms ' accountant was indicted by a federal grand jury yesterday .
Donald L. Peterson was accused of fraud and money laundering in the alleged theft of more than $ 700,000 in the past few years .
Mr. Peterson , who is currently in a state jail , could n't be reached to comment .
However , his attorney noted that Mr. Peterson has pleaded not guilty to similar pending state charges .
The federal indictment asserts that Mr. Peterson , using various aliases , would get hired as a bookkeeper and then forge checks from his employers , with the funds being deposited into bank accounts controlled by him and accomplices .
Two alleged accomplices were also indicted .
The man believed to be Mr. Peterson 's main accomplice , Patrick W. Finnigan , is a fugitive , says Carolyn Kubota , the assistant U.S. attorney on the case .
The other man , Gregory Gwynn , is currently in state prison , she added .
Mr. Peterson was arrested earlier this year after his employer read a story in The Wall Street Journal about a mysterious embezzling bookkeeper who had been stealing from businesses for years .
The employer then called the police .
Fabri-Centers of America Inc. said it acquired the Cloth World division of Brown Group Inc. of St. Louis .
The purchase price will approximate Cloth World 's book value , which was $ 62 million for the fiscal year ended Jan. 30 .
The acquisition , expected to be completed by Oct. 2 , will leave Fabri-Centers with nearly 1,000 retail stores in every state but Hawaii .
Fabri-Centers , Hudson , Ohio , currently has 652 stores in 36 states , principally in the northern two-thirds of the country .
Most of its stores operate under the name Jo-Ann Fabrics & Crafts .
Sales for the year ended Jan. 30 were $ 582.1 million .
Cloth World has 343 stores in 26 states , mostly in the southern U.S. Its sales for the year ended Jan. 30 were $ 224.1 million .
Fabri-Centers said the Cloth World name will be retained and few store closings or consolidations are expected .
The acquisition will be funded through borrowing facilities with Fabri-Centers ' existing borrowing group .
DALLAS -- Southwest Airlines said it will build a reservations center , its eighth , in Little Rock , Ark. .
The facility is expected to cost about $ 10 million and will open in January 1995 .
German tire manufacturer Continental AG reported that pretax profit rose 21 % in the first half of 1994 , meeting the company 's expectations , as demand for tires and technical products revived slightly .
Pretax profit totaled 37.8 million marks -LRB- $ 24.5 million -RRB- , up from 31.3 million marks a year earlier .
Sales rose 6.3 % to 4.8 billion marks from 4.52 billion marks .
Continental said the sales result includes newly consolidated divisions such as the Benecke group .
Excluding new divisions , first-half sales would have risen 1.7 % , it said .
New products and numerous cost-cutting measures helped improve results despite aggressive price competition in Europe , Continental said .
The group repeated that it expects its 1994 result to be slightly better than the previous year 's group pretax profit of 74 million marks .
Ford Motor Co. is recalling about 2,600 1994 Lincoln Town Car and Continental sedans to check for a possible problem with the brake system .
On some of these vehicles , a retainer clip on the brake pedal may have been installed improperly .
Improper installation or a missing retainer clip could result in a loss of braking , which could occur without warning .
The Dearborn , Mich. , auto maker said there have been no reports of accidents or injuries in connection with the problem .
Of the vehicles affected , about 78 are located in Canada .
Owners are being notified by mail to schedule service appointments with Lincoln-Mercury dealerships .
Service technicians , at no charge to customers , will inspect the retainer clip for proper installation or replace it if it is missing .
East Rutherford , N.J. -- Whoever said that seeing Mick Jagger onstage was like watching a rooster on acid would 've never believed that the Rolling Stones could survive into the 1980s , much less the '90s .
Surely no one would have predicted that the leader of a band that hired the Hells Angels as concert security in 1969 could end up as one of rock 's wise old men .
But as Stones fans -- some with gold cards , some with spreading tattoos , some probably with both -- know too well by now , anything can happen .
It 's there for all to see : At 51 , Mick looks more like a lizard on vitamin E. We can all rest assured that the aging Stones still have everything working , at various speeds -- from mojo to marketing .
Their current show -LRB- 60 North American dates and several more months overseas -RRB- is the two-hour-plus stadium shebang fans expect of their heroes , and then some .
And it raises the tantalizing possibility that Jagger & Co. could again trick fate like few other rockers .
We 'll forgive Mick and the boys for having to consider fate at all , for at their historical pace by the time they could launch another one of these 55-semitrailer caravans they 'll be eligible for senior-citizen discounts .
They 've buried so many of their platinum-shipping peers -- John Lennon -LRB- and , long before , the Beatles -RRB- , Keith Moon -LRB- and , if the publicity can be believed , The Who as well -RRB- , John Bonham -LRB- and soon thereafter Led Zeppelin -RRB- and Elvis Presley -- not to mention , just this year , 27-year-old Kurt Cobain .
Time , they must realize , is no longer on their side .
The first clue that they have seen the dark at the end of the tunnel is the show 's first number , `` Not Fade Away '' -LRB- written by Buddy Holly , a bright light snuffed out at 32 in a plane crash way back in 1959 -RRB- .
Before long , Jagger is prancing and pouting as ever , but the age thing just wo n't go away : The video screen that dwarfs Charlie Watts 's drum kit below soon presents a computer-gyrated version of the band 's trademark lips with the tongue covered in thorns .
This must be how fiftysomething rock stars feel in the morning .
On they go from there , with songs from three main sources .
Of course there are a few repetitious rockers -LRB- and a couple ballads -RRB- from their newest merchandise , `` Voodoo Lounge .
'' We also hear selections from jukeboxes world-wide -- `` Brown Sugar , '' `` Satisfaction , '' `` Honky Tonk Woman '' and the sole encore , the two nights I saw them here , `` Jumpin ' Jack Flash .
'' But the best songs , and some of their best performances , are those from two of their bestselling albums in the CD era : `` Exile on Main Street '' and `` Some Girls .
'' These are the ones that really drive .
And would n't you know it , each one has a line or two for the aging : `` Rocks Off '' -LRB- `` What 's the matter with you , boy ?
She do n't come around no more ?
'' -RRB- , `` All Down the Line '' -LRB- `` Hear the old man crying ... '' -RRB- , `` Miss You '' -LRB- `` I 've been hangin ' on so long ... '' -RRB- , `` Shattered '' -LRB- `` Love and hope and sex and dreams -- and who 's survivin ' all those things ?
Just look at me -- I 'm shattered '' -RRB- .
The high point comes after a brief animated tour of the virtual Voodoo Lounge and its environs .
Giant balloons over the stage -- Elvis in tuxedo and bolo tie and with acoustic guitar in hand , the Virgin Mary with eyes rolled skyward in silent rapture , an infant with an earring , a cow 's head straight out of Chagall -- serve as guards .
The band runs through the most interesting of its new songs , `` Love Is Strong , '' and then keyboard player Chuck Leavell sounds the opening notes of `` Monkey Man , '' from `` Let It Bleed .
'' For a few moments we get the Stones the way they surely want to be remembered .
And more : Lisa Fischer , previously on stage mostly for safe sex with co-backup singer Bernard Fowler , blows Mick away in their duet .
By song 's end the whole house is rocking , including , literally , those nifty balloons -- allowing the Stones to boast , if they choose , that they 've still got enough of what it takes to move the king of rock and the queen of heaven .
So the Stones are n't afraid to go nose-to-nose with old age , or with the fundamentalists they 'll surely hear from .
They 're also not afraid of a little marketing -LRB- though thankfully a little is all we get -RRB- : These ranking icons of rebellion are lately brought to you by the world 's largest brewery .
And Mick 's not above wearing the band 's latest album cover on one of his T-shirts , nor is Keith Richards leery of the skull-covered shirt he sports in their new music video .
Certainly other much newer bands take the commercial end of things much further , and certainly the Rolling Stones have earned a bit of self-referential hype .
Another shirt , this one from the wide array of `` official '' gear on sale at the show , reminds us just how long these fellows have been at this stuff -LRB- their first recording was released in 1963 -RRB- .
Fashioned after a laundry tag , it reads , `` Stones Withstand Divorce , Slander , Ripoffs , Slagging , Under-Age Sex , Alcohol , Drugs .
Wash Thoroughly .
'' The assembled must wonder , perhaps as they hurry home after midnight to children who 'll be awake in a few hours , how long the Stones can keep it up .
Jagger has the lungs to run the stage with a straight face this year and next , but after that ?
The obvious answer leads quickly to this modest plea to the putative World 's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band : Go gently .
Be that rare act that goes before it has to -LRB- and without a gratuitous `` Farewell '' spectacle -RRB- .
You ca n't need the money .
You ca n't be more famous .
All that 's left is to spare the world the sight of a 60-year-old man onstage shouting , `` I ca n't get no satisfaction .
'' WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is looking into whether banks are violating antitrust laws in setting fees .
The department would n't disclose any specific allegations , saying only that `` the antitrust division is conducting an investigation that involves certain practices of the banking industry .
'' Two consumer-advocate groups , the Consumer Federation of America and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group , believe the banking industry is overcharging customers for basic services like the use of automated teller machines , and possibly setting industry prices at seminars and conferences .
The two groups brought the matter to the Justice Department in June .
In a letter to Assistant Attorney General Anne Bingaman , they wrote , `` We would urge you to place particular emphasis on price fixing , price discrimination and related unfair trade practices that are prohibited under the Sherman Act .
'' Despite the reticence of the Justice Department to elaborate on the investigation , consumer advocates are encouraged by the department 's involvement and are confident that the results of an investigation will support their allegations .
`` Bank fees are rising much faster than inflation , and consumers are being hammered in the pocketbooks by this , '' said Ed Mierzwinski , an official with U.S. Public Interest Research Group .
`` The fact that the department is investigating ought to send a message to the banking industry .
'' ISLANDIA , N.Y. -- Software maker Computer Associates International Inc. , aiming to boost sales to small businesses , slashed prices on one of its key products by an average of 70 % .
The company is discounting its Unicenter software , which businesses use to monitor and control computers running the Unix operating system .
CA said its move is designed to hook smaller businesses or departments within larger companies .
These customers-typically users of mainframe computerscould switch to lower-cost , Unix-based machines , CA said .
But the company is also responding to rivals that have been beating CA to these customers .
These rivals include Hewlett-Packard Co. , OpenVision Technologies Inc. and Tivoli Systems Inc. .
`` If someone wants to stay in the business , they 're going to have to remain competitive with this new pricing , '' said Kurt Seibert , a CA vice president .
Frank Moss , president and chief executive of Tivoli , of Austin , Texas , scoffed : `` Tivoli sees no price pressure at all .
We see very little competition in our .
.
market .
'' Analysts agreed .
`` CA did this because they were priced out of the market for small sites , '' said Patrick McBride , program director for researcher Meta Group , of Westport , Conn. .
While the price cut could propel CA into the market , it probably wo n't hurt rivals .
`` There 's a lot of running room for a lot of people , '' Mr. McBride said .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading , CA 's shares closed at $ 40 , up 62.5 cents a share .
NEW YORK -- A New York investment firm said it will acquire the Channel Home Centers and Rickel Home Centers chains , creating an expanded Rickel home-improvement retail chain in the Northeast .
Eos Partners L.P. said it will acquire all 60 Channel stores from GE Capital Corp. , which will retain an interest in the newly formed chain , and the 33-store Rickel chain from Supermarkets General Holdings Corp. , Woodbridge , N.J. Company executives said they expect the chain to fall comfortably between expansive warehouse concept chains and the mom-and-pop hardware store .
Under the agreement , Eos said it will pay $ 35 million to GE Capital , which will retain a 45 % interest in the chain ; $ 80 million to Supermarkets General ; and $ 15 million toward capitalized leases .
Eos , which will have a 45 % interest in the chain , said it will spend another $ 30 million on store upgrades and expansion , which it hopes to complete next year .
It said Rickel management and other investors will hold the remaining 10 % interest in the company .
Eos Partners was founded earlier this year by Steven M. Friedman and Brian D. Young , two former partners of Odyssey Partners L.P. Jules Borshadel , 55 years old and a 29-year veteran with Supermarkets General , will be president and chief executive officer of the new Rickel Home Centers Inc. .
Supermarkets General controls more than 320 Pathmark supermarkets and drugstores and real estate .
GE Capital is a unit of General Electric Co. , Fairfield , Conn. .
Dutch insurance and banking conglomerate International Nederlanden Groep NV said first-half net income rose 19 % .
ING said earnings rose to 1.07 billion guilders -LRB- $ 614.3 million -RRB- from 897 million guilders a year earlier , exceeding analysts ' expectations for profit of as much as 1.05 billion guilders .
Per-share profit rose by a narrower 14 % , because of a slight increase in the number of shares outstanding due to the payment of dividend in stock .
Combined with a higher-than-expected interim dividend of 1.75 guilders , up from last year 's 1.60 guilders , the news caused ING 's share price to jump 1.8 guilders , or 2.3 % , to 80.8 guilders on the Amsterdam stock exchange .
For the full year , the company is forecasting per-share net income will at least match 1993 's 8.01 guilders .
Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. , a major ship and heavy-machinery manufacturer , said it will suspend its dividend for the fiscal first half ending Sept. 30 .
The Japanese company had intended to pay an interim dividend of two yen -LRB- two cents -RRB- a share , but it said its profits for the half are going to be hurt by the strong yen .
The continued sluggishness of new investment in plant and equipment in Japan is also hurting the profit outlook , the company said .

According to Borden documents , Jays -- which includes the No. 1-selling potato chip in the Chicago area -- posted an operating loss of $ 13.3 million in 1993 compared with a loss of $ 4 million in 1992 .
Borden declined to comment on the financial results .
The sale is part of the food and chemicals company 's plan to sell its troubled North American snacks business .
The company acquired a number of regional snack businesses in the 1980s , only to be hurt by heavy price discounting and promotional spending .
Lake Forest , Ill. -- A heart attack almost always comes as a shock to a man who 's just turned 35 years old , but few denied that frightening reality more vehemently than Jay Hilgenberg , a longtime National Football League center .
He was working out in the basement weight room of his suburban home here with quarterback Mike Tomczak , a former Chicago Bears teammate , on April 8 when he experienced chest pain .
The two stopped exercising and went outdoors while Hilgenberg caught his breath .
When the pain went away , they shrugged it off as muscular and returned to pumping iron .
A second jolt of pain convinced the 6-foot-3 , 275-pound Hilgenberg that he 'd lifted enough ; he suggested they knock it off for the day .
Tomczak countered by challenging Hilgenberg to a game of ping-pong .
They played and Hilgenberg won , 11-0 .
`` I 'll never let him forget that , '' Hilgenberg chortles .
That was Friday .
Hilgenberg felt better the next morning and worked out again .
More chest pains , this time extending into his arms .
Still , it was Monday before he heeded the urgings of his wife , Lisa , and saw a doctor .
A `` small '' heart attack was diagnosed and he underwent an angioplasty , in which a tiny balloon is used to open a clogged artery .
His football career was over , and he was under physicians ' orders to lose weight , pronto .
`` I always figured I 'd have to start dieting when I quit playing , but I had n't figured on starting this soon , '' he remarks .
Hilgenberg , who spent 11 seasons with the Bears and a season each with the Cleveland Browns and New Orleans Saints , left professional football without bitterness .
`` I made good money playing a game I really liked .
How can I complain ?
'' he asks .
He adds , though , that his career might have been a mixed blessing .
`` I guess it was n't the healthiest lifestyle , carrying all that weight , '' he admits .
The issue of the size of the players in rock 'em - sock 'em professional football , linemen in particular , has been raised with increasing frequency in recent years , but with little effect .
Another NFL season begins on Sept. 4 , and the players will be bigger than ever .
Thirty years ago , 250 pounds was considered ample for an offensive lineman in the league .
By the early 1980s , that standard had risen to about 280 pounds .
Now it 's at 300 pounds , and climbing .
While there 's anecdotal evidence that hauling such poundage around a football field can lead to early death , it 's less than conclusive .
The largest study of the subject to date , involving some 7,000 NFL veterans , was released last year by the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety and the NFL Players Association .
It found that , on average , former players were n't dying younger than other American men .
But most of the players in the survey performed before weight levels zoomed in earnest .
Hilgenberg 's personal weight history almost parallels that of his sport .
He grew up in Iowa City , Iowa , aspiring to continue his family 's peculiar tradition of playing center for the hometown University of Iowa football teams .
His father , Jerry , and older brother , Jim , manned that post before him , and a younger brother , Joel , currently with the NFL Saints , would follow .
Jay liked to joke that his was the only clan that played catch back-to-back and bent over .
But his weight at graduation time was 217 pounds , too light for the Big Ten .
Weight lifting and serious chowing got him up to 235 pounds by the time he enrolled at Iowa , and in his four years there he put on 15 pounds .
That was too light for the pros , and he was n't drafted out of college .
Again , he showed 'em ; signed by the Bears as a free agent in 1981 , he entered his first training camp at about 260 pounds .
He played at between that weight and 265 during the seven years -LRB- 1985-91 -RRB- he earned Pro Bowl honors .
He added 10 pounds in the last years of his career to better handle the bigger men who were lining up across from him .
At 275 Hilgenberg was smallish for his position , but maintaining that poundage on a 6-foot-3 frame took considerable doing nonetheless .
He avers that steroids were n't involved , but a lot of weight lifting was , as was some heroic eating .
`` I did n't eat until I was full ; I ate until I was tired , '' says he straight-facedly .
`` Eating got to be a kind of game , '' he goes on .
`` When I was with the Bears , we offensive linemen would go out for dinner together every Thursday night , and everybody 'd order at least two entrees apiece .
One guy -- John Wojciechowski -- used to add one thing to what anybody else ate .
He was unbelievable .
'' Hilgenberg says that aside from a high-cholesterol count , for which he took medication , he had no health problems except for typical football injuries until last year , when he was with the Saints .
He experienced chest discomfort during two late-season practices , and notified the team 's physician after the second episode .
For his pains , he got a clean bill of health -LRB- `` the doctor said something about scar tissue acting up '' -RRB- and a ribbing from the team 's equipment manager , who rigged up a jersey with Hilgenberg 's name over the number `` 911 .
'' He notes that the memory of that incident might have kept him from seeking medical help immediately after his April attack .
Hilgenberg is taking bigger doses of cholesterol-fighting medicine now , and took to heart his doctors ' advice to drastically cut his intake of fat .
He also was told to stick to aerobic exercise , mainly walking .
He 's down to 245 pounds , feels fine , and aims to lose between 20 and 25 pounds more .
Among other benefits of this transformation is that it 's been easier for him to buy clothes , and he has a bigger turn on his golf swing .
He has n't missed football so far , but allows that he might once the season starts .
He laughs that his only regret is that he never got up enough speed on a field to hit anybody really hard .
`` I 've got a lot to be grateful for , including , I think , going out the way I did , '' he says .
Kelley Oil Corp. said it presented a proposal for the consolidation of Kelley Oil and Kelley Oil & Gas Partners Ltd. to a special committee of the board .
Under the proposal , a new company would be created that combines the corporation and the partnership .
The Houston-based company said investors would swap one partnership unit for one new common share , or one new convertible preferred share of the successor company , to be named Kelley Oil & Gas Corp. Each existing common share would be swapped for 1.13 common shares of the new company .
Kelley Oil has about 17.6 million shares outstanding .
The partnership has about 19.5 million units outstanding , excluding those held by Kelley Oil .
Kelley Oil is managing general partner of Kelley Oil & Gas Partners and currently owns 13.5 % of Kelley Partners .
STOCKHOLM -- Esselte AB plans to reorganize its office-supply operations in a move designed to increase management flexibility .
The Swedish company said the reorganization will involve the closure of the group 's division offices in London for Letraset and Dymo and the creation of four regional divisions that will report directly to group management .
Esselte boasts six billion kronor -LRB- $ 786 million -RRB- of office-supply sales annually , and the company said the organizational changes are in response to structural changes in the office-supply market .
The new organization brings together all of the group 's office-supply operations into one business area with four regional divisions .
The Stockholm-based division will be responsible for northern Europe and Japan .
Other divisions will be in Paris , responsible for central and southern Europe ; London , responsible for Great Britain , the Far East and Africa ; and New York , responsible for North America .
Esselte 's Letraset and Dymo units , with annual revenue of 1.3 billion kronor , will become a separate business area of the group and change names to Nielsen & Bainbridge .
The changes , which will take effect immediately , will make it easier for the group to quickly respond to changes in the market , Esselte said .
`` This way , we also reduce the number of management levels within the group , which increases our flexibility , '' group President Bo Lundquist said .
British insurance company Guardian Royal Exchange PLC said it reported a pretax loss in the first half of # 286 million -LRB- $ 440.3 million -RRB- , compared with a profit of # 307 million a year earlier , including losses on investments .
Excluding investments , the company said in London that it posted a trading profit of # 131 million in the first half , more than double the year-earlier # 65 million .
John Robins , chief executive , said the strong growth in the company 's trading profit , which includes the underwriting result and investment income , was driven by `` a strong underwriting performance in the U.K. '' New accounting rules require insurance companies to reflect investment gains and losses in their profit and loss account .
Net investment losses totaled # 417 million in the first half .
Mr. Robins said the overall structure of the investment portfolio `` has demonstrated its resilience in difficult markets .
'' Chiron Corp. said it filed a lawsuit against two companies that allegedly infringed on its patents on a certain biochemical process .
The Emeryville , Calif. , biotechnology company said it sued Advanced ChemTech of Louisville , Ky. , and SynPep of Dublin , Calif. , in federal district court in San Francisco .
A spokesman for Advanced ChemTech said Chiron was simply responding to a lawsuit Advanced ChemTech filed recently , allegingly that Chiron had an invalid patent and was restraining trade .
A SynPep spokesman said the Chiron suit `` just came out the sky .
We have no idea what they 're talking about .
'' Chiron declined immediate comment .
Separately , Chiron said it adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock .
Baker Hughes Inc. said it has signed a definitive agreement to sell its EnviroTech Pumpsystems unit to Weir Group PLC for $ 210 million .
Baker Hughes , a Houston energy services company , said the sale is subject to approval by Glasgow , Scotland-based Weir Group shareholders and regulators .
The sale is expected to close by Sept. 30 .
EnviroTech Pumpsystems provides specialized pumps to the mineral , mining , chemical , petrochemical and municipal markets .
The unit , which had fiscal 1993 revenue of $ 220 million , saw a pretax profit of between $ 17.6 million and $ 22 million for that period , a Baker Hughes spokesman said .
THE SENATE APPROVED crime legislation that was sought by Clinton .
The measure was passed last night by a 61-38 vote .
Approval of the bill was all but assured after Democrats twice mustered more than the 60 votes needed to defeat GOP procedural moves to block the measure , which Republicans claimed was laden with `` pork '' spending .
Final passage of the crime bill was a crucial win for Clinton .
`` I want to salute the senators of both Republican and Democratic ranks who put law and order , safety and security , above politics and party , '' he said after the bill 's passage appeared certain .
The fight to rescue the crime bill after a House setback two weeks ago diverted valuable time from the health-care bill and helped weaken its prospects .
THE SENATE PUT Clinton 's health-reform legislation on hold until next month .
The Democrats , conceding they lack the votes to enact a bill , said they would allow a recess while party leaders try to forge a compromise with GOP moderates .
Majority Leader Mitchell had vowed to keep the Senate in session through the summer to pass a bill .
Democrats admit the delay leaves little time to pass any broad health legislation before the November elections .
Even without a major bill this year , the health system is being transformed by a flurry of corporate mergers and the rapid growth of HMOs .

Argentina 's Supreme Court dropped accusations against Iranian officials who had been linked to a July 18 bombing that killed nearly 100 people and destroyed a Jewish center .
The court , saying there was insufficient evidence against the officials , returned the case to the investigating judge who implicated four Iranians in the blast .
The U.N. urged Haitian authorities to release 10,000 barrels of fuel needed by 300 aid groups that have been distributing some food and medicine throughout Haiti .
In Port-au-Prince , local radio reported that the military-backed regime had agreed to release the fuel , which arrived in the capital late last month .
Israel rejected demands that a tomb complex at the site of the Feb. 25 Hebron mosque massacre be reopened .
Chief rabbis had asked that the West Bank complex , sacred to Islam and Judaism , be open for the Jewish New Year starting Sept. 5 .

A group of Islamic lawyers have filed a suit in Cairo to try to block the staging of what they call a sinful U.N. population conference from being held in Egypt .
The conference , due to start Sept. 5 , has come under fire from Muslim fundamentalists who say it is contrary to Islamic values .
MANILA , the Philippines -- Tobacco magnate Lucio Tan strengthened his position on Philippine Airlines ' board but remained one seat short of a majority .
At PAL 's annual stockholders ' meeting Thursday , two more Tan associates were named to the national carrier 's 15-member board , bringing to seven the number of seats the publicity-shy entrepreneur controls .
Harry Tan , Mr. Tan 's brother , and Florencio Santos , a director of the Tan-controlled Fortune Tobacco Co. , took seats previously held by the government and a private stockholder .
Manila now holds six seats , with other private groups occupying the remaining two positions .
The new alignment does n't decisively tip the balance of power to Mr. Tan , but does give him more leeway to build a majority with the two swing votes .
It is n't clear , however , how badly he needs that .
Both sides have publicly declared peace .
`` I think we 've learned to live with each other , '' a senior airline official says .
Nonetheless , harmony alone has n't stemmed the flow of red ink at PAL , and some Tan associates question the government 's role in an airline that -- legally , at least -- they control .
Mr. Tan holds a bare majority in PR Holdings , the consortium that owns two-thirds of PAL , giving him in theory the right to name a majority of the airline 's board .
But the government has a bigger overall stake because of the third of the airline it holds directly , in addition to a minority share in PR Holdings .
That has resulted in a compromise both on the board and in management .
Carlos Dominguez , a former cabinet secretary and government nominee on a previous PAL board , serves as the airline 's chairman ; Jose Antonio Garcia , who used to head Mr. Tan 's Asia Brewery Inc. , is its president .
PAL had a loss of 451.4 million pesos -LRB- $ 17.3 million -RRB- for the year ended March 31 , compared with profit of a billion pesos a year earlier .
Ballooning maintenance costs and hefty one-time charges for grounded aircraft and unserviceable parts accounted for much of the plunge .
Genovese Drug Stores Inc. said it opened its first arts and crafts store , The Craft Works , in a mall in Milford , Conn. .
The 12,000-square-foot crafts store will offer more than 35,000 items , including artificial flowers , more than 3,000 types of beads and jewelry findings and more than 300 different types of yarn .
Leonard Genovese , chairman , president and chief executive officer of Genovese Drug Stores , noted that arts and crafts is one of the fastest-growing segments of the retail market .
`` It is our intention to learn from this first store and to build upon our experience , '' he said .
The Melville , N.Y. , company operates a chain of 110 super drugstores in New York , New Jersey and Connecticut .
NEW YORK -- Forstmann Little & Co. has hired Paul G. Stern , former chairman and chief executive officer of Northern Telecom Ltd. , and plans to acquire a company that Dr. Stern will run .
In hiring Dr. Stern , an old hand at running several technology-based companies , Forstmann hopes to tap his technical expertise to help manage some of its current companies and identify future acquisitions .
For Dr. Stern , 54 years old , this step represents the culmination of a longheld desire to `` run my own company .
'' Forstmann surprised the telecommunications industry recently by hiring away Daniel Akerson , president and chief operating officer of MCI Communications Corp. .
Mr. Akerson was a key strategist in MCI 's swift growth and now runs General Instrument Corp. , a fast-growing Forstmann company that is equipping the cable-television and telephone industries in their battle to provide multimedia services .
`` It 's somewhat coincidental '' that Forstmann Little has followed its hiring of Mr. Akerson with Dr. Stern , said Theodore J. Forstmann , senior partner .
However , he acknowledged that Dr. Stern 's technical background and senior management expertise would help Forstmann target `` high-growth '' companies for acquisition , including those involved in multimedia .
Mr. Forstmann declined to comment on the specifics of any acquisition the firm was planning to make .
`` Three years ago , when we bought General Instrument , the conventional wisdom was that it was a dumb thing to do , '' Mr. Forstmann said .
`` But we knew then that General Instrument had great technology and we suspected cable , rather than telephone lines , would provide the primary access to homes .
'' Indeed , General Instrument , whose stock has more than doubled since January , is aggressively working on digital-compression technology , which it invented , and high-definition TV .
Both areas of technology are key elements in the rush toward multimedia services , which combine communications , computers and video technologies .
The company `` is a big horse in the telecommunications race , '' Mr. Forstmann said .
Northern Telecom had posted strong results for the four years it was under Dr. Stern 's stewardship until January .
But a disastrous 1993 second quarter , which the company partly blamed on software problems , led to several media reports that Dr. Stern had been ousted .
Dr. Stern , however , said he left voluntarily because he could n't handle three jobs , those of chairman , chief executive and president , at once .
When he chose Edward Lucente , Northern Telecom 's executive vice president , to take over as president , the board initially agreed on his choice but later changed its mind , Dr. Stern said .
`` It was politics ; the board did n't want two Americans at the top of a Canadian company , '' he added .
Mr. Lucente quit Northern Telecom in March and is now the senior marketing and sales executive at Digital Equipment Corp. .
Dr. Stern also rejected Northern Telecom 's explanation that `` software problems '' hurt the company 's results in recent months .
Northern Telecom `` is n't performing because they keep shuffling people around in different jobs .
It 's defocused , '' he said .
The company expects to report a loss in 1993 .
As a special limited partner at Forstmann , Dr. Stern appears eager to put the last few months of his tenure at Northern Telecom behind him .
In his new position he will help manage certain Forstmann portfolio companies as well as some future investments , for which Forstmann has over $ 2 billion in ready capital .
Dr. Stern also was named a director at Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. , a Forstmann company .
In addition to Northern Telecom , Dr. Stern has held senior executive positions at Unisys Corp. , Burroughs Corp. , Rockwell International Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. .
Forstmann Little is a private investment firm which owns or controls seven operating businesses with total revenue of about $ 4.5 billion .
DENVER -LRB- AP -RRB- -- A federal grand jury is investigating allegations of wrongdoing at Denver International Airport , U.S. Attorney Henry L. Solano confirmed yesterday .
Denver has repeatedly delayed opening the $ 3.7 billion airport because of problems with a high-tech baggage system , which chewed up or misdirected luggage during tests .
`` Based on prior substantial public news reports , I will confirm there is an ongoing investigation concerning Denver International Airport , '' Mr. Solano said .
`` Other than that , I can not comment about the focus or progress of the investigation .
'' Last week , the Associated Press reported that the Denver district attorney 's office was investigating allegations of falsified tests , fraudulent contracting and fraudulent construction practices at the airport .
Chief Deputy District Attorney Phil Parrott confirmed the investigation after the news service reported phony tests and slipshod quality control apparently occurred with alarming frequency during construction of the airport 's runways .
Briggs Gamblin , spokesman for Denver Mayor Wellington Webb , said he was unaware of the federal grand-jury investigation and could n't comment .
LONDON -- The chairman of Scottish & Newcastle PLC said the brewer and leisure group is `` generally optimistic about the prospects for improved trading and has confidence in its ability to compete effectively .
'' Speaking at the annual stockholders meeting in Edinburgh , Scotland , Sir Alick Rankin also said `` competition remains intense '' in the beer market , although beer sales have improved in the past two months .
Sir Alick also said the retail side of the business can be expected to contribute more proportionately to profit once the full-year figures for its newly purchased Chef & Brewer chain of public houses are included .
Now , Scottish & Newcastle 's brewing , license retailing and leisure businesses contribute about one third each to company profits , he said .
The company 's leisure and parks business continues to attract high occupancy levels , Sir Alick said .
The chairman said , however , that the U.K. beer market has `` not been a particularly comfortable place in which to operate , for some time .
'' He called for a `` significant and early '' reduction of the U.K. tax on beer to combat the threat of cross-Channel imports .
Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. reported flat fiscal second-quarter earnings , falling short of Wall Street expectations in the face of continuing competitive pressures in Las Vegas and other key markets .
The casino operator said it earned $ 36.6 million , or 43 cents a share , in the quarter ended July 31 , little changed from the $ 37.4 million , or 43 cents a share , posted a year earlier .
Revenue rose 31 % to $ 299.9 million from $ 228.5 million , driven largely by the Egyptian-themed Luxor casino-resort that opened on the Las Vegas Strip last October .
Operating profit rose 17 % to $ 68.2 million from $ 58.3 million .
The earnings were released after the market closed .
Circus rose 12.5 cents to $ 25.75 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading .
Analysts were expecting earnings of about 46 cents a share , according to a survey of 13 analysts by Institutional Brokers Estimate System .
Clyde Turner , chairman , president and chief executive , said Luxor is continuing to produce solid results , generating operating net of $ 15.9 million .
He also noted that Circus 's net interest expense increased to $ 10.1 million from $ 1.6 million a year ago , reflecting higher debt stemming largely from Luxor and the completion of new attractions at Grand Slam Canyon , a domed attraction area connected to the Circus Circus Las Vegas casino .
Operating net dipped slightly at Circus Circus Las Vegas on improved revenue , while Excalibur , the company 's other major Strip resort , reported a 3.7 % increase in oeprating income despite some softness in per-capita casino spending .
Results in Reno were somewhat depressed by construction of the company 's joint-venture casino nearby .
The company 's two Laughlin , Nev. , casinos reported sharp drops in operating net of 27.5 % and 32 % as the town faces continuing pressure from Las Vegas .
For the six months , Circus reported net income of $ 68.8 million , or 80 cents a share , essentially flat with $ 70.1 million , or 80 cents a share , a year earlier .
Revenue rose about 33 % to $ 584.8 million from $ 438.3 million , while operating net rose 17.4 % to $ 129.3 million from $ 110.1 million in the first half of fiscal 1994 .
Analysts were divided on Circus 's near-term outlook .
Dennis Forst of Hancock Investor Services said he expects earnings to improve , especially as new projects , such as the Tunica , Miss. , riverboat , come on line .
Jeffrey Logsdon of Seidler Cos. said he remains cautious on Circus and expects mixed results , but added , `` there is still value there .
'' Mr. Turner said the company is studying new venues and other means of improving shareholder value .
`` I think we 're going into a season where some acquisitions might , because of price , be attractive to us , '' Mr. Turner said , adding that the company is n't currently engaged in any discussions .
Circus also expects to announce some additions to management in the next several weeks , Mr. Turner added .
MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif. -- A husband and wife who started up two high-tech companies are resigning from their latest venture , Network Computing Devices Inc. .
Judith Estrin , 39 , one of the few women to head a major Silicon Valley company , will resign as president and chief executive officer of Network on Sept. 15 .
Her husband , 44-year-old William Carrico , is stepping down as chairman of the board .
Edward Staiano , 57 , an executive vice president of Motorola Inc. and a Network Computing board member will take over the chairman 's post ; Edward Marinaro , who has been a board member and consultant to the company since January , will become the president and chief executive officer .
The change comes a month after Network Computing , citing competition and pressure to lower prices , posted secondquarter earnings well below analysts ' forecasts .
But Ms. Estrin said she and her husband decided to leave the company because their main interest has always been in start-up operations .
In 1981 , she and Mr. Carrico co-founded a computer communications company known as Bridge Communications , and sold it in 1987 to 3Com Corp. .
BASEL , Switzerland -- Sandoz AG , the chemical and pharmaceuticals group , said it completed its acquisition of Gerber Products Co. of Fremont , Mich. .
Sandoz said based on a preliminary count , 69,081,714 Gerber shares were tendered and accepted for payment by the Wednesday deadline in New York , giving Sandoz 99.2 % of Gerber 's shares outstanding .
The total value of the takeover was put at $ 3.7 billion , Sandoz said .
Gerber will be merged immediately with a North American Sandoz unit set up for that purpose .
Sandoz will control 100 % of the baby-food maker .
Gerber shares outstanding that were n't tendered `` will be canceled and converted automatically into the right to receive $ 53 per share in cash , '' Sandoz said .
Gerber had sales of $ 1.2 billion and net income of $ 127 million for the fiscal year ended in March .
MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Orchestral Association 's board of directors is a virtual who 's who of civic elite .
The 90-year-old symphony orchestra is just the kind of institution that has long entrusted its financial affairs to Piper Jaffray Cos. , a venerable financial-services firm at the pinnacle of Minneapolis 's small , tightly woven business-civic community .
But in the past few months , the cozy relations have been badly frayed as the orchestra watched the value of its derivatives-laden Piper Jaffray investments plunge about $ 2 million .
The orchestra is among thousands of Minnesota charities , government agencies and individuals whose investments have declined sharply in value .
Those losses , which on paper could exceed $ 700 million , resulted from the decisions of one portfolio manager .
Although most of the losses are still unrealized , many of Piper 's investors contend they were misled into believing that they were making a conservative investment , and some are suing for compensation .
`` We do not believe we have done anything wrong , '' says Addison L. `` Tad '' Piper , the firm 's 47-year-old chairman and chief executive .
Piper , of course , is n't the only financial firm to take hits related to derivatives recently .
Several others have felt compelled to compensate investors for their losses .
But so far , Piper has resisted .
Until the portfolios run by Worth Bruntjen blew up , the 99-year-old firm had a reputation for being , if anything , too conservative .
`` Piper was the little old lady of brokerage firms , '' says Robert Markman , president of Markman Capital Management , a money-management consultant here .
`` If they could be faulted for anything , it was that they would bore you to death .
'' A similar reaction comes from Walter E. Weyler , a vice president of the orchestral society 's board who also invested personally in one of Mr. Bruntjen 's funds .
He says he holds Piper 's managers `` in the highest regard for the way they have run their firm and have contributed to the community , but I am very surprised about this investment .
This is not a case of ` That 's the way it goes .
' The fact that these investments could be so volatile was not understood by investors .
'' That many in Minneapolis are dismayed is n't surprising .
`` My grandfather did n't have a mission statement , but we always had values , '' Mr. Piper says .
Even after the paper losses , he was saying , during a lengthy interview last week , words that he has been repeating , with obvious sincerity , for years : `` We have always cared more about our clients than ourselves .
'' Mr. Piper works in a glass-walled office decorated with Indian art .
His desk is made from a rosewood piano that belonged to his great-grandfather , the father of the firm 's founder .
Slightly built and balding , Mr. Piper is the embodiment of the firm 's culture : He is quick to smile , and he exudes a kind of Midwestern warmth .
Employees say he is the sort of boss who tells people they are working too hard and urges them to spend more time with their families .
As a child , Mr. Piper helped his father settle retail brokerage accounts during weekend visits to Piper Jaffray 's offices .
Every Christmas , his father would give him and his siblings stock in some of the well-known Minneapolis companies that the firm had taken public .
Among those Piper helped launch are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. and Pillsbury Mills Inc. .
`` From quite an early age , I was the kid who checked the paper to look up stock quotes , '' says Mr. Piper , who lives on a 70-acre farm west of the city .
He joined the family business full-time after graduating from Williams College and Stanford business school , and he succeeded his father as chief executive in 1983 .
About the same time , regional brokerage firms around the country were facing a common threat : The big local companies that had relied on them for financing needs suddenly began dealing with Wall Street firms offering more-sophisticated financial products .
`` The New York firms began flying into Minneapolis and taking clients that we had for 20 years , '' says Bruce C. Huber , the co-head of Piper Jaffray 's capital-markets group .
`` Playing golf with the client on Saturday does n't matter anymore .
'' In response , Piper Jaffray created an investment-banking practice that focused on a handful of industries nationwide rather than just local companies .
It also started an investment-management business that , until recently , has been successful by any measure .
Begun in 1985 , it now handles $ 12 billion .
`` We were late getting into it , '' Mr. Piper says , `` but it has become the fastest-growing part of our business .
'' Much of that growth was engineered by Mr. Bruntjen , who joined Piper in 1988 from Alliance Capital Management 's Minneapolis office .
At Piper , his biggest success was the Institutional Government Income Portfolio fund .
Until this year , the fund seemed a winner : Although investing in government-guaranteed securities , it produced extraordinary returns for a short-term bond fund .
Last year , it posted a gain of almost 16 % -- earning top ratings from both Morningstar Inc. and ValueLine Mutual Fund Survey .
And it bolstered Piper 's effort to build its asset-management reputation and attract clients .
`` Seven years ago , their money-management business was virtually nonexistent , '' says Eugene C. Sit , the chairman of Sit Investment Associates Inc. , a Minneapolis money-management firm .
`` This was their flagship , and it helped them sell the rest of their funds .
'' But Mr. Bruntjen 's expertise was in fixed-income securities , with a specialty in bonds backed by residential mortgages .
What helped achieve those stunning returns in recent years was his involvement in certain risky mortgage derivatives known as collateralized mortgage obligations .
Derivatives are instruments whose returns are linked to , or derived from , some other factor -- in this case , the rate at which homeowners repay mortgages .
Many of the CMOs favored by Mr. Bruntjen were supersensitive to changes in the pace of mortgage refinancings , a feature that made them behave like leveraged interest-rate options .
A veteran investor in esoteric mortgage bonds , Mr. Bruntjen boasted publicly of his ability to analyze them and use them to boost returns without undue risk .
When the CMOs began to fall in value as interest rates declined in 1990 and 1991 , Mr. Bruntjen boldly moved his portfolios into increasingly exotic mortgage derivatives .
The level of exotic derivatives in his portfolios started small but accelerated rapidly .
From zero in 1990 , exotics rose to 4 % of net assets in March 1991 , to 30 % by March 1992 and to an astounding 90 % by March 1993 , according to John Rekenthaler , the editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds .
A Piper spokeswoman disputes Morningstar 's calculation for March 1993 ; she says the derivatives were then equal to only 47 % of the fund 's gross assets .
`` The derivatives he used were inverse floaters , interest-only strips and principal-only strips , '' Mr. Rekenthaler says .
`` Those are the most exotic , most dangerous and most volatile of CMOs .
'' As the fund 's holdings in exotic derivatives increased , its character changed .
Far from being a traditional government bond fund -- relatively safe and relatively boring -- it became more and more a gamble on declining interest rates .
`` It was an enormous interest-rate bet , '' says Mr. Sit , whose firm handles $ 4 billion in investments .
Mr. Bruntjen , 58 , who declined to be interviewed , was almost certainly motivated by a desire to produce superior returns for his investors .
That , in turn , would attract more clients .
His pay was based not on the return generated by funds under his management but on the amount of those funds , says Edward J. Kohler , the president of Piper Capital Management .
Mr. Bruntjen 's aggressive strategy was remarkably effective until this year .
The Institutional fund returned 13.3 % in 1989 , 10.3 % in 1990 , 17.7 % in 1991 , 12.2 % in 1992 and 15.6 % in 1993 .
The 1993 return far exceeded that of any other short-term government fund followed by rating services .
And even though the value of the funds has declined this year , investors who went into them some time ago could still be well ahead .
But when interest rates began rising , the earlier outsized gains quickly turned into losses unprecedented among short-term bond funds .
While the value of all fixed-income investments , including U.S. Treasurys , declined as rates rose , the derivatives holdings account for most of Mr. Bruntjen 's losses .
The Institutional fund is off 23.3 % since the beginning of this year , according to Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. .
Mr. Kohler says the rest of Mr. Bruntjen 's investments , which totaled $ 3.5 billion at year end , fell a similar percentage .
After the losses began , mutual-fund executives were astounded to see Mr. Bruntjen continue to purchase the same derivatives that were decimating the value of his portfolios .
`` I am perplexed ; it must be overconfidence , '' says James Snyder , a portfolio manager at IDS Financial Services .
`` You would not expect someone with that kind of experience to not know what he was betting against or to not realize what kind of liquidity crisis there would be .
'' Mr. Kohler says Mr. Bruntjen continued to buy exotic derivatives even after their market value had begun to decline because he wanted all his investors to have basically the same portfolios .
Many investors say they had no idea that they owned such exotic instruments until the value of their investments began to tumble .
What they discovered was that the money they thought was in government securities was actually in securities derived from government securities ; among them were `` inverse floaters , '' an especially volatile derivative that rises in value as interest rates fall but fell by as much as 40 % as rates rose .
Although the Institutional fund 's prospectuses disclose that derivatives would be used , many investors say they had not understood that from their reading of the prospectuses and sales materials .
As a result , many investors are accusing Piper of distributing inadequate information and depicting the fund as a rock-solid investment rather than what it turned out to be : a souped-up bet on interest rates .
Mr. Kohler acknowledges knowing that a rise in rates would hurt Mr. Bruntjen 's portfolios but declares : `` We were not trying to make a huge interest-rate bet .
'' Mr. Piper adds : `` We did not view it as risky .
My own view is that we were doing the best job that we could .
We got caught in a market that we thought we understood .
'' Piper has n't reimbursed investors for losses , but it did invest $ 10 million of its own money in the Institutional fund as a show of confidence .
Mr. Kohler still voices confidence the fund will recoup its losses : `` These securities have recuperative powers .
Bond markets always rally .
'' Although many of Piper 's retail brokers blame its woes on Mr. Bruntjen , its executives continue to support him publicly .
`` Worth is a very knowledgeable and very sophisticated manager , '' Mr. Piper says .
But others suggest that the firm may be standing behind Mr. Bruntjen at least partly because he could be a damaging witness against it in the lawsuits that investors are filing in federal court here .
`` I think he has a lifetime contract , '' says a money manager at another local firm .
Lawyers for angry investors are seeking class-action status for several pending suits .
`` The sales materials were consistent with the oral representations : that this was a safe fund , just like a money-market fund , '' says Gregg M. Fishbein , an attorney for the plaintiffs .
Vernon J. Vander Weide , another plaintiffs ' attorney , says : `` The business about derivatives is buried in the prospectus .
Even there they never say this is unsafe as hell .
'' These lawyers , not surprisingly , contend that their case is strong .
The only flaw , they say , is that Piper may not have the resources to cover what they believe a court will eventually award .
`` I want to get as much as I possibly can , but I am not sure I want to be the lawyer who puts Piper out of business , '' says Richard A. Lockridge , another attorney .
Piper shareholders ' equity was $ 168.9 million at June 30 , and its total potential resources also include its insurance coverage , potential borrowings and claims that it might bring against other parties .
But regardless of the legal outcome , many rival fund managers believe that Piper eventually will have to reimburse investors for some of their losses .
`` Piper 's public stance is that everything was disclosed ; that 's just ridiculous , '' says Mr. Markman of Markman Capital Management .
`` This fund was not a risk-oriented vehicle .
You could tell by the people who bought the fund : municipalities , widows and orphans .
It was marketed as the safest product on their shelf .
'' Piper 's employees , who own about 60 % of its stock , have ample reason for dismay .
Like other securities firms ' stocks , Piper shares have been declining in recent months .
Yesterday , on unusually heavy volume , the stock plunged $ 2 a share to close at $ 11.625 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading .
Even if Piper avoids any legal liability , the loss of confidence in the firm will hurt it .
The more than 30 municipalities that invested in the Institutional fund could take their bond-underwriting business elsewhere -- a serious threat because Piper has handled about 40 % of Minnesota 's municipal underwriting .
In addition , the company 's 1,001 retail brokers `` are feeling the pressure , '' says Dan L. Lastavich , who heads its retail brokerage operation .
And Piper is n't launching several mutual funds that it had planned to start this year .
Piper says few investors have withdrawn their money from its management .
But the orchestral association , for one , is said to be already shopping for another money-manager ; a spokesman declines to comment .
For Piper , the distress at local charities may be especially embarrassing .
Mr. Piper , who is chairman of the local public-radio station and about to become chairman of a hospital that his family helped endow , says he devotes about six hours a week to charitable work .
While admittedly good for business , such work also is a family tradition .
Piper Jaffray was one of the first to adopt what has become standard for many Minnesota companies : giving 5 % of pretax profits to charity .
Mr. Piper says the firm undoubtedly will survive .
Recalling that it weathered the Depression `` only because of the good graces of some local banks , '' he feels sure that it will surmount this crisis .
In a conversation last week , in fact , he talked about his hope that some of his five children -- the oldest is 25 -- will go into the family business .
WOODBURY , N.Y. -- Cablevision Systems Corp. , one of the nation 's largest cable operators , said it will give certain sports channel subscribers rebates during the Major League baseball strike .
Cablevision customers who receive SportsChannel or the Madison Square Garden networks will receive rebates of at least 50 % , the company said .
Rebates will automatically be credited to customers ' October billing statements .
Cablevision serves 2.5 million subscribers in 19 states .
U.S. Electricar Inc. , a maker of electric vehicles , is setting up a manufacturing facility in Syracuse , N.Y. , to capitalize on growth prospects in the Northeast .
The company formed a joint venture with Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. , a Syracuse , N.Y. , utility , to create a site to assemble , market and maintain electric vehicles , most of which will be conversions of gasoline-powered , General Motors Corp. products .
The center will open early next year and will employ about 100 people .
It 's expected to produce about 3,500 electric vehicles by the end of 1996 .
U.S. Electricar , of Sebastopol , Calif. , annually assembles about 1,500 electric vehicles .
In the Northeast , U.S. Electricar will target managers of commercial fleets , who in 1996 face federal rules that require them to switch part of their fleets to vehicles that run on alternative fuels .
LONDON -- Willis Corroon PLC , a British insurance and risk management company , reported that pretax profit fell for the first half , reflecting continuing spending on group development and `` disappointing '' results in its U.S. broking unit .
Willis Corroon said continuing operations produced a profit of # 55.6 million -LRB- $ 86.4 million -RRB- , down 10 % from a year earlier .
`` This largely reflects continuing expenditure on group development and the disappointing results of our U.S. direct-broking operations , '' said Roger Elliott , executive chairman .
The total group result includes a net loss of # 1.5 million on discontinued U.S. and U.K. underwriting businesses , compared with a profit of # 1.1 million a year earlier .
Mr. Elliott said earnings per share on continuing operations fell 8 % , slowing from a 9 % fall in the first quarter , as brokerage and fee turnover rose faster in the second quarter than in the first .
Profit attributable to shareholders , after accounting for tax and minority interests , fell 16 % to # 32.5 million from # 38.6 million .
Expenses of continuing operations grew by 6 % , including spending on development of Willis Corroon 's North American direct , reinsurance , aerospace and construction-broking activities and on the establishment of offices elsewhere in the world .
Exchange-rate moves boosted results by # 3.7 million .
Cardinal Realty Services Inc. said it restructured $ 152 million in debt as part of a definitive agreement with the Resolution Trust Corp. for the resolution and modification of loans on 145 apartment properties , in which Cardinal has an ownership interest .
If loans for the properties , which have 9,368 units , are successfully modified , a $ 64 million reduction in the properties ' aggregate indebtedness is expected , said Cardinal of Columbus , Ohio .
The settlement also will fund operating reserves of $ 2.8 million and provide about $ 4.8 million for deferred maintenance on the apartment properties .
Cardinal said it also expected the dismissal of 75 partnership Chapter 11 cases in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on properties involved in the settlement .
The modified first-mortgage amount for the properties is $ 130 million , Cardinal said .
The subordinated debt totals another $ 22 million .
Closings will be staged on a property-by-property basis and are expected to be completed by Dec. 31 .
Cardinal is a real-estate firm that owns and manages apartment units housing 50,000 residents in 15 states .
In Abigail Thernstrom 's review of my book , `` The Shadow of the Panther '' -LRB- Leisure & Arts , Aug. 15 -RRB- , she incorrectly identifies Huey Newton as the speaker before a group of San Francisco lawyers in 1968 .
The speaker was Black Panther Minister of Information Eldridge Cleaver -LRB- Newton was in jail at the time -RRB- .
She also lists a group of celebrities as Newton 's supporters .
It would have been more accurate to list them as supporters of the Black Panther Party , particularly Norman Mailer and Susan Sontag , who in 1968 signed their names to a letter protesting the manner in which party member Bobby Hutton was killed by Oakland , Calif. , police officers .
Mr. Hutton was shot after the Black Panthers ambushed a police squad car at the urging of Eldridge Cleaver .
When they signed the letter , Mr. Mailer and Ms. Sontag were unaware that the party had ambushed the officers .
This was n't revealed until some years later by Eldridge Cleaver himself .
Though Ms. Thernstrom is essentially right in her analysis of my book 's conclusions about Huey Newton and his legacy , `` The Shadow of the Panther '' is as much about the Black Panthers as a whole and the atmosphere that set the stage for their legitimacy in the eyes of so many people , as it is about Newton , per se .
MADISON , N.J. -- The Federal Trade Commission has requested additional information from American Home Products Corp. and American Cyanamid Corp. as part of its antitrust review of the proposed deal between the companies .
The `` second request '' for additional information from the FTC indicates the deal is receiving more than routine governmental scrutiny .
Second requests are rare , said an FTC spokeswoman , but she cautioned against inferring too much significance from such actions .
American Home and American Cyanimid , of Wayne , N.J. , said they intend to respond to the FTC request promptly .
American Home 's $ 101-a-share tender offer for American Cyanamid shares expires Sept. 14 .
An American Home spokesman said the company is optimistic that the deal will proceed on its original timetable .
But a person familiar with the companies noted that if the FTC finds some antitrust problem , it can often take several months to resolve it .
The person pointed out that resolving governmental concerns about a product overlap has delayed completion of Roche Holding Ltd. 's acquisition of Syntex Corp , which was announced in early May .
The American Home spokesman said the FTC had requested information on areas where both companies had products , but he declined to specify the products .
Hemant Shah , an independent analyst , said there might be some product overlaps on the companies ' arthritis drugs , antibiotics and vaccines , but the products are generally old and any governmental concerns could be resolved by simply divesting the competing products to another company .
WHEN IT COMES to teenagers ' back-to-school wardrobes , parents fork over most of the money and take the teens to the mall , but they do n't necessarily have much say in what fashion statement their kids will make .
Mothers plan to spend an average of $ 311 on fall outfits , according to a national survey of 514 teenagers aged 12 to 17 and their mothers by Deloitte & Touche in New York .
Teens plan to spend just $ 79 of their money .
Sneakers and jeans are hot ; jackets -- even leather ones -- are not .
Although 76 % of teenagers expect to do most back-to-school shopping with their mothers , just 12 % say their family has the most influence on their clothing choices .
Only 15 % expect to do most of their shopping with friends , but 61 % say friends are their greatest fashion influence .
Mothers and teens also disagree about where to shop .
-LRB- Fathers were n't consulted ; only 3 % of teens said their dads were their most frequent shopping companion .
-RRB- Forty-six percent of mothers and 40 % of daughters prefer department stores over other retail outlets , vs. 32 % of sons .
Boys ' first choice for school gear is sporting-goods stores , at 33 % ; 2 % of mothers and 9 % of daughters preferred such retailers .
Daughters ' second choice for back-to-school shopping is specialty stores ; 31 % preferred them , compared with 11 % of mothers and 18 % of sons .
Thirty-eight percent of mothers prefer discount stores for back-to-school clothes , compared with 15 % of boys and 20 % of girls .
Kids , however , prefer shopping at discount stores for their school supplies .
Fifty-seven percent plan to buy most of their notebooks , pens and other necessities at those outlets .
THE CONVENTIONAL wisdom is that each generation of Americans is better-educated than the previous one .
But today 's young adults may reach middle age with less education than today 's middle-age baby boomers .
Statistics show that so far , young adults have lower educational levels than older adults .
Of those aged 25 to 34 , 87 % have a high school diploma or its equivalent , compared with 89 % of those aged 35 to 44 , according to the Census Bureau 's March 1993 Current Population Survey .
Twenty-four percent of those aged 25 to 34 have a bachelor 's degree or more , vs. 27 % of those aged 35 to 44 .
Some of today 's 25 - to 34-year-olds are still in school or will go back .
But if too few earn GEDs or college degrees in the future , this generation will end up with lower completed levels of education than baby boomers now in their mid-30s to mid-40s .
The pattern is slightly different for minorities .
Blacks aged 25 to 34 are just as likely as those aged 35 to 44 to be high school graduates , at 83 % , but they lag slightly behind older adults in their attainment of bachelor 's or higher college degrees , at 13 % vs. 15.5 % .
Younger Hispanics are more likely than those aged 35 to 44 to be high school graduates -- 60 % vs. 58 % -- but not quite as likely to have a bachelor 's or higher degree : 9 % vs. 10 % .
Many people in their early 20s are still in college , so it 's too soon to tell what their graduation rates will be .
But based on the share who have graduated from high school , this youngest generation may fall even further behind baby boomers in educational attainment .
In 1993 , less than 86 % of Americans aged 20 to 24 were high school graduates .
Even if the educational attainment of young adults falls off slightly , however , the attainment level of the adult population as a whole will continue to grow as the baby boom and following generations replace much less-educated older adults .
AMERICANS are n't as quick to wed as they once were , but most eventually tie the knot .
The median age of a first-time bride in 1993 was 24.5 years , according to the Census Bureau 's Current Population Survey .
The median first-time groom was 26.5 years old .
That 's a stark contrast to the century 's record lows in the mid-1950s , when half of men married before age 23 and half of women wed soon after their 20th birthdays .
The numbers also are higher than a century ago , when median ages for first-time brides and grooms were 22 and 26 years , respectively .
When people delay marriage , the share of singles grows .
In 1993 , 67 % of women aged 20 to 24 had never been married , up from 36 % in 1970 .
The share of never-married men in their early 20s rose to 81 % from 55 % over the same period .
Black women are more likely to put off marriage .
In 1993 , 22 % of black women aged 40 to 44 had never married , compared with 7 % of whites and 9 % of Hispanics .
In 1970 , the share was just 7 % , compared with 5 % for whites and 6 % for Hispanics .
Today 's elderly came of age when people married younger , and the proportion who have never married is very low .
Just 4 % of men and women aged 65 and older in 1993 have remained single all their lives .
But if today 's younger adults continue their patterns , that share will undoubtedly rise .
SOME SPORTS attract more crossover athletes than others .
According to the National Sporting Goods Association of Mt. Prospect , Ill. , 53 % of people seven and older who played baseball in 1993 also played basketball , and 30 % of those who played basketball also played baseball .
But just 5 % of bowlers go backpacking , and just 4 % of those who do aerobics go saltwater fishing ... Twenty-one percent of American physicians are foreign-born , finds an analysis of 1990 census data by Leon F. Bouvier and David Simcox , senior fellows of the nonprofit Center for Immigration Studies in Washington , D.C. Immigrants , who make up 8 % of the U.S. population , are well-represented in other professions .
They make up 15 % of postsecondary teachers , 13 % of those in natural sciences and 12 % of engineers .
The column by Alan Reynolds on Aug. 10 -LRB- `` Happy Birthday : Clinton Budget Is a Little Terror '' -RRB- contained misrepresentations about the economic performance of the U.S. economy .
Mr. Reynolds states that labor-force participation has been flat for the past seven months because of the `` punitive new marginal tax rates .
'' The Current Population Survey -LRB- CPS -RRB- was completely redesigned in January , and it is undergoing growing pains as new seasonal factors are developed and as the statistical community becomes familiar with its characteristics .
Relying upon a discontinuous data series that has been flat over the past few months after a huge surge in January seems disingenuous at best .
The series break occurs right in the middle of the period chosen by Mr. Reynolds for his analysis .
According to the more reliable payroll employment survey , nearly two million Americans have already jumped at the chance to get a new job this year -- solid evidence that labor markets are strong .
Mr. Reynolds goes on to claim that personal savings have fallen in the first half of 1994 as a `` predictable reaction to brutal taxes .
'' One of the most regular features of the kind of strong economic expansion that America has been enjoying during the first six quarters of the Clinton administration is a temporary decline in the savings rate , as consumers regain their confidence and replace aging cars and appliances .
In fact , the 1.7 percentage point decline in the savings rate from 1992 to the first half of 1994 was actually smaller than the decline in the savings rate that occurred in the early stages of the Reagan economic expansion in 1983 -- a period when sharply lower taxes were supposed to drive a supply-side savings miracle .
The real erosion of the savings rate took place over the decade of the 1980s -- during the Republican watch -- when federal government debt was allowed to quadruple .
Mr. Reynolds says productivity is slumping and is putting `` strong upward pressure on labor costs per unit produced , '' and that rising unit labor costs are squeezing profit margins .
Over the most recent four quarters , nonfarm business sector productivity increased by 2.6 % -- faster than the rate of annual productivity growth during the entire 1980 to 1992 period , with the exception of a single year .
Unit labor costs increased just 0.4 % over the most recent four quarters -- the smallest increase since 1965 .
And profit margins are soaring according to profit surveys , including the Aug. 15 survey on second quarter 1994 profitability by BusinessWeek .
Finally , Mr. Reynolds concludes that `` another year or two of noninflationary growth -LCB- looks -RCB- quite impossible .
'' On the contrary , solid and sustainable noninflationary growth is exactly what the Federal Reserve , the consensus of Blue Chip forecasters and most commercial economic forecasters are predicting for this period .
Despite the dire predictions of naysayers like Mr. Reynolds , the Clinton economic plan passed by Congress a little over a year ago has provided the fiscal foundation for a sustained expansion with subdued inflation .
Your thoughtful editorial `` Thou Shalt Not Kill , '' Aug. 2 , on the killings in Pensacola draws a suggestive analogy with antiwar activists in the 1960s who , in the name of a higher morality , took the law into their own hands .
Consider also the similarities with pre-Civil War abolitionists , such as John Brown , who justified killing slaveholders .
In each case -- abolitionism , anti-Vietnam activism and antiabortion protest -- the question posed is the justification of revolutionary action , including the use of lethal force .
In each movement an initially small faction concluded that action outside and against the system was required to fight the evil inherent in our political order .
William Lloyd Garrison and his fellow abolitionists publicly burned the Constitution , believing it to be `` a covenant with death and an agreement with hell .
'' Proponents of revolution in the 1960s contended that Vietnam was symptomatic of , not an aberration of , the American political and economic order .
Now , a few opponents of abortion have arrived at a similar conclusion with respect to the 1.6 million abortions performed annually .
Two decades of consistent survey research indicates that a majority of Americans believe abortion is murder or something very much like murder , but they do not know what , if anything , can be done about it .
The leadership of the pro-life movement insists that the evil of abortion on demand can and must be remedied within , not against , our political order .
They do not reject but invoke the Constitution in order to achieve their goal .
The outcome of the current conflict depends upon our political capacity to overcome the closure imposed by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade and subsequent decisions .
The abortion question can then be submitted to the deliberation and decision of the people , as prescribed in this representative democracy .
We must hope , we must pray , that this is possible .
As in the 1850s , and more than in the 1960s , the stakes could not be higher for our moral and political order .
NEW YORK -- Bond prices fell Thursday , as investors declined to help extend recent price gains .
There was no fresh news to trigger yesterday 's slide in prices , market observers said .
Instead , selling stemmed from disappointment that the market failed to sustain Wednesday 's rally and from a bearish turn in the technical state of the bond market .
However , observers warned against reading too much into the day 's declines , stressing that thin market conditions exaggerated the drop in prices .
`` We ` re experiencing some volatility this week , but the big picture has n't changed , '' said James K. Ho , who manages $ 2 billion of fixed-income funds for John Hancock Advisors Inc. in Boston .
In trading of Treasurys late yesterday , the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down slightly more than 7\/8 point , or $ 8.75 for a bond with $ 1,000 face value , at 99 16\/32 .
Its yield rose to 7.53 % from 7.45 % late Wednesday , reflecting the fact that bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices .
Donald Fine , chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc. , said Treasurys have settled back into their recent trading ranges .
While the market was n't able to extend Wednesday 's rally , it 's still supported by scattered buying interest , he said .
`` This bond has been trading in a range near 7.50 % for months now , and nothing has changed this week , '' Mr. Fine said .
`` The market is not going to move away from its recent range until we get conclusive evidence that the economy is improving or slowing down .
'' Treasurys started the day on the soft side , as investors took profits on positions to lock in price gains made after an impressive rally on Wednesday .
That selling translated into lower prices in both the Treasury cash and futures markets .
However , the big push lower came after the September bond-futures contract on the Chicago Board of Trade broke below the psychologically important 103.00 level , traders said .
They said a number of orders to sell positions were set at that level .
The September bond futures contract ended the session down 30\/32 at 102 12\/32 .
The bearish turn in the market 's technical environment was significant in Thursday 's session , analysts said .
The break of the 103.00 level on the futures contract took the market by surprise and could bode ill for Treasurys in coming sessions , they added .
Economic reports released Thursday did little to inspire trading activity .
The Labor Department reported that weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance dropped by 3,000 to 322,000 in the week ended Aug. 20 .
Separately , July existing-home sales fell 0.3 % to a 3.95 million annualized rate .
Both reports came in near market expectations .
With many bond-market participants on vacation and little this week on the economic-release calendar , participants think the likelihood of a market upswing remains limited and that Treasurys should consolidate near current levels .
But they generally remain positive about the market 's prospects after this week 's strong Treasury auctions and the firmer tone of the dollar .
`` There is a sense that conditions have improved , but larger accounts have been slow to come back into the market and are keeping money close to the vest , '' said Raymond Worseck , market strategist at A.G. Edwards & Sons , in St. Louis .
The recent increase in buying by institutional and retail accounts stems from the perception that the Federal Reserve will leave rates unchanged for the next two months , analysts said .
That has paved the way for accounts to re-enter the bond market , they said .
But investors said they are timing their purchases carefully , with many fearing the Fed will raise interest rates again later this year .
`` Retail accounts know they do n't have to chase the market higher , '' John Hancock 's Mr. Ho said .
`` Accounts are waiting for the market to break out of the range before getting involved .
'' The next challenge for the Treasurys market is today 's revision to second-quarter gross domestic product .
Many market partipants were forecasting an upward revision to 4 % from the initially reported increase of 3.7 % .
An unpleasant surprise in the GDP data , traders said , could cause Treasurys to extend yesterday 's losses .
Morgan Stanley Group Inc. sold $ 200 million of five-year notes through its underwriting unit , Morgan Stanley & Co. .
The issue was increased from $ 150 million because of strong investor demand , a Morgan Stanley syndicate official said .
Morgan Stanley 's issue was priced with a 7 1\/2 % coupon at 99.893 to yield 7.526 % , a yield margin or spread of 0.625 percentage point above Treasurys .
The noncallable issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and single-A-plus by Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group .
Separately , more corporations are said to be looking to sell step-up notes , or bonds with a coupon that increases each year .
Tuesday , Salomon Brothers Inc. sold $ 45 million of step-up notes .
Analysts estimate that about $ 900 million of step-up notes have been sold in the past four months by companies including PepsiCo Inc. , Xerox Corp. , Walt Disney Co. , AT&T Corp. and Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. .
Individual investors have gobbled up the securities , as they offer high current income and coupon protection in a rising interest rate environment .
`` Investor sentiment has changed , '' said Paul McGinn , a government and corporate bond trader at J.C. Bradford & Co. `` They 've gotten burned by bond mutual funds and they 're looking for safety .
'' But investors may not be getting the most bang for their buck with step-up notes sold by corporations , Mr. McGinn said .
He said federal agencies have sold such notes with comparable yields , and the interest income from some agency issues is exempt from state and local taxes , which further enhances the yield .
Federal agencies have issued step-up notes frequently in the past year , but often in larger amounts .
These have been bought by institutional investors .
Individuals seem more comfortable with a familiar corporate name -- and can buy the securities in units as small as a single bond -- even though federal agencies have the implicit guarantee of the federal government , an analyst said .
However , the actual maturity of such securities is n't clear .
Step-up notes usually can be called within three years .
If interest rates hold steady or climb moderately , many step-up issues likely will be snatched back from investors as soon as they can be called , because their coupons otherwise would rise dramatically .
Some observers say individual investors are n't getting enough yield to compensate them for the risk of the securities being called .
The bonds `` seem attractive initially , but when you start factoring in the step-up options , it 's not that great , '' says Marshall Cox , director of fixed-income at Bradford Investment Management in Nashville , Tenn. , who is n't buying the product .
If rates rise faster than expected , investors could find themselves owning the securities to maturity .
That uncertainty has led institutional investors to shy away from the notes , analysts said .
Institutional investors said they also are staying away because the secondary market for step-up notes is very illiquid -- as is often the case for new products .
Many step-up offerings are no larger than $ 50 million in size .
Institutions typically like to buy deals that are $ 100 million or more in size , and more likely to have greater liquidity .
About $ 1.8 billion of asset-backed securities was priced this session , including what underwriters say is the largest securitization ever of student loans .
Mortgage-backed securities ended about 1\/4 point lower in light trading , slightly lagging losses in Treasurys .
Banc One Corp. of Columbus , Ohio , sold $ 1.22 billion of student-loan asset-backed certificates in a three-part transaction through underwriters led by CS First Boston .
The largest class totaled $ 1.1 billion of five-year senior notes , priced at par with a coupon that floats 30 percentage points above the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate .
The cash influx will enable Banc One to fund loan growth , which is expanding on several fronts , said Richard D. Lodge , president of Banc One Funds Management Co. , a unit of Banc One .
In particular , the bank sees growth from a co-branded credit card soon to be launched with British Petroleum Co. .
Thursday 's transaction also buffers the bank in the event that the federal government 's effort to expand direct student lending pushes banks out of that market , he said .
Legislation passed this year will boost the government 's role in direct lending to students through colleges , rather than through local banks or thrift institutions .
Although direct government lending will apply to only 5 % of all students this year , it will expand to 40 % of all students by 1995 and to 60 % by 1998 .
Meanwhile , mortgages reversed course after a two-day rally that pushed prices 1\/2 to 3\/4 of a point higher .
Investors are showing a preference for the most liquid current coupon 8 % and 8.5 % securities .
Current coupon bonds are backed by the most recently created mortgage loans .
Municipal bonds were caught up in the selling that undercut Treasurys , with maximum losses of about 1\/2 point .
In one of this session 's primary-market highlights , the Federal National Mortgage Association won the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency 's $ 51.5 million single-family mortgage revenue bonds in competitive municipal-market bidding .
The government-sponsored entity 's bid set the true interest cost at 6.45 % .
Among actively traded issues , the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency 's 6.60 % of 2026 bonds were 1\/8 lower to 98 1\/8 to 98 1\/2 , yielding 6.71 % .
In the primary market , Atlanta 's $ 88.1 million of various general obligation improvement bonds were won by a J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. group with a bid setting the true interest cost at 6.12 % .
The bonds , rated double-A by both Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group , were priced for reoffering to yield from 3.60 % in 1995 to 6.18 % in 2023 .
The Maryland Stadium Authority 's $ 55 million Series 1994 convention-center expansion lease revenue bonds were won by a Lehman Brothers group with a bid setting the true interest cost at 5.7856 % .
Yields range from 4.40 % in 1997 to 6.00 % in 2014 .
Insured by Ambac , the bonds carry triple-A ratings from Moody 's and S&P .

WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats , admitting they lack the votes to enact health-care reform , agreed to allow a recess until mid-September while the party leadership keeps trying to reach a compromise with Republican moderates .
The abrupt shift contradicted Majority Leader George Mitchell 's oft-repeated vow to keep the Senate in session through the summer if needed to pass a health bill .
While still holding out hope of enacting incremental reform legislation this year , Democrats admit the delay leaves little time for Congress to reach agreement before the November elections .
`` Fewer people can stop more , as time grows shorter , '' said Sen. Christopher Dodd -LRB- D. , Conn. -RRB- .
Perhaps as important , the delay now takes the health issue off the Senate floor and into a nether world of negotiations from which some expect it will never re-emerge this year .
`` I believe we can get a good bill , '' Mr. Mitchell insisted after a party luncheon yesterday .
But these hopes rest on the Clinton administration and Democrats accepting a much more scaled-back version of health reform than previously proposed .
In fact , the altered schedule and promise of negotiations could prove to be an exit strategy for both sides , which want to avoid being seen as killing reform outright .
The expected return date for the Senate is Sept. 12 .
And the House leadership indicated yesterday that it would extend its recess correspondingly .
That leaves less than a month before lawmakers expect to go home again in October to campaign for re-election .
As a practical matter , it would require an immense effort to enact even a scaled-back reform bill in this period .
Mr. Mitchell , who is retiring this year , has made the issue a personal crusade of sorts .
But he must overcome divisions in his own party and an increasingly partisan Republican minority , which has shown no sign of relenting , as demonstrated by its record of opposition on the anticrime bill .
Many of the same GOP moderates with whom Mr. Mitchell is dealing sided with the administration yesterday in a pivotal vote on the anticrime legislation .
Sharp , even bitter remarks by Minority Leader Robert Dole -LRB- R. , Kan. -RRB- before the roll call were hardly encouraging that he would help to enact whatever compromise the moderates can reach on health care .
Chief among this group is Sen. John Chafee -LRB- R. , R.I. -RRB- , the Republican leader of the bipartisan `` mainstream coalition , '' which represents up to 20 swing votes on health care .
Mr. Chafee has ties to Mr. Mitchell through their years on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee .
The fate of the reform effort rests very much on the ability of these two men , who will meet today , to bring together colleagues on each side .
`` I still have some optimism , '' said Mr. Chafee , who argued the delay could be a boon if all sides cool off and allow some constructive talks .
In remarks yesterday , President Clinton sought to play down the impact of the Senate delay .
He faces major decisions himself as to how far he is willing to depart from his initial reform plan .
His best hope is to get some combination of insurance reforms and subsidies designed to move toward the goal of universal coverage .
But no one expects Congress to approve comprehensive health-care reform on the scale the president once envisioned , and even the reduced subsidies backed by Mr. Chafee are in question .
`` I do n't think doing nothing is a choice , '' said Sen. Thomas Daschle -LRB- D. , S.D. -RRB- , who hopes next year to succeed Mr. Mitchell and who has been a close ally of the majority leader in the reform effort .
`` I think it would be a big mistake to come halfway and say this is not enough .
'' Much the same view was taken by Vermont Gov. Howard Dean , who has been a leader among the nation 's governors on health-care issues .
To accommodate the governors , the mainstream group agreed in a meeting yesterday to modify its plan to better integrate Medicaid into a system of vouchers for lower-income families .
`` As a Democrat and very strong supporter of the president , this bill does n't go far enough , '' said Gov. Dean of the moderates ' plan .
`` As an American , we have to have a bill this year , and this is probably the vehicle to get it done .
'' The decision to incorporate much of Medicaid into the mainstream group 's plan will enlarge the subsidies included in it .
The moderates ' discussions with governors also relate to provisions governing what contributions states must continue to make to Washington , just as they currently share in the financing for Medicaid today .
These so-called maintenance-of-effort payments are extremely sensitive for governors .
Rather than impose a fixed formula , the moderates agreed to a provision that would tend to favor states whose medical costs rise slower than the national average .
By the same token , the mainstream proposal would achieve large savings by cutting payments to help hospitals that carry a disproportionate number of patients without insurance .
The assumption is that these payments wo n't be needed as subsidies are extended to many poor families .
But in fact , the proposed voucher system will be implemented only slowly from 1997 to 2004 , and even then , only households with incomes below 150 % to 175 % of the poverty line would be assured of any significant subsidy .
WASHINGTON -- Providing a longsought , hard-fought victory for President Clinton , Senate Democrats with some crucial GOP help approved anticrime legislation and sent it to him for his signature .
The way was cleared for the legislation when Democrats twice mustered more than the 60 votes needed to defeat GOP procedural moves to block the $ 30.2 billion crime bill , which Republicans claimed was laden with crime-prevention `` pork '' spending .
Six Republicans sided with the Democrats on the the first vote , which waived budget rules , and seven Republicans supported the second vote , which cut off debate on the legislation .
The final , 61-38 vote was an important win for the president , coming as his effort to restructure the nation 's health-care system is in critical condition .
However , the struggle to rescue the crime bill after a stunning setback two weeks ago in the House diverted valuable time from the health-care bill and helped weaken its prospects .
`` I want to salute the senators of both Republican and Democratic ranks who put law and order , safety and security , above politics and party , '' Mr. Clinton said last night after the bill 's victory appeared certain .
The importance of the legislation to the Clinton administration was underscored when Vice President Al Gore , still recovering from Achilles ' tendon surgery , took the presiding officer 's seat during one of the procedural votes .
The official duties of vice presidents include presiding over the Senate , but generally they appear only when votes are expected to be very close .
`` This is a good , strong , fair , balanced bill , '' said Sen. George Mitchell , the Democratic leader from Maine .
`` This is not about a defeat or a victory for any political party ... this is a victory for the American people , who have scarcely been mentioned during this debate .
'' Conceding defeat yesterday afternoon , Sen. Robert Dole , the Republican leader from Kansas , said : `` We 're going to lose , but win with the American people .
It 's going to demonstrate that we need more Republicans elected in November .
'' Though Senate Republicans were unable to get their desired amendments -- reduced crime-prevention spending , tougher mandatory minimum sentences and stronger prison provisions -- House GOP members did force the administration to accept similar changes after the House had voted two weeks ago to block consideration of the bill .
They knocked 10 % off an earlier , $ 33 billion version , with nearly two-thirds of the cuts coming from the crime-prevention budget .
The House then approved the revised version 235-195 on Sunday .
The legislation going to the president 's desk provides $ 23.3 billion for law enforcement and incarceration .
It partially funds 100,000 state and local police officers , extends capital punishment to 60 federal offenses , provides $ 9.9 billion for state prisons , and mandates life terms for three-time violent felons .
About $ 6 billion would fund crime-prevention programs ; the GOP sought to eliminate $ 5 billion of that .
Crime prevention includes such programs as drug treatment , economic development , employment and educational programs .
A $ 380 million local crime-prevention block grant replaces 10 prevention programs listed in the original legislation , programs that still could be funded at local discretion .
Those programs include midnight basketball , Boys and Girls Clubs in public housing , youth anticrime councils , and gang-prevention efforts .
A highly controversial measure bans 19 specific semiautomatic assault weapons and so-called copycat models .
That provision was a major factor in delaying passage of the crime bill in both the House and Senate .
Even after Senate Republicans offered to take their objection to the measure off the negotiating table , Democrats said the GOP plan to open the bill on other amendments was partly a subterfuge to kill the bill and the weapons ban .
One part of the legislation everyone seemed to support was the provision on violence against women ; among other things , it would make interstate domestic violence and interstate stalking a federal crime .
It also allows victims of crimes that were motivated by sex to sue the attacker in federal court , regardless of whether criminal charges were pressed .
Under the bill , those convicted of violent sexual offenses must register their addresses with state officials for life and verify their locations every three months .
The legislation permits law-enforcement officials to notify a community that an offender is living in the area .
Sen. Joseph Biden -LRB- D. , Del. -RRB- , who as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee was the principal author of the crime bill , said he was most pleased with the violence-against-women provision .
`` It will truly make a difference to the lives of women who are being battered , '' he said .
`` More women will be alive next year than this year , '' because of the bill .
There was strong Clinton administration lobbying for the bill -- too strong in the eyes of Republicans .
Sen. Dole opened the debate by saying Justice Department officials had warned assistant U.S. attorneys , who sought no weakening of a mandatory minimum provision , that they faced criminal prosecution if they campaigned on the bill .
Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern said representatives of the National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys were told that federal law prohibits federal employees from representing any individual or organization doing business with the government .
`` They 're certainly free to make their point '' as individuals , Mr. Stern said .
`` There 's been no threat here to quiet them .
'' Brian Flood , executive director of the association , agreed .
`` No one in this association has been threatened with reprisals or prosecution for weighing in on the crime bill , '' he said .
Amid all the serious debate , Sen. Alfonse D'Amato -LRB- R. , N.Y. -RRB- demonstrated his belief that the bill is laden with social-spending `` pork .
'' Standing in front of a picture of a big , pink pig eating dollars in a trough , Sen. D'Amato sang a version of `` Old MacDonald Had a Farm .
'' His Republican colleague , John McCain of Arizona , suggested Sen. D'Amato get voice lessons .
And Sen. Alan Simpson -LRB- R. , Wyo. -RRB- , always ready with his Western wit , predicted that once the American people learn what is in the legislation , `` they 'll blink like a frog in a hailstorm .
'' NEZAHUACOYATL , Mexico -- Miguel Angel Ibarra , whose thick neck is festooned with golden chains , struts around in a manner that befits a militant in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party -LRB- PRI -RRB- .
It 's election day in this upwardly mobile but decidedly poor community of about two million just on the outskirts of Mexico City , and Mr. Ibarra has been assigned to get out the PRI vote .
Under the watchful eyes of voting booth officials , Mr. Ibarra pretends to check if the ballot boxes are sealed , or jokingly chides voters who he suspects are voting for the opposition .
Even these actions are in violation of Mexico 's new election laws .
But as the votes are finally being counted at the end of the day , Mr. Ibarra 's antics do not distract officials from their duties .
Though the PRI wins the count , opposition party representatives are satisfied that both the count and the secrecy of the voting process have been honorably executed .
They each sign several copies of the `` acta , '' which documents the count for that booth and attests to the honesty of the voting process .
Mr. Ibarra 's actions were the most egregious violations I could document in a full day of touring different voting booths in this community , known as Neza for short .
But they were not enough to upset the voting or the final count , and it is in poor communities like this where the PRI has historically exercised its greatest power as a dominating political machine .
Last Sunday 's election did much to break the hold that individuals like Mr. Ibarra had on the popular will .
But not all vestiges of political machinery were wiped out in the campaign .
Media outlets that rely on government concessions for air time heavily favored coverage of PRI presidential candidate -LRB- and Sunday 's winner -RRB- Ernesto Zedillo .
There is also much evidence that government programs like Solidarity , which are supposed to be strictly nonpartisan , are held out as political favors to communities that vote with the PRI .
One woman whom I visited last year in Neza reports that a Solidarity representative recently refused to help fund a community street paving project unless her neighborhood voted for the PRI .
`` We 've gone a long way toward solving the electoral problems , '' says Rene Delgado , a political analyst for the Reforma newspaper .
`` But there are still a lot of political problems .
And the main one is separating the government from the PRI ... not only to remove the influence of the PRI from government institutions , but also from unions , the business community and even the army .
'' In an interview with The Wall Street Journal yesterday , President Carlos Salinas admitted that while his administration had made progress in separating the PRI from the government , `` it has to go much further '' in this direction .
`` The PRI needs people who work full time , and do n't go jumping between the PRI to government and back again , '' he said .
He produced as evidence a letter from a mayor in Oaxaca requesting federal assistance in various areas .
The letter was written on PRI stationery .
`` We have a cultural symbiosis that we have to work very hard to end .
'' When told of the woman in Neza who had been advised to vote for the PRI in exchange for Solidarity assistance , the president said : `` I would like the name of this guy , and he will go to jail .
'' Still , since Mr. Zedillo received such a large popular mandate -- just over 50 % , with Diego Fernandez of the conservative National Action Party -LRB- PAN -RRB- coming in second at 28 % -- the PRI is under no great pressure to change more quickly .
In fact , while the overall election results are not seriously contested , some suspect that there may have been some last-minute `` fine tuning '' to boost Mr. Zedillo 's count to just over 50 % .
The government insists that the results of the election were completely transparent .
But members of the opposition and the independent media have so far not been allowed to compare their copies of the polling booth `` actas '' with those held by the supposedly neutral Federal Election Institute -LRB- IFE -RRB- .
Regardless of how the PRI deals with the remnants of its past , one meaning of this election can not be lost on all the political parties : An overwhelming majority of Mexicans -- 78 % -- cast their vote for the two political parties that favor the continued modernization of Mexico .
Those parties that were viewed as advocating a return to more statist policies -- in particular , Cuauhtemoc Cardenas 's PRD , which received just 17 % of the vote -- were soundly defeated .
This has led to quite a bit of soul searching among PRD supporters , some of whom now wonder whether their party will survive at all .
`` Cardenas realized three months ago that anti-Nafta and anti-market rhetoric was n't working , '' says Andrea Dabrowski , a former Time magazine correspondent who joined the Cardenas campaign last year as international press coordinator .
`` But we were never able to change the initial impression that Cardenas represented a socialist ideology .
'' Ms. Dabrowski worries about Mexico 's political stability without the PRD .
`` Cardenas was the glue that kept the radical elements within the political system , '' she says .
`` I wonder into what the movement will dissolve .
'' Some have suggested that the leader of the militant Chiapas rebellion , Subcomandante Marcos , could emerge from behind his mask and take over for the defeated Mr. Cardenas .
Indeed , at a Cardenas rally in Mexico City 's main square on Monday , chants of `` Viva Chiapas !
'' and `` Viva Marcos !
'' were shouted frequently .
Such an outcome might actually solve two problems for the PRI : keeping the radical elements within the political system , and disarming Marcos .
Even President Salinas in his interview yesterday said , `` Marcos would be welcome into the political process -- as long as he laid down his weapons and got rid of his mask .
'' On the other hand , with a 78 % mandate against the left , some political commentators worry that Mr. Zedillo may opt for taking a hard line against Marcos and his Zapatistas -- demanding that they turn themselves in or face being crushed by the army that now surrounds them .
Ultimately , neither political maneuvering nor open repression will be successful at marginalizing the radical elements in Mexico .
Only the continued modernization of the political system and renewed economic growth will do that .
Relics of the old system remain , but they have far less power to control than they once had .
When I asked a PRD representative at the Neza voting booth whether he felt Mr. Ibarra 's actions would sway the vote , he answered : `` Mexican people can separate fools who work for a party from what that party means for Mexico .
The best thing is that people like Mr. Ibarra are no longer making our decisions for us .

Many apparel-retailing stocks have been disappointments , but some investors say J.C. Penney has been punished excessively .
Even after earning a record $ 940 million for the year ended Jan. 29 , the big department-store chain has languished on Wall Street .
Its Big Board-traded stock is 16 % below the past year 's high , and the 28 Wall Street firms following Penney have given the stock nearly as many lackluster `` neutral '' ratings as buys .
Which is exactly why Scott Black of Delphi Management is buying Penney shares .
The Boston `` value '' investor , who manages $ 635 million in assets , rarely buys large retailing stocks , preferring instead to search for beaten-down smaller stocks .
But he says he sniffs a value in Penney and bought a total of 90,000 shares in late July and in August , including some this week .
This is noteworthy because Mr. Black 's stock-picking decisions have been good lately ; he is up nearly 6 % for the year , well above the market averages .
`` I think for a large-cap stock , it 's a pretty good company that 's not been given much respect , '' says Mr. Black , who bought his shares at between $ 47 and $ 48 , a bit below yesterday 's close of $ 49.75 .
There is no reason , he argues , that the stock should be selling at its current level of about 10 times his estimated per-share earnings for next year of $ 4.85 , `` when a lot of junk '' in other industry groups trades at higher multiples .
Investors also are heartened that the Plano , Texas , company has been buying its stock .
It announced plans to buy as many as 10 million shares , but has purchased only about three million so far .
The company wo n't say if and when it will buy more .
Penney trades at 12 times the past year 's earnings .
That price\/earnings multiple is lower than such `` broadline '' retailers as Dillard Department Stores , May Department Stores , Dayton Hudson , Sears and Wal-Mart Stores -LRB- the most highly valued of the group , with a P\/E of 23 -RRB- .
Penney , which also sells bedding , bath items , curtains and household goods including furniture , is n't a slave to fashion trends like some other apparel retailers .
And it has a flourishing catalog business , which represents 18 % of total sales and got a shot in the arm from the catalog pullback made by Sears .
Indeed , one reason that Mr. Black got turned on to Penney is its decision last year to begin accepting the Discover Card .
It was a bid to woo shoppers from Sears , which created the card but whose Dean Witter Discover unit now is independent .
`` It has worked out very well , '' says a Penney spokesman , though he concedes : `` We ca n't verify exactly who the Sears customers were .
'' Penney , with its low P\/E and 3.5 % dividend yield , is `` a very good value , '' says Wayne Stevens of Duff & Phelps Investment Management , which holds two million shares .
Varilyn Schock of Blue Chip Value Fund adds that the company 's once-drab clothes have improved .
`` It 's not a place you do n't want to walk in to anymore , '' she says .
Moody 's Investors Service has put Penney 's long-term debt under review for possible upgrade .
Moody 's is still doing its review , but when it announced the study on July 27 , Moody 's cited the retailer 's `` continued strong earnings and cash-flow performance .
'' Of course , investors in Penney and other retailing stocks have been let down before .
Although everyone keeps waiting for a pickup in apparel sales , it has n't happened yet .
The broadline-retailers group of the Dow Jones Equity Market Index that includes Penney and the other above-named stocks , along with Kmart and Woolworth , is down 6 % for the year to date after falling an identical percentage in 1993 .
The group had soared 63 % in 1992 .
Penney 's sales-growth rate of 7 % to 8 % does n't excite too many people , but that misses the point , say the bulls .
Penney , with 1,246 stores nationwide , is already in all the major markets and sees little reason to expand rapidly in the U.S. .
The company says its real growth will come in the future in international markets , such as Mexico .
There is another reason that you might be hearing better things about Penney .
Yesterday , for the first time , the company invited every Wall Street analyst who follows it to Plano headquarters .
Though only 28 major analysts follow it , 100 showed up for the Facts & Food session .
`` We hosted them all , '' a Penney spokesman says happily .
LOS ANGELES -- Bob Dylan , the singer and songwriter , is suing Apple Computer Inc. for allegedly using his last name for a new software program .
The suit , filed in federal District Court in Los Angeles , says Apple is `` publicly touting a product called ` Dylan ' '' after previously telling Mr. Dylan 's lawyer that the use of the singer 's name was merely an in-house designation .
The suit also says that Apple is intentionally using the names of famous people `` including Newton , Carl Sagan and now Dylan in conjunction with Apple 's products in a deliberate attempt to unlawfully capitalize on the goodwill associated with these famous individuals .
'' Apple , Cupertino , Calif. , declined to comment on either the suit or on whether it is developing a product named Dylan .
The company has been known to designate computer models in the development stage with the names of famous people -- a practice traditionally considered an honor .
But Mr. Sagan , the noted astronomer , did n't think of it that way .
He complained to Apple when he heard that a project was code-named Sagan -- and then sued earlier this year after company employees allegedly gave the project a new , derogatory label .
Mr. Sagan 's suit was filed in federal District Court in Los Angeles .
WEST BADEN , Ind. -- `` Al Capone got kicked out of the French Lick Hotel and then he started coming here , '' guide Tracy Shupe tells a group touring the 92-year-old West Baden Springs Hotel .
In the 1920s , the famous and the infamous frequented the opulent hotel here and the resort in neighboring French Lick .
Joining Chicago 's best-known gangster , such luminaries as John J. Pershing , J.M. Studebaker and the Vanderbilts took the waters and enjoyed the pleasures of illegal gambling .
`` It was a fabulous time around here , '' remembers 86-year-old Russel Bledsoe , who was a casino dealer .
Guests `` would come up and play golf , take their baths , drink in their rooms -LRB- because it was Prohibition -RRB- , and then go try their luck .
'' Today , the structure hyped as the Eighth Wonder of the World when it opened in 1902 is a wreck that has n't been operated as a hotel since 1932 .
But new owners , Minnesota Investment Partners , want to bring back those good days .
Grand Casinos Inc. , of Minneapolis , which has an option from the owners to buy the property -- says it will spend about $ 60 million restoring the building , provided it is allowed to operate a casino .
Most people in this town of 697 seem to like the idea , because it promises economic revival .
But it is n't the sort of revival Michael Weiss , a lay preacher , and the Rev. William Benner , of Springs Valley Christian Church in French Lick , are hoping for .
They are appealing to a higher authority to keep things as they are .
`` We 're asking God to bring a loss of $ 100 for every dollar invested in the project , '' says Mr. Weiss .
`` We 're asking that he make it impossible to legalize gambling , that he remove politicians supporting gambling , and that he bring division and animosity among the groups involved .
'' The two men are carrying that prayer list all over town , warning the community of the evils of a casino .
`` It will bring destruction , both financially and morally , '' says Mr. Benner .
It is too soon to know just how their prayers will be answered .
Casinos are illegal in Indiana except on water -- rivers and lakes -- and then they must be approved by county referendum .
The nearest body of water to West Baden is Patoka Lake , 11 miles away , which is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers .
Casino sponsors plan to apply for a license to run games on Patoka Lake , not that they actually want to do that .
If voters approve the plan , the casino folks will try to transfer the license to the hotel .
Then Grand Casinos would put a lake in front of the hotel .
`` They can flood the old golf course , '' says Billy Jones , who is in charge of the building 's security .
`` There 's a creek there now , but when we need it to be a lake , it will be a lake .
'' Most people here , whatever their views on gambling , support the project because it means restoring the hotel .
`` The only possibility of saving it seems to be a casino , '' says state Rep. Jerry Denbo , of French Lick .
He does n't object to the gambling trade-off .
Mr. Benner tells his congregation that a casino would destroy the quality of life in this hilly , corn-growing region of southern Indiana .
But vice is already part of the idyllic picture , some say .
`` We 've got prostitutes here , we 've got drugs here , '' says Mr. Jones .
All that will change , he says , is that `` we 'll reap the tax benefits '' of gambling .
Neither Mr. Benner nor Mr. Weiss is a West Baden native , locals like to point out .
Mr. Benner moved here 10 years ago to become postmaster of French Lick .
Mr. Weiss arrived just three years ago .
`` People who pass through here have no right coming here telling us what to do , '' says Ruth Dickey Marshall , president of the West Baden Historical Society , a group founded in 1988 to save the hotel .
Besides , she adds : `` This was not a den of sin when we had gambling before .
'' While most of what drew people to the hotel has long since been removed by owners , vandals , and wear and tear , a visitor today still sees a magnificent dome -- 135 feet high and 208 feet in diameter -- with 10,000 panes of glass .
According to the Indiana Historic Landmarks Foundation , it was probably the world 's largest `` clear-span '' dome before the Houston Astrodome was completed in 1965 .
The building , which is in the National Register of Historic Places , on weekends draws about 100 visitors a day willing to pay $ 5 and sign a waiver of liability should the walls come tumbling down .
It is hard to visualize today , but in its heyday in the '20s , the atrium under the dome was the scene of circuses , car shows and conventions .
The two fireplaces that warmed the space could accommodate 14-foot logs .
And 12 million pieces of mosaic tile laid by Portuguese workers covered the floor .
The surrounding building had a post office , bank , barber shop , shoe store and stock exchange .
The hotel , built in 200 days at a cost of $ 414,000 , had a bowling alley , a billiards room and sunken gardens .
Each of 708 very advanced guest rooms had a private bath , running water and steam heat .
As many as 14 trains a day dropped off guests at the front door .
Ruthann Ginder , who recently got her family to drive the 150 miles from Anderson , Ind. , to tour the building , says , `` It 's sort of like if you were able to go down and see the wreckage of the Titanic .
It 's in ruins , but you still can see the grandeur of what it used to be like .
'' Grandeur is what Grand Casinos will restore , says Stan Taube , its executive vice president .
`` We 'd like to bring back some of the nostalgia , '' he says .
`` I can just imagine , from a marketing point of view , what a story it could create .
'' Messrs. Benner and Weiss , the men of the cloth , argue that a casino would do no more for locals than create a few minimum-wage jobs .
The hotel `` was built on filthy money , '' insists Mr. Weiss .
`` Should God just want it to sit there and rot , that 's fine with me .
'' But some people here think of jobs as their salvation .
County unemployment last year was 8.9 % , according to the state Employment Security Division .
Mr. Taube expects to know by next June whether the project will go forward .
If it does , the West Baden Springs Hotel could reopen in 1996 .
`` Right now , we are going to church and saying a lot of prayers that the gaming thing does go through , '' says Norman Kerr , chief executive of Minnesota Investment Partners .
Two out of three ai n't bad .
When picking a mutual fund , you have to consider three main questions .
First , will the fund generate good results ?
Second , how much will you have to pay to get that performance ?
And finally , how wild will the share-price gyrations be along the way ?
The good news is , two of these three questions can be answered pretty easily .
The bad news is , it 's extraordinarily difficult to get a fix on the most important issue -- a fund 's future performance .
`` People spend 90 % of their time thinking about which funds are going to perform well and 10 % worrying about everything else , '' says Gerald Perritt , editor of the Mutual Fund Letter , a Chicago newsletter .
`` That means you spend most of your time on the imponderable , and not nearly enough time on other things that matter long term .
You 've got to be looking at risk and cost .
'' In an attempt to find future top performers , most investors look for funds that have done well in the past .
But , unfortunately , funds with good records often stumble .
Consider the case of American Heritage Fund .
The stock fund , which ranked as the top-performing mutual fund for the three years through last December , plunged 29.4 % in this year 's first seven months , making it the fund industry 's second-worst performing fund .
Past performance is a better guide to future results with bond funds than with stock funds .
But even among bond funds , there are some notorious disasters .
Piper Jaffray Institutional Government Income Portfolio , for instance , was the top-performing short-term government-bond fund between year-end 1990 and year-end 1993 .
But this year , the Piper , Jaffray Cos. ' fund has ranked as the worst-performing bond fund , with a loss of 23.5 % through July .
Because future fund performance is so difficult to forecast , fund analysts suggest spending at least as much time considering a fund 's cost and risk level , which can be predicted with far more certainty .
`` The last thing I look at is performance when I pick a fund , '' says Geoffrey Loynd , a financial planner in Marblehead , Mass. `` The first thing I look at is cost .
I want to make sure I get a low-cost fund .
That stacks the odds in your favor .
'' All mutual funds incur annual expenses , and some also charge a sales commission when you buy or sell the fund .
These costs are disclosed within the first few pages of a fund 's prospectus , which is the official sales document that gets sent to all prospective investors .
Using the prospectus , a fund 's costs are easy to predict , analysts say .
The sales charge probably wo n't change .
The annual expenses will vary slightly from the figure published in the prospectus , though the difference should n't be significant unless the fund boosts its management fee or there is a big change in the amount of money the fund has under management .
Published mutual-fund results already reflect the impact of annual fund expenses , though they do n't usually take into account a fund 's sales commissions .
Because hefty fund costs can drastically reduce your returns , Kenneth Klegon , a financial planner in Lansing , Mich. , advocates buying no-load funds with modest annual expenses .
Diversified U.S. stock funds charge an average of 1.3 % in annual expenses , while taxable bond funds levy around 0.9 % .
`` On the bond side , you should be paying significantly less than the average bond fund , '' Mr. Klegon says .
`` On the stock side , it may make sense to pay a little bit more for a superior manager .
You 'll also pay more for an international manager or an emerging-markets manager .
'' Avoiding high-expense funds is especially critical when picking a bond fund , says John Bogle , chairman of Vanguard Group , the giant Valley Forge , Pa. , fund complex .
Mr. Bogle estimates that , among bond funds with a similar investment objective , differences in annual expenses probably explain 75 % of the variation in performance .
`` There 's no realistic chance that the quartile of bond funds with the highest expenses could beat the quartile of bond funds with the lowest expenses , '' he says .
Just as future mutual-fund costs can be predicted with some accuracy , so is it possible for investors to get a pretty good handle on a fund 's future risk level .
How ?
Simply look at the fund 's historical share-price gyrations .
A fund 's risk is often measured by analyzing its performance in bull and bear markets or by looking at two measures that reflect the month-to-month variations in a fund 's results : `` beta , '' which shows how much its value fluctuates relative to the market as a whole , and `` standard deviation , '' which shows how much its monthly return can stray from its average return .
This information is published by some mutual-fund newsletters , and it may also be available from the fund itself .
Scott Lummer , a managing director with Ibbotson Associates , a Chicago investment-consulting firm , notes that the wildness of a fund 's share-price swings will vary depending on how choppy the market is .
But he says that the relative risk level of different funds tends to remain fairly constant .
For instance , equity-income and growth-and-income funds usually give investors a smoother ride than growth funds , which in turn are typically more stable than aggressive-growth and small-company stock funds .
Mr. Lummer warns , however , that this pattern can break down if a fund manager strays from his investment style .
Understanding a fund 's relative risk level is important so that you do n't buy into more risk than you can stomach , then bail out when the going gets tough .
`` Risk matters because you need to build a portfolio that you can live with through thick and thin , '' says Mr. Perritt , the newsletter editor .
`` Dumping your investments when they 're underwater is probably the worst mistake individual investors make .
'' To earn decent returns , you have to take risks , by putting a healthy portion of your portfolio into stocks and by buying more aggressive funds , such as foreign-stock funds and small-company stock funds .
The secret is not to overdo it .
One way to make owning these riskier funds less unnerving is to hold them as part of a diversified portfolio that includes a mix of stock and bond funds that tap into a variety of market sectors .
As for performance , the fact that you ca n't predict it does n't mean that you should ignore past performance altogether .
`` There is some relationship between past performance and future performance , '' says Ibbotson 's Mr. Lummer .
`` But unfortunately it 's not a matter of picking funds that finished in the top 10 % for the past three years and expecting that they 'll be there again in the next three years .
'' Roger Ibbotson , president of Ibbotson Associates , looked at stock-fund performance for the period 1976-87 .
He found that funds that ranked in the top 25 % of their category during the past three years had a better than 60 % chance of being in their category 's top half during the next three years .
Mr. Ibbotson and Mr. Lummer are currently updating the study through yearend 1993 .
William John Mikus , a managing director with Los Angeles money manager Financial Design , advises buying funds that have performed well compared with funds that use a similar investment style .
He says you should check that the fund manager responsible for the fund 's record is still at the fund 's helm and that the fund 's long-term record is n't built on just one or two years of spectacular performance .
Mr. Mikus also says he prefers funds that have been around for at least three years and that have more than $ 200 million in assets .
If you find a top-performing fund that meets all those criteria , can you be sure it will continue to generate top-notch results ?
Mr. Mikus does n't offer a whole lot of hope .
`` Even then , there are precious few guarantees , '' he says .
NEW YORK -- International Business Machines Corp. stock closed in on the $ 70 mark yesterday , a high Big Blue has n't seen in almost two years , giving Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. a paper profit of nearly $ 11 million on his options package .
IBM closed at $ 69.375 , up $ 2 , on volume of 5.3 million shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
IBM last saw $ 70 in October 1992 , as the stock spiraled down from a high of $ 175 in July 1987 as IBM 's difficulties worsened .
For Mr. Gerstner , who joined the company a little over a year ago , yesterday 's closing price means a paper profit of $ 10.8 million on 500,000 options .
He received the options to buy stock at $ 47.875 a share when he took over the ailing computer giant in April 1993 .
In addition , Mr. Gerstner has bought 50,000 shares on the open market in 13 separate purchases since joining IBM , paying from $ 41 to as much as $ 62 .
The current rally in IBM shares started last month , when IBM 's second-quarter earnings showed exceptional progress on the cost-cutting front .
`` There 's a growing sense that this is n't a one - or two-quarter financial engineering game being played , '' said Thomas Rooney , of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette .
He has had a `` buy '' recommendation on the stock since last November , when it was selling at $ 45 a share .
ROME -- Employment at Italian industrial companies with more than 500 workers fell 5 % in May from a year earlier , and was down 0.1 % from April , the state statistical office Istat said .
The figures do n't depart markedly from the trend of the first four months of the year .
The May decline principally involved blue collar workers and apprentices , down 6 % .
Clerks and white collar employment fell 3.3 % in May .
Employment fell 2.6 % in the energy , gas and water sector and 4.1 % in the metal-working group .
The number of hours worked rose 4.9 % in May .
There was one additional working day during the month than in May 1993 .
NEW YORK -- Renewed selling in bonds deflated Wednesday 's enthusiasm , leaving stock prices moderately lower .
After soaring 70.90 on Wednesday to its highest level since March 23 , the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 16.84 , or 0.44 % , to 3829.89 .
Broad-based indexes also lost ground , and declining issues led gainers 1,122 to 1,057 on the New York Stock Exchange .
The Nasdaq Stock Market , though , managed to rise .
Sharply higher prices among technology issues buoyed Nasdaq trading , after Wall Street analysts made positive comments about several individual stocks .
Big Board volume reached 284.1 million shares , a moderately active pace , but was down from 309.8 million Wednesday .
Stocks in general remained far more buoyant than the bond market .
The 30-year Treasury tumbled slightly more than 7\/8 point , or $ 8.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount , lifting its yield to 7.53 % .
A gain of nearly a point in long-term bonds was a primary impetus for Wednesday 's rally in stocks .
Joseph McAlinden , chief investment officer at Dillon Read & Co. , said the divergence in the performance of the two markets is part of a process under way all year as evidence has amassed showing strength in the economy .
A stronger economy raises the threat of inflation and higher interest rates , the enemies of bond traders .
Stocks also are hurt by the possibility of higher rates , but they are helped by the promise of stronger earnings from an improving economy .
`` Stocks are two-variable instruments , while bonds are just one-variable instruments , '' said Dillon Read 's Mr. McAlinden .
The Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index lost 0.95 , or 0.20 % , to 468.08 ; the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.43 , or 0.17 % , to 258.18 ; and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index shed 0.70 , or 0.16 % , to 442.82 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index , though , rose 3.08 , or 0.41 % , its third straight gain and its eighth in the past 10 sessions , to 754.80 .
The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index slipped 0.86 , or 0.19 % , to 447.12 .
Even with yesterday 's loss , the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains above its June high of roughly 3,815 .
The average neared that level several times during July and early August but was unable to pass it again until Wednesday .
International Business Machines jumped 2 to 69 3\/8 on Big Board-leading volume of 5.3 million shares .
A Wall Street Journal article detailed the strong turnaround to profitability achieved by the Armonk , N.Y. , company 's microchip unit .

Recent concerns about a slowdown , he said , were unfounded .
Digital Equipment jumped 1 1\/4 to 24 1\/4 , while Oracle -LRB- Nasdaq -RRB- added 1 5\/8 to 43 1\/4 .
Oracle , based in Redwood Shores , Calif. , is said to have agreed to acquire Digital 's database-software business for $ 100 million .

Walt Disney lost 1\/2 to 42 3\/4 .
Jeffrey Katzenberg , chairman of Walt Disney Studios , said he will leave the Burbank , Calif. , company when his contract expires at the end of next month .
He has been viewed as one of Hollywood 's top creative executives .
Bowater rose 7\/8 to 28 after Smith Barney upgraded its investment opinion on the shares to `` neutral .
'' It had assigned the Greenville , S.C. , paper manufacturer 's stock an `` underperform '' rating .
American depositary receipts of Bell Cablemedia -LRB- Nasdaq -RRB- jumped 2 1\/2 to 21 1\/2 .
Analysts attributed the move to a U.K. regulatory decision Wednesday that may help communications companies like Bell to take customers away from giant British Telecommunications .
ADRs of that company lost 5\/8 to 60 .
Novell -LRB- Nasdaq -RRB- increased 7\/8 to 15 5\/8 .
The Provo , Utah , computer-networking-software concern had income from operations of 21 cents a share in the fiscal third quarter ended July 30 , up from 15 cents before charges a year earlier .
Eric Miller , a market strategist at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette , does n't expect the Dow Industrials to fall back and become stuck beneath the June high again .
He predicted that the average will approach its all-time high of 3978.36 between now and year 's end , but he does n't expect that record to be topped .
Naf Naf SA , a French retail clothing company , said it acquired rival brand Chevignon , combining two of the country 's leading youth clothing lines .
Naf Naf said the acquisition fulfills its aim of complementing Naf Naf 's mainly women 's clothing with a product geared toward men .
Naf Naf declined to give financial details of the transaction ; it plans to disclose those at its annual shareholders meeting Monday .
With 120 stores in France and 13 elsewhere in Europe , Naf Naf is aiming for 238 stores by 1995 , with 58 abroad and 180 at home .
Chevignon specializes in clothing with a western and vintage U.S. theme .
MEXICO CITY -- The federal attorney general 's office said it foiled an attempt to sell counterfeit Mexican bonds with a total face value of $ 11 billion that had been printed in the U.S. and brought into the country .
None of the bonds were actually sold , the authorities said .
Manuel Galen Jiminez , spokesman for the attorney general , told reporters the alleged plot had been under investigation since the Finance Ministry detected the forgeries in May 1991 .
Two men have been arrested .
Mr. Galen also said four U.S. citizens designed , printed and intended to sell pagares , or bank promissory notes , for $ 11 billion of Mexican foreign public debt .
He said the four men brought the false documents into Mexico where their Mexican partners , including the two men arrested , had them notarized to make them appear official .
SUNNYVALE , Calif. -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said it is considering Dresden , Germany , as the site for a major new manufacturing plant .
A spokesman for the semiconductor maker confirmed that the company has held discussions with officials in Saxony , the region where Dresden is located .
He said no decision has been made about whether or where to build the plant .
Fullsize chip factories typically cost more than $ 1 billion , though the spokesman would not confirm German news reports that said the proposed plant would cost $ 1.2 billion and employ 1,400 workers .
Advanced Micro has been seeking additional manufacturing capacity to meet expected demand for its K5 microprocessor , which begins shipping next year .
ARLINGTON , Va. -- Charles E. Smith Residential Realty Inc. said it completed the acquisition of The Manor , a 435-unit garden-apartment property in Montgomery County , Md. , for $ 20.3 million .
The World 's Greatest Deliberative Body planned to recess last night and begin a summer vacation , after three Republicans blinked in a showdown over the crime bill .
The issue is whether Majority Leader George Mitchell will succeed in getting them to blink again on health care , or whether they 'll use the break to listen to constituents .
Polls find two-to-one support for Congress waiting until next year to tackle health care .
But Senator Mitchell persists in a bare-knuckled effort to pass a partisan bill , and can be forgiven for thinking that will work .
His partisan stubbornness allowed him to outmaneuver the Bush Administration for four years on everything from tax increases and civil rights to the Clean Air Act .
When George Bush did fight for a capital gains tax cut in 1989 , Senator Mitchell blocked it after it had passed the House and had the votes to clear the Senate .
After a series of parliamentary stalls he pulled a late-session filibuster .
The capital gains defeat helped bring on what we dubbed the `` Mitchell Recession , '' which contributed so much to George Bush 's defeat .
This week Senator Mitchell and his allies nonetheless had the nerve to attack the budgetary objections raised by Republicans to the crime bill .
Massachusetts Senator John Kerry called it the most blatant attempt to injure a President he 's seen in his 10 years in office , evidence of either his short memory or blind partisanship .
Senator Mitchell succeeded in intimidating enough Republicans into supporting the crime bill on the key procedural vote yesterday .
Of the six Republicans taking his side , three -- Senators John Chafee , John Danforth and Nancy Kassebaum -- had signed a letter only two days before assuring Minority Leader Bob Dole they would back him in his effort to open the crime bill up to amendment .
In the end , they could n't stand to be accused of `` perpetuating gridlock .
'' Some GOP Senators seem genetically incapable of staring at their Democratic counterparts in confrontations and not blinking first .
The Republicans who voted with Senator Mitchell on the crime bill may also be prominent in the health care endgame .
The danger now is that while President Clinton and Senator Mitchell have lost the intellectual and public opinion battles on health care , they can use the Republicans who helped them on the crime bill to secure a partial victory .
Everyone now understands that a plan to reorder one-seventh of the economy can never pass in the cold light of day , but Mr. Mitchell 's goal during the Senate 's recess will be to negotiate with Senator Chafee and the so-called `` mainstream '' senators , and then propose a `` summit '' on health care .
Senator Chafee and the other `` mainstreamers '' will be under enormous pressure to stay in the room until something President Clinton is willing to sign is agreed to .
And after a closed-door summit sometime in October , with Members anxious to get home and campaign , Mr. Mitchell hopes to present them a take-it-or-leave-it proposition : Vote for a confusing mess of a health bill or be attacked for contributing to `` gridlock .
'' Somehow we do n't think it will work .
Members will get an earful back home over the next 10 days , and it wo n't be demands that they pass a health bill cooked up in secret and understood by only a few people .
We doubt that Americans want a health bill passed with crime bill tactics .
If they make that clear to their elected officials while they 're back home , then the awful crime bill will have served a useful purpose : saving the country from a truly disastrous health care experiment .
NEW YORK -- Optimism about U.S.-Japan trade talks bolstered the dollar against the yen yesterday , but the currency retreated against the mark under the weight of a slide in the U.S. bond market .
In late afternoon New York trading , the dollar was quoted at 1.5430 marks , down from 1.5461 marks late Wednesday in New York .
The U.S. currency also was changing hands at 99.70 yen , up from 99 yen .
Sterling was trading at $ 1.5555 , up from $ 1.5530 .
About noon Friday in Tokyo , the dollar was trading at 1.5435 marks and at 99.75 yen ; sterling was at $ 1.5535 .
The dollar was higher for most of the day in a continuation of a rally that began Wednesday .
But the advance started to run out of steam early in the European session after the market repeatedly tried but failed to push the dollar through resistance at around 1.5500 marks .
With little chance of pushing the dollar higher against the German currency , it began to slide as the U.S. bond market moved sharply lower .
`` There really is n't much reason to buy the dollar right now , '' said David Solin , a partner with Foreign Exchange Analytics in New York .
He said the market saw the dollar 's inability to break above 1.5500 marks as `` an opportunity to take a couple of pfennigs profit .
'' After rising strongly on Wednesday , Treasurys ran into a technically driven sell-off that pushed up the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond to 7.53 % late Thursday from 7.45 % a day earlier .
But the dollar moved higher against the yen amid more optimism about the progress of U.S.-Japan trade talks .
Japan 's Finance Ministry said yesterday that it hopes for a successful conclusion to talks aimed at opening Japan 's insurance market to foreign competition .
Japanese and U.S. officials met in Seattle earlier this week to review the issue , though it 's unclear how much progress was made .
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 's office said the Seattle talks had been useful , but added that more discussions on insurance will be held Sept. 8 -- when Mr. Kantor is to meet in Los Angeles to discuss a range of trade issues with ministers from Japan , the European Union and Canada at the so-called Quad meeting .
The insurance talks are separate from the discussions on reforming Japanese government-procurement practices for telecommunications and medical equipment .
The U.S. has said it may impose sanctions on Japan if an agreement is n't reached in those areas by Sept. 30 .
An unidentified White House official said yesterday that the U.S. would like to see a breakthrough in the wider trade negotiations with Japan at the Quad meeting , and that the U.S. is more interested in reaching an agreement with Japan than in imposing sanctions .
Despite the optimism on the trade front , some traders expressed reservations .
`` The market is cautious , '' said Jim Donovan , a trader at Daiwa America Corp. , though he added that speculation that the U.S. and Japan will reach agreement was helping the dollar .
`` But the market is n't ready to commit all its gunpowder to going long on the dollar , '' Mr. Donovan said .
`` Even if there is an agreement on insurance , there are still some big issues hanging over the market , '' Foreign Exchange Analytics 's Mr. Solin said .
He added that the market may push the dollar lower against the yen ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline that may trigger sanctions against Japan , but said the U.S. currency is unlikely to fall significantly .
Iced coffee may not be just for summer anymore , thanks to a jury in Albuquerque , N.M. .
Last week it awarded Stella Liebeck , 81 , $ 2.9 million in damages for burns she suffered after spilling a cup of McDonald 's coffee on herself .
Never mind that she was holding the coffee between her legs and traveling in a moving car at the time of the mishap .
Usually , we would suspect a trial lawyer to be at the root of such an award .
But after reading this quote from a juror , we have to wonder .
`` The coffee 's too hot out there , '' she said .
`` This -LCB- just -RCB- happened to be McDonald 's .
'' We 've often championed the common sense of the average citizen over a regulatory bureaucracy , but decisions like this make us scratch our heads .
MAYNARD , Mass. -- Digital Equipment Corp. said it signed an agreement with Microsoft Corp. under which Digital will provide customer support for Microsoft products .
Digital said that under the pact , its 29 support centers in 100 countries will deal with Microsoft 's units to provide `` mission-critical '' support services for corporate customers .
Digital will provide installation and start-up services , user-support services , help-desk support services and training on Microsoft products .
NEW YORK -- Nynex Corp. asked the Justice Department to lift a decade-long ban blocking it from the long-distance telephone market so it can handle calls originating in New York state , arguing that competition in the state is robust enough to warrant letting it loose .
`` We recognize that competition in the local exchange market is developing in many parts of the country , but in New York we 've got it .
It 's here , '' said Frank Gumper , Nynex 's managing director of federal regulatory affairs .
New York is one of only a few states that allow companies to provide local phone service in competition with the hometown Bell .
The state Public Service Commission has authorized almost two dozen companies to provide a variety of services in competition with Nynex , the White Plains , N.Y.-based regional Bell company that provides telephone service in parts of the Northeast .
All three major long-distance companies -- AT&T Corp. , Sprint Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. -- have the authority to provide local as well as long-distance services throughout the state , although they have n't yet actually offered local service in competition with Nynex , the Baby Bell said .
John Hoffman , senior vice president of regulatory affairs for Sprint , criticized the plan , saying , `` We do n't agree that local competition actually exists in New York .
'' Nynex , which has about $ 13 billion in annual revenue , claims it is losing about $ 100 million a year to competitors for some lucrative business services .
But it retains a virtual lock on the local telephone market .
Nynex 's Mr. Gumper concedes that the Bell firm still has almost 100 % of the local phone market , but he said Nynex should n't have to wait around for full-fledged competition to materialize .
The New York market provides about 60 % of Nynex 's annual revenue .
In the lucrative New York City market , Nynex is facing probable competition for local phone customers from Time Warner Inc. 's cable company , while on Long Island a cable firm , Cablevision Systems Corp. , also is expected to offer phone service eventually as part of its cable television package .
Even if Nynex wins the Justice agency 's support , it still must pass muster with U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene , who oversees the consent decree that broke up the Bell System a decade ago .
The decree bans the Bells from the long-distance market .
Nynex , along with three other Baby Bells , recently launched a major attack on the consent decree , filing a motion urging the judge to eliminate it entirely .
Computer wholesalers keep making Pomeroy Computer Resources Inc. offers it ca n't refuse .
Competition for the business of the Erlanger , Ky. , regional computer dealer is so intense that Pomeroy has dropped its allegiance to a sole wholesaler .
Now it buys from whichever one offers the best deal .
`` We 're kind of in a nice position right now , '' says Frank Friedersdorf , vice president of sales .
`` We ` re being courted by all the major players .
'' While dealers like Pomeroy are smiling , the wholesalers that sell to them are pining for the good old days , when profit margins were high and dealers were locked in to exclusive agreements .
Instead , an explosion of competition this year among wholesalers -- the middlemen of the computer trade -- has caused an expensive scramble for dealers ' business .
The competition has prompted predictions of a shakeout and consolidation .
`` It 's a war , and there 's going to be bloodshed , '' says Mark Cuban , a partner in Eureka Ventures , a technology-investment firm .
On Wall Street , the bloodletting among wholesalers has already been severe .
Since March , Intelligent Electronics Inc. is down 44 % , InaCom Corp. shares have fallen 52 % , Tech Data Corp. has dropped 58 % , Merisel Inc. has declined 61 % and MicroAge Inc. , which sold an additional two million shares at $ 21 in June , has plunged 63 % in five months .
What has changed ?
Formerly , when sought-after machines made by market leaders -- such as Compaq Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. -- were in short supply , the manufacturers managed the shortages by requiring a dealer to buy through only one wholesaler .
Middlemen , able to charge high markups , prospered .
Now that shortages are disappearing , however , big manufacturers in their zeal to gain market share have begun to allow dealers to buy from multiple sources .
And profits for some wholesalers are vanishing .
In addition , both Compaq and IBM now let major corporate customers buy directly from them , further adding to the unrest .
Manufacturers say they are only doing what they must to keep pace with competitors .
`` We 're just giving customers the opportunity to be better satisfied , '' insists Ronald Schneider , Compaq 's director of channel management .
`` Competition is very , very keen right now .
'' Industry executives and analysts agree that only the strong wholesalers will survive .
`` What we are seeing are Darwinian effects , '' says Seymour Merrin , a former computer dealer who now runs a market-research firm .
Adds Greg Pratt , president of Intelligent Electronics , one of the largest wholesalers : `` I absolutely am convinced this industry is going through a rapid consolidation -- like any other industry would as it matures .
Too many marginal players think they can make profits up later .
But my thinking is there wo n't be a later .
'' Mr. Pratt thinks his company -- which is well-capitalized -- will be one of the strong gobbling up the weak .
Indeed , recently it was rumored to be making overtures to InaCom .
He wo n't comment except to say , `` I can tell you I 'm not in the middle of a transaction .
'' Bill Fairfield , InaCom 's president and chief executive officer , says there never were talks .
`` The company is n't for sale , in whole or in part , '' he says , adding that InaCom , too , intends to be a buyer .
Some wholesalers have already begun broadening their roles in search of an edge .
`` Aggregators '' such as InaCom , Intelligent Electronics and MicroAge -- which rely on high volume and low cost , and which specialize in cobbling together complete computer systems for buyers -- are broadening their narrow product lineups .
Meanwhile , `` distributors '' such as Merisel , Tech Data and closely held Ingram Micro Inc. -- which have traditionally offered much wider variety -- are shaving profit margins to go head-to-head with aggregators .
The crossover was triggered by Merisel , which decided to get into the aggregator business itself with its $ 110 million February acquisition of the ComputerLand name and franchised retail system .
Analysts say the purchase , thus far , has proven to be expensive -- especially after Merisel was forced to withdraw a secondary stock offering that had been intended to repay bank borrowings .
But Merisel says the acquisition was a solid move because the company now offers dealers the best of both worlds -- the product lineup of a major distributor , and the aggregator services of ComputerLand .
Ingram Micro has followed that approach by launching its own aggregator business , prompting Martin D. Wolf , president of Merisel 's ComputerLand division , to claim : `` We have an 18-month jump on the competition .
'' Such branching out has stirred discontent among dealers , who now find their distributors competing with them at the retail level .
To smooth those ruffled feathers , as well as to keep dealers from bolting to rivals , wholesalers have aggressively cut prices .
Merisel 's gross profit margin dropped to 6.8 % in the second quarter from 8.3 % a year earlier .
Even though sales in the period rose nearly 70 % , net income fell 55 % .
MicroAge said its operating-profit margin in its fiscal third quarter , which ended July 31 , was only 1.1 % of revenue , down from 1.8 % in the previous quarter .
Sales grew 49 % , to $ 583.4 million from a year earlier , but earnings were below expectations .
MicroAge says it sees no relief in sight .
`` We believe that recent price competition will continue to have an impact on margins during the next quarter , '' said Jeffrey D. McKeever , its chairman and chief executive officer .
InaCom said its fiscal second quarter , which ended June 25 , was its worst since the company became publicly traded in 1987 .
The firm reported a $ 7.9 million loss , or 77 cents a share , and cited pricing pressure as one reason .
Intelligent Electronics , too , is cutting margins .
`` I ca n't sit by and let people poach '' the dealers his company serves , Mr. Pratt says .
The result will be that weaker players drop out , analysts say -- either by getting acquired or going out of business .
`` Those that ca n't keep pace will fall by the wayside , '' says James Meyer of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. .
When the dust settles , analysts expect the survivors to prosper .
Sales continue to grow briskly , and Mr. Merrin says companies like Intelligent Electronics , Ingram and Tech Data are effective and efficient .
`` Unequivocally , there will be a rebound among the strong players .
But we maybe have another quarter to go , '' he says .
But some wonder if it will take longer .
`` The distribution business is a tough business by nature , '' says Amor Towles , research director at Select Equity Group .
`` But right now , it 's tougher in the PC industry than in any other .
'' Consumers Union 's Aug. 19 letter in response to Larry Katzenstein 's Aug. 8 editorial-page piece `` Consumers Union Credibility -- Good but Slipping '' is itself a typical example of the aggressive campaign that Consumers Union -LRB- CU -RRB- is waging to scare American families away from milk , one of the most nourishing foods in our diet .
The scientific facts simply do not support its claims .
In December 1990 , the Food and Drug Administration 's Center for Veterinary Medicine reviewed a CU policy report on recombinant bovine somatotropin -LRB- rBST -RRB- and milk safety and found a `` number of inaccuracies and misstatements in the report .
'' An 18-page letter to CU from Dr. Gerald Guest , then director of the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine , outlined and corrected the major scientific inaccuracies upon which Consumers Union has based its position .
Claims that milk from rBST-supplemented cows contains pus and antibiotic residues clash with the findings of the leading health and science organizations .
What does Consumers Union know that the Food and Drug Administration , the National Institutes of Health , the Office of Technology Assessment , the American Medical Association , the American Academy of Pediatrics , the American Dietetic Association and the World Health Organization do n't know ?
These organizations have determined that milk from rBST-supplemented cows is perfectly safe for human consumption .
Milk from rBST-supplemented cows is exactly the same -- in taste , smell and nutritional value -- as milk from other cows .
All milk is monitored through extensive FDA , state and industry programs that test for residues of antibiotics and for unapproved , or `` off-label , '' medicines .
If the tests show antibiotic residues , the milk is destroyed and sanctions are imposed against the offending dairy farmer .
This monitoring system protects consumers from antibiotic residues in their milk .
The Dairy Coalition , which represents the majority of U.S. milk producers and processors , is committed to educating consumers about the safety of our nation 's milk .
We do not support nor oppose the use of rBST .
We do oppose inaccurate and unsubstantiated claims about milk .
The `` public concern '' referred to in the Consumers Union letter is the very concern that it generates with scare tactics .
We agree with Mr. Katzenstein that this group has `` turned from exposing fearmongers to becoming one itself .
'' HONG KONG -- The world of Asian investing may appear gloomy to Hong Kong 's `` Dr. Doom , '' but even he sees a few rays of sunlight filtering down to high-yield Indonesian bonds and Russia 's Far East .
Marc Faber , the Hong Kong-based investment adviser and fund manager known here for his pessimistic predictions , lives up to his nickname with his current advice : `` Take a nap .
Do nothing .
'' But when pressed , he suggests that investors who do n't feel sleepy might try some high-yield Indonesian bond issues ; Russian equities , especially in the country 's Far East ; and his longtime favorite : North Korean debt .
He also recommends , for safety 's sake , throwing in some good old three - to five-year U.S. Treasurys and German government bonds .
Dr. Faber -- who turned bearish on the Hong Kong market in mid-1993 , missing out on a surge in the Hang Seng Index in the second half of the year-bases his dire predictions for the region 's stock markets on an impending flood of new issues .
`` Suddenly the world situation has changed from generating surplus cash and surplus liquidity to seeing an unbelievable demand for capital from the developing world , '' he explains .
`` Every country in Asia has a flood of new issues waiting : If the market conditions are bad , they can postpone the issues .
But they will still be waiting to come , so I do n't see how markets can go up .
'' Dr. Faber 's admonitions may seem as ill-heeded as those of the mythical Cassandra , as investors scramble for ways to make money in one of the world 's fastest-growing regions .
But many investors world-wide take his advice seriously .
`` He commands respect for provoking people to look at new areas , '' says Robert Lloyd George , chairman of Hong Kong investment-management firm Lloyd George Management , who finds some of Dr. Faber 's advice worth following .
Marc Faber Ltd. , Dr. Faber 's Hong Kong-based company , has about $ 120 million of institutional money under management , including about $ 20 million in the unlisted Iconoclastic International Fund , which seeks out offbeat investment opportunities .
The fund 's net asset value has risen to $ 16.40 in July from $ 10 at its launch in May 1991 ; it 's up 14 % so far this year .
Dr. Faber says his successes include calling the October 1987 market crash and recommending the Latin American debt and equity markets in the late 1980s , before they really took off .
`` And , '' he boasts , `` I did n't lose money in 1994 '' as many markets tumbled .
Dr. Faber currently dismisses most Asian stock markets as overvalued ; he says investors seeking Asian exposure would be better off buying high-yielding bonds such as a recent international offering from Indonesian pulp and paper group PT Pabrik Kertas Tjiwi Kimia .
Tjiwi Kimia International Finance Co. .
BV , a Netherlands-based unit of the Indonesian group , raised $ 200 million this month through an offering of seven-year bonds with a coupon of 13.25 % , which at the time of issue represented a yield 6.32 points higher than the return on sevenyear U.S. Treasury bonds .
That reflects the `` junk , '' or subinvestment-grade , credit ratings of the paper-single-B-1 from Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and double-B from Standard & Poor 's Ratings Group .
Lead manager CS First Boston says the bonds , initially sold at a par value of $ 100 , currently trade at 101 to 101.50 , yielding 13.01 % to 12.9 % .
That still puts Tjiwi Kimia 's bonds at the top of the yield scale for recent Indonesian bond issues .
At yields of 13 % or more , Tjiwi Kimia 's bonds pose a viable alternative to the company 's stock , Dr. Faber says .
Dr. Faber also is known as a fan of North Korean debt , which has risen from about 16 % of face value at the start of the year to a high of about 27 % .
Recently , North Korean loans have traded at 19 % to 20 % of face value , but Dr. Faber expects it to appreciate to 50 % or more within the next four to five years , triggered , for example , by an improvement in North Korea 's economic situation or in relations with the U.S. and South Korea .
Lately , Dr. Faber 's enthusiasm has been caught by publicly traded shares in Russia and other former Soviet republics .
In May , he launched the Firebird Fund L.P. , which started with $ 15 million and has seen its investments appreciate by about 50 % ; the value of its stake in Surgutneftegaz Oil & Mining Co. , a Siberian oil company , has risen fourfold , he says .
Dr. Faber 's company also holds about 1.5 % of the shares in Commercial Port of Vladivostock on Russia 's Pacific coast , which Dr. Faber predicts will assume increasing importance as a center for Russia 's trade with Japan and South Korea .
The shares trade on Vladivostock stock exchange .
The Firebird Fund , which requires a minimum investment of $ 100,000 , is aimed at wealthy individuals with a steely disposition : Investing in Russia is n't for the risk-averse .
Trading is illiquid and information on companies is difficult to obtain , short of paying personal calls on management .
The country 's combination of high inflation and political instability provides little cheer to most investors .
But Dr. Faber sees this as a good buying opportunity .
`` When we went to Russia , we saw all the problems , and we saw that share prices were very , very cheap , '' he says .
Control of health-care costs may be stumping Congress , but growing numbers of small-business owners think there is at least one answer .
They are following their big brothers into managed-care plans .
The broad move is documented in a study that Johnson & Higgins Inc. , a New York insurance broker , expects to release Monday .
The company 's Foster Higgins consulting unit surveyed 979 businesses -- each with fewer than 1,000 employees -- and found that 49 % offered some type of managed-care plan last year , up from 44 % in 1992 .
Several years ago , few small companies offered the plans , says Rick Elliott , who oversaw the study for Johnson & Higgins .
In contrast , 72 % of larger employers offered at least one managed-care plan last year , says an advance copy of the study .
In interviews , executives at some small companies say their recent switches to managed care are already yielding significant savings .
That 's a huge relief to entrepreneurs for whom soaring health costs have been a major concern -- often outstripping all others in surveys of what they worry about .
Officials at Dixon Ticonderoga Co. , a Maitland , Fla. , pencil maker , have determined that the company 's health-care claims costs have dropped about 20 % since they adopted a managed-care format in May 1993 .
About 600 of the company 's 1,000 U.S. employees are in managed-care plans , says Richard A. Asta , chief financial officer .
Rik D. Lindahl , a Dallas principal of the accounting and consulting firm KPMG Peat Marwick , says it is not unusual for an employer to save between 10 % and 15 % by switching to a managed-care plan , all other factors being equal .
The Johnson & Higgins study credits the swing toward managed care only with slowing the rise in health-care costs for small businesses that embrace it .
Small companies ' average health-care costs per employee rose 6.2 % last year to $ 3,308 , the study says .
Harder to quantify , however , is the amount of unhappiness felt by some employees when they lose conventional health coverage .
After being forced into alternative plans , such as health-maintenance organizations , many employees no longer can choose their own doctors .
But proponents of managed care say that without such plans , many small employers might not be able to offer any kind of health benefits to workers .
Big companies began turning to HMOs and other managed-care programs about a decade ago -- pushed by rapidly rising costs and pulled by heavy marketing efforts by managed-care providers .
Smaller employers began making similar moves several years later .
`` It 's taken a little while for them to get up to speed , '' says Mr. Elliott of Johnson & Higgins .
Most small-company executives until recently were unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the vocabulary of managed care , he says .
But now they have learned the terms , and are racing to catch up with larger companies , he adds .
The upshot is that some now offer employees a choice between conventional coverage and an alternative plan -- but many others force employees to switch to managed care .
According to the Johnson & Higgins study , the proportion of small employers offering so-called indemnity plans dropped to 57 % last year from 61 % in 1992 .
Such plans generally allow employees to use doctors of their choice and then to seek reimbursement .
By contrast , HMO members , for example , use only doctors belonging to the HMO .
Benefits consultants say an important factor in small concerns ' rush to managed care is that more insurance companies are wooing them .
Until recently , `` the product availability for small employers had not been of the diversity and quality that larger employers had , '' says Cynthia M. Stamer , a Dallas health-care attorney .
Vanderbilt Health Plans Inc. , a Nashville , Tenn. , company owned by Vanderbilt University , recently started an HMO by targeting small employers in central Tennessee .
Thomas Nagle , president of Vanderbilt Health , expects the HMO to grow to almost 3,000 participants by the end of the year , up from 300 currently .
Under managed care , insurance companies negotiate deep discounts for medical care from physicians and hospitals .
Patients who use providers in the network typically are rewarded with lower out-of-pocket expenses .
Insurance companies encourage providers to keep hospital stays short and take other measures to reduce the costs to both the employer and the insurer .
Still , some employers and employees worry that managed health care means less choice for patients .
Almost one-fifth of indemnity-plan sponsors in the Johnson & Higgins study said they are `` committed to unrestricted choice of providers .
'' Partly because of resistance to HMOs , some health-insurance specialists report rising small-business interest in other types of plans within the managed-care universe .
Preferred-provider organizations , or PPOs , are growing in popularity , for example .
Such plans offer discounts to employees who use physicians -LRB- belonging to the plan -RRB- but generally are less restrictive than HMOs .
Of the small employers in the Johnson & Higgins study , 24 % offered PPO plans in 1993 , up from 21 % in 1992 .
Employee-benefits consultants say the next cost-trimming measure for small companies will be another tactic pioneered by larger employers : strict management of special benefits such as drug prescriptions , prenatal care and mental-health care .
In 1993 , only 6 % of small employers offered separate drug-benefits management , the study says .
But even with the increased availability of the plans to small companies , many workers will continue to go without employer-sponsored health insurance of any type .
`` Many small employers are going to continue to choose not to buy health insurance because it 's very , very expensive , '' says Stephen D. Brink , a consulting actuary with Milliman & Robertson in Milwaukee .
SENATORS ' DEPARTURE leaves Democrats scrambling for a political theme .
The decision to send the Senate home for Labor Day without acting on health care leaves Democratic candidates in limbo .
The health logjam shows voters that `` special interests and partisan politics have too much influence , '' says Democratic pollster Mark Mellman .
Democrats emphasize victory on the crime bill and blame the GOP on health .
Above all , they will stress local issues .
Republicans have problems , too .
While good at frustrating Clinton , GOP operatives acknowledge they still lack a clear national theme .
Gingrich hopes to treat that by bringing all GOP House candidates together on Sept. 27 to agree on a platform of 10 initiatives .
But that effort prompts internal tussles ; hard-liners and moderates disagree over how harsh a welfare plan to back .
Democrats see some bright spots , such as the improved standing of New Jersey Sen. Lautenberg .
STEPPING BACK : Hillary Rodham Clinton lowers her profile -- temporarily .
She made calls to some House members on the crime bill but takes a back seat in the Capitol Hill health debate .
The first lady spends more time with daughter Chelsea , joining her for a tea and a bike ride .
She gives new chief of staff Panetta plenty of room to cement his position , playing no role in the staff changes he plans to make .
But the first lady is likely to become more active again in the election season .
Administration aides say she is in great demand among Democratic candidates at all levels .
One exception is the South , where she is less popular , and her appearances will be carefully targeted .
White House officials and Mrs. Clinton 's aides are at work on a campaign schedule .
HIGH-TECH spending fares better in Congress than `` putting people first .
'' Early estimates show Senate appropriations bills give Clinton nearly 62 % of his `` investments , '' while the House gives 56 % .
The Commerce Department gets a 16 % budget increase .
The National Institute of Standards and Technology sees its budget more than double , to $ 855 million from $ 344 million .
People programs are n't so lucky .
A big White House disappointment is Head Start , where Clinton sought a $ 700 million increase but gets just $ 200 million .
The president also gets less than he wanted for his Goals 2000 education initiative , partly because lawmakers did n't have the money after rejecting his plan to cut heating aid for low-income families .
Despite work by Louisiana Sen. Johnston , Congress stops a program to use reprocessed plutonium for civilian energy .
HAITI ON HOLD : Any U.S. military move is likely to await a high-level U.N. mission giving Haiti 's generals a last warning to leave voluntarily .
But that is delayed as the U.N. decides to send a low-level mission first .
Almost unnoticed amid the Cuba furor , 30 new Haitian boat people are intercepted , the first in two weeks .
STRAIGHT SWAP : Empower America , the conservative advocacy group , lost one presidential candidate when director William Bennett decided not to run but picks up another .
Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander will become a director of the group .
Another is Jack Kemp .
PORK OR NOT ?
Democrats charge that Republicans were hypocritical in attacks on crime prevention spending .
They note that Danforth and Domenici backed money for community schools and Olympic development centers , and Dole introduced a gang initiative including a $ 100 million grant program for work with juveniles .
WHITE HOUSE aides enlist agribusiness leader Dwayne Andreas , whose company , Archer-Daniels-Midland , benefited from a recent EPA rule on ethanol , to seek Senate approval of a global biodiversity treaty .
Andreas wants the U.S. in on trade decisions by treaty signatories .
Dole , an Andreas ally , is a key opponent .
IMMIGRATION FEARS drive new efforts to block illegal aliens .
Even as the House and Senate wrangle over the crime bill , they quietly agree on much higher spending on immigration-law enforcement .
Congress appropriates $ 1.48 billion for the Immigration and Naturalization Service , substantially more than Clinton sought and 41 % more than this year 's budget .
Lawmakers agree to increase border patrol agents by 1,000 .
Congress orders that `` hot spot '' areas along the border get top priority in claiming the additional agents .
Lawmakers also appropriate $ 130 million for a new criminal alien-assistance program .
But California 's GOP Gov. Wilson , angered over the federal help Democratic governors Chiles in Florida and Richards in Texas get in stopping immigrants , opens a campaign to force Clinton to funnel more money to California .
Teachers unions and Catholics resist a California ballot initiative designed to deny health and education services to illegals .
MINOR MEMOS : Only in Washington : a T-shirt spotted in downtown D.C. reads , `` Real Men Marry Lawyers '' ... Heeding his own rhetoric about economic prospects in Asia , Bentsen sinks between $ 250,000 and $ 500,000 of his money in Morgan Stanley 's Asian Equity Fund ...

'' SALINEVILLE , Ohio -- Shareholders of Unity Bancorp , New Waterford , Ohio , approved a merger with Citizens Bancshares Inc. valued at about $ 5 million .
Terms call for each share of Unity common stock to be swapped for 1.21 shares of Citizens .
Pending regulatory clearance , the merger is expected to be completed by Dec. 31 .
LONDON -- In the battle for control of Britain 's telephone market , pub manager Irene Tait has sided with the Americans .
Earlier this summer , Ms. Tait unplugged her British Telecommunications PLC phone line and signed up for a new cable-phone service being offered by a unit of TeleCommunications Inc. of Denver .
Ms. Tait , who figures the switch to TCI has lowered her phone bill by about 20 % , says she relished the opportunity for revenge against BT , long the United Kingdom 's phone monopoly .
`` They 've had it one way , their way , for too long , '' said the Edinburgh , Scotland , resident .
TCI could n't agree more .
The cable giant , along with a half dozen other North American companies , has launched a Channel Tunnel-sized program aimed at wiring England for cable .
The companies , including U S West Inc. , Southwestern Bell Corp. and Nynex Corp. , have laid about 20,000 miles of wires and persuaded 500,000 Britons to sign up for TV and telephone service .
For the Yanks , Britain has the makings of a high-tech gold mine .
Not only is cable still a rarity -- only about 2 % of United Kingdom homes currently have it -- but a loose regulatory climate means cable operators can offer both telephone and TV service through their wires .
For the operators , England also serves as a critical testing ground for the deregulated U.S. market , where TV and telephone companies are merging their services in preparation for a multimedia market they hope will develop .
Yet despite the $ 15 billion price tag of the cable industry 's U.K. effort , it is far from a sure-fire success .
Consumers have been unexpectedly slow to embrace cable and the TV programming is sub-par .
In addition , investors are wary about the U.K. operators , who concede they do n't expect to make a profit for several years .
This summer a handful of the biggest cable companies in England , including Telewest , shelved planned stock offerings after investors lost interest .
Among the industry 's biggest headaches is the pit-bull response from British Telecom .
In June , BT sent 2,000 of its managers to Bristol in western England where a new cable franchisee was just getting started .
The managers went on a door-to-door campaign to persuade customers not to switch to cable .
The Bristol effort was a flop .
The local cable franchisee reports that business actually went up during the BT campaign because of the added awareness .
A similar grass-roots effort , this one employing 10,000 managers , is scheduled for the fall .
Meanwhile , BT is pressing a marketing and lobbying effort that portrays the bigbucks Americans as anything but the innocent upstarts they say they are .
Says David Orr , a phone company spokesman , `` These are far from fledgling operators ; there is big American money behind them .
'' BT 's response to cable may sound shrill , considering that the challengers have won over only 500,000 of Britain 's 24 million homes .
But it reflects a sense at BT that its franchise is under seige .
`` The threats ... to BT must not be underestimated , '' says the Cable Challenge , a memo sent to top BT managers .
The document says BT may be losing as many as 40,000 residential customers a month to cable .
`` Doing nothing is no longer an option , '' the memo intones .
Because cable operators can offer both phone and TV service , cable-telephone rates are about 15 % lower than BT 's .
And , they come with U.S.-style monthly itemized bills not normally available to BT customers .
`` It 's a no-lose situation , '' says Paul Harrison , director of a Newcastle architecture firm that recently dropped BT for cable .
`` If your bills do n't go down you can always go back .
In my opinion , this is going to be a massive threat to BT .
'' Maybe so , but for now neither TCI nor any of the other operators has made a dime and nobody expects the red ink to vanish for several years .
Of the areas where cable is available , only 20 % of the homeowners have taken up the offer , compared with 60 % in the U.S. .
The penetration rate has actually fallen since January and remains well below the 30 % to 40 % range operators need to make money .
Even more worrisome is the `` churn '' rate , which refers to people who sign up for the service and then cancel it after a short trial .
In some areas , the churn is nearly 40 % .
While some of that is due to discounting used to induce new customers to give cable a try , it also reflects a more bothersome problem that does n't involve BT at all : Cable-TV programming in Britain is lousy .
Because the British cable industry is so small , it ca n't afford to produce exclusive programming ; cable-only movies and payper-view specials have n't yet arrived .
That means cable operators are stuck with showing second-rate U.S. movies or the traditional CNN and MTV fare , which many already receive via satellite .
`` The cable companies have got to be feeling a little nervous at the moment , '' says Roger Luard , managing director of Flextech PLC , a cable programming provider .
`` They 've gone so far , they ca n't turn back .
'' WASHINGTON -- Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown dropped a stinger on China and Hong Kong even before starting his eight-day tour of those lands .
In news briefings here , he reiterated the Clinton administration 's support for a proposed change in U.S. country-of-origin rules that would effectively halt Hong Kong 's practice of assembling in China some of the garments it ships to the U.S. under its quotas .
By conferring origin to the country where the clothes are assembled , rather than where they are cut , the proposed rule would effectively deprive Hong Kong manufacturers of the laborcost savings gained by assembling goods across the border , and would take numerous jobs away from China .
Both Hong Kong and China object strongly to the change .
Mr. Brown said , however , that the change is needed to stem a flood of transshipped apparel that has hurt the U.S. textile industry .
`` Any objective analysis would demonstrate that transshipment is a problem , '' he told reporters .
He added that a measure pending in Congress to make this change part of the legislation to implement the Uruguay Round provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is a `` step in the right direction .
'' Mr. Brown 's statement removed all doubt as to where the administration stands on this measure .
A Senate-House conference is expected to vote on the issue early next month .
Mr. Brown stressed that otherwise he wishes no discomfort on his hosts .
He said that while he 'd certainly raise humanrights issues `` at appropriate times , '' his mission is primarily to `` promote America 's commercial interests .
'' Even a statement of principles that President Clinton is urging U.S. traders and investors to sign as a formal commitment to human rights may not be specifically directed at China .
Mr. Brown said he is considering the business community 's arguments that the statement should be applicable world-wide , rather than country-specific .
Mr. Brown 's China trip is also expected to produce a broad trade-framework accord and other agreements to make it easier for U.S. vendors to bid for business in transportation , power generation , telecommunications and financial services in China .
Mr. Brown called these sectors China 's growth industries .
Mr. Brown said the administration is n't planning to lift the remaining U.S. trade sanctions against China , which include the denial of political-risk insurance from the Overseas Private Insurance Corp. and of federal grants for investment preparations .
Denying news reports that suggested the contrary , he stressed that `` no action is anticipated , certainly no action during my mission , and no action that I know of in the near future .
'' With the chief executive officers of 24 U.S. companies in tow , Mr. Brown left yesterday for the trip .
He said he plans to meet Premier Li Peng and other senior Chinese officials .
NEW YORK -- Forget those tony addresses : The Wall Street brokerage business increasingly is moving away from Wall Street .
Since 1987 , New York state has lost 27,000 securities-industry jobs even as the rest of the nation gained 49,000 brokerage jobs , according to a newly issued report by the Securities Industry Association , a trade group .
The result : New York 's share of U.S. brokerage employment has plunged to less than 31 % from 43 % in 1973 .
More than 90 % of brokerage jobs in the state are in Manhattan .
Behind the exodus from New York are high rents , high taxes , quality-of-life issues and attractive business incentives offered by the Sunbelt and other regions , brokerage executives say .
`` New York took it for granted that we have to be here , '' says Jeffrey Schaefer , the trade group 's research chief and one of the report 's authors .
`` That no longer is true .
You no longer have to be near the stock exchange '' to do business on Wall Street , he notes .
The news has n't been all rotten for the Big Apple .
Some big brokers , including Morgan Stanley Group Inc. ; Prudential Securities Inc. , a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America ; and Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. , a unit of Equitable Cos. , have recently decided to stay put after considering a move out of state .
But any further job losses would severely cut into New York 's financial health .
In the 1992-93 fiscal year , the securities industry accounted for 11 % of New York state 's corporate net income taxes and 10 % of its personal income-tax payments , the report says .
A big loss for New York has been in `` back-office '' positions -- that is , securities-trade processing , bookkeeping , compliance and other support functions .
Since 1988 , New York has lost 20 % of its back-office jobs .
Some firms have relocated their back offices to New Jersey .
Among other alternative sites is Tampa , Fla. , where Salomon Inc. moved its back-office operations .
With the sky-high cost of New York turf -- among the priciest in the world -- some firms are asking : Why take Manhattan ?
Securities firms surveyed in the report paid an average annual cost of $ 42 a square foot for Manhattan rental space , almost double the $ 22-a-square-foot average in New Jersey .
And some firms in Manhattan paid $ 76 a square foot .
These rental costs add up , considering that brokerage firms lease about 43 million square feet in Manhattan -- enough to fill one of the World Trade Center towers 10 1\/2 times .
NEW YORK -- The Financial Accounting Standards Board said it plans to issue a rule Oct. 1 requiring companies to disclose more information about the derivatives they hold .
But some of the more rigorous disclosure requirements that FASB originally proposed probably will be watered down when the final rule is unveiled , because of complaints from banks and broker-dealers .
Derivatives are financial agreements whose returns are linked to , or derived from , the performance of some underlying asset , such as bonds , currencies or commodities .
FASB 's proposed rule would require more specific details about a company 's objectives for holding or selling derivatives , their risks , trading strategies and how and where these transactions are described in the annual report .
`` It 's clearly a step in the right direction , '' says John Verdonck , a partner in the financial-services practice at KPMG Peat Marwick .
`` But it 's not going to be giving people enough information to do an indepth analysis of a company 's risk-management strategies .
'' Under the original proposal , made in April , companies that hold derivatives for trading purposes , such as banks and broker-dealers , would be required to disclose the maximum and minimum amount of each class of derivative security held or issued during the year .
But when the final draft of the rule is unveiled in October , it will only require banks and broker-dealers to report the average amount of derivatives held or issued during the year .
In addition , under the original proposal , companies would have had to break out the net gains and losses arising solely from derivatives instruments .
But the final draft will require companies to disclose the net gains or losses in each business or risk category and indicate what types of instruments accounted for the losses or gains .
`` People said they could n't easily pull out the net gains and losses from derivatives alone , '' said Jeffrey Mahoney , the FASB 's assistant project manager .
Thus , if a company has a $ 100 million loss in commodities , it will be required to disclose that loss and identify the various financial instruments that contributed to the loss .
The net gains or losses , which will be footnoted , will have to relate back to the company 's income statement .
Accountants say the new rule will still keep investors in the dark about some soured derivatives trades .
That 's because the FASB only requires companies to report losses that are `` material .
'' According to accountants , material losses generally refer to losses that will reduce profits or assets by 5 % or more .
The FASB 's move caps a three-month comment period during which the accounting board received about 140 letters about the rule it proposed in April .
Mr. Mahoney said the proposed rule would be reflected in full-year 1994 financial statements .
KINGSTON , N.Y. -- Madison Sports & Entertainment Inc. signed a letter of intent to acquire all of the stock of National Media Inc. , a Florida-based developer and distributor of videos and TV properties .
Terms were n't disclosed .
DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union settled a disruptive three-day strike at a taillight plant after GM agreed to maintain current employment levels at the facility through 1997 , union officials said .
The taillight plant , in Anderson , Ind. , was to resume production following the ratification vote last night .
The walkout at the plant had idled 13 GM assembly plants , and most of those plants are n't expected to reopen until next week .
`` It 's an excellent agreement , '' said UAW regional director Ron Gettelfinger .
Mr. Gettelfinger said the union got `` satisfaction on all issues , '' including its complaint that the company was moving work from Anderson to non-UAW shops .
Union officials said the agreement was approved by 96 % of the plant 's workers .
Before the strike , GM had planned to eliminate as many as 1,000 of the 3,300 UAW-represented jobs at the plant by the end of the 1997 model year .
Now , GM has pledged to maintain the employment level while pursuing increased productivity jointly with the union , said Jim King , president of UAW Local 663 , which represents the Anderson plant .
GM declined to discuss details of the settlement , saying only , `` With the settlement , we can resume our efforts to make Anderson a strong , competitive operation .
'' Even though Anderson was to resume production immediately following the vote , even more assembly plants probably will be idled temporarily before parts reach them , GM officials said .
The company said a 14th plant would be idled today .
Despite the quick settlement , the Anderson walkout is expected to be GM 's most expensive work stoppage since 1992 , when a nine-day strike at a Lordstown , Ohio , metal-stamping plant idled nine GM assembly plants .
As of yesterday evening , the Anderson strike had forced GM to shut down 13 assembly plants that employ more than 40,000 workers .
David Healy of S.G. Warburg & Co. estimated the strike will reduce GM 's third-quarter profit by $ 30 million to $ 40 million .
He said the financial damage would have mounted rapidly if the strike had continued into next week , particularly since GM relies on a single plant for virtually all its taillights .
`` Somewhere back in prehistory , someone made a mistake by sourcing every single taillight out of one plant , '' said Mr. Healy .
`` The union really had them .
'' Like Lordstown , the Anderson strike underscored the conflicting agendas the company and UAW have for GM as the company restructures its bloated North American operations .
Many in the company want GM to sell off additional parts-making operations and emerge as a lean company with much less vertical integration , like Chrysler Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. .
The UAW , while cooperating with GM 's productivity drive in some areas , wants GM to emerge as a lean but highly integrated company .
`` This strike is n't about whether GM will restructure , it 's about how it will restructure , '' said Harley Shaiken , a labor expert at the University of California at Berkeley , before the settlement .
The Anderson walkout was the fourth time the UAW had struck GM plants to protest the company 's efficiency drive .
In each case , GM agreed to hire additional workers or eased plans to cut jobs .
Nevertheless , analyst Philip Fricke of Prudential Securities said GM continues to make major productivity improvements .
`` Flare-ups are to be expected all along the way , '' he said .
`` In no sense does this derail GM 's productivity drive .
'' GM 's North American operations have swung to an estimated $ 1.7 billion after-tax profit this year from a $ 4.8 billion operating loss in 1990 , Mr. Fricke said .
While a big part of that turnaround comes from the improved car market , reducing labor costs through a combination of attrition and special early retirements has been nearly as important a factor , he said .
Mr. Fricke noted that GM , which currently has about 252,000 U.S. hourly workers , has eliminated 77,000 workers since 1990 .

RICHMOND , Va. -- The Virginia State Corporation Commission has launched a broad investigation into the relationship between Dominion Resources Inc. and its Virginia Power subsidiary .
The inquiry , which follows a management dispute between the two companies , will focus on how the relationship `` may affect , beneficially or adversely , the public interest , '' according to a commission statement .
The commission said it may consider new rules and regulations governing dealings between the utility and its unregulated parent in light of their recent feud .
The commission also said it has n't ruled on a joint motion by the two companies to dismiss key features of its continuing investigation , launched in June , and that case will proceed .
A spokesman for Dominion said the company will fully comply with the investigation and that its corporate structure adequately serves customers and shareholders .
WASHINGTON -- A Pocatello , Idaho , used-car dealer who last year purchased the major components of a nuclear reprocessor at an Energy Department salvage auction said the federal government is refusing to meet his price to buy it back .
After The Wall Street Journal reported Aug. 3 that Tom Johansen had purchased the machinery -- which when combined with some additional components can extract bomb-grade uranium from nuclear waste -- Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary pledged to buy or seize the material back .
She also dispatched guards to the previously unguarded warehouse where Mr. Johansen keeps the equipment .
Late Wednesday , Richard Hopf , deputy assistant energy secretary for procurement , wrote to Mr. Johansen that the department was willing to continue discussing a federal repurchase of the material , but that `` we can not justify '' paying much more than Mr. Johansen did -- $ 153,999.99 -- plus any `` documented incidental costs '' he incurred .
The letter also reminded Mr. Johansen that the items are subject to export-control restrictions , and that `` we will continue to monitor the property to ensure that the interests of the United States are protected .
'' But Mr. Johansen said that Energy Department officials had previously discussed paying him closer to $ 500,000 , a figure confirmed by a department official .
`` I would n't accept that , '' Mr. Johansen said of the latest offer .
`` I 'm just going to hang that up in the bathroom in case I run out of toilet paper .
'' When the World Trade Center was rocked by a terrorist explosion Feb. 26 , 1993 , its owners knew the public 's confidence in the building also would be shaken .
Now , having repaired most of the physical damage , the owner of the World Trade Center , the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , is putting the finishing touches on an ambitious international marketing campaign to try to attract office and retail tenants , tourists and shoppers .
The campaign will be created by Grey Advertising , which won the account in May following a review that began with more than 100 ad agencies participating .
Grey and Port Authority executives are mum on the exact theme of the campaign , but it would be fair to say it 's close to the concept , `` It 's my world and welcome to it .
'' The campaign is expected to begin in October and continue through 1995 .
Even though the bombing wo n't be mentioned in the ads , World Trade Center executives realize the disaster is still very much on the public 's mind .
`` The bombing received front page news , but the rapid recovery did n't receive the same exposure in the domestic and international press , '' says Charles Maikish , director of the World Trade Center .
`` The bombing had no long-term effect , and that is n't known in the world .
We 'd like people to know we are back in business .
'' The World Trade Center account may be small in billings -- approximately $ 10 million -- but it is of great importance to Grey .
Such an assignment showcases an ad agency 's ability to perform integrated marketing .
Grey Advertising will produce the print ad campaign .
-LRB- No television advertising is planned at the moment -RRB- .
Its Beaumont-Bennett unit will produce sales promotions and booklets , explaining the advantages of the complex .
Grey Business Worldwide will identify businesses that might be candidates to lease office space in the World Trade Center .
Grey Direct will send mailings to targeted companies with leases that are expiring .
Grey Entertainment and Grey 's public relations arm will be used to promote the center as a visitor destination .
Integrated marketing is increasingly important as companies look to their ad agencies for expertise beyond advertising .
This week , for example , Digital Equipment selected Omnicom Group 's DDB Needham to handle its world-wide account .
One of the reasons is Needham 's capability in integrated marketing , including direct mailings .
Even without the bombing , Grey would face a significant challenge in changing people 's perception of the World Trade Center , which is also known as the Twin Towers .
The Twin Towers nickname actually illustrates part of the problem because the World Trade Center is actually six office buildings , a shopping mall , a hotel , restaurants and an outdoor plaza for lounging and listening to concerts .
`` Everything is dwarfed by the twin towers , '' says Mr. Maikish .
`` Therefore , there is a great deal of confusion over what the center is .
'' Although the office occupancy rate of 90 % is up slightly from the time of the bombing , the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey believe the World Trade Center could do even better and want it to be on the wish list of every business looking for office space , no matter the size .
The belief in the international marketplace is that the center accommodates only the largest commercial enterprises , says Mr. Maikish .
`` We need to get the message across that we also have small and midsize businesses .
'' World Trade Center executives say the number of visitors to the complex 's major tourist attraction , the Observation Deck , has `` recovered nicely '' after a drop off when it first reopened after the bombing .
But the center wants to attract visitors to more of its attractions .
The intent of the campaign , says Edward H. Meyer , Grey 's chairman and chief executive officer , `` is to convey the full size and importance of the structure .
Our challenge is to build traffic and to have the complex perceived as a city within a city .
'' The ads will not only encompass the actual World Trade Center complex , but will also promote lower Manhattan itself , including Battery Park City , the World Financial Center and trendy restaurants such as Tribeca Grill .
`` We have to send a message about where the World Trade Center is , '' says Mr. Maikish .
`` It is in the financial district , but that area is no longer desolate after dark as it once was .
'' The shopping mall itself is undergoing a redesign , and after losing some retail tenants , the center has been successful in attracting such stores as Nine West , the Limited , the Gap and Speedo Authentic Fitness , as well as some restaurants including a Fine & Shapiro deli and a new mini-McDonald 's .
New passageways are under construction to try to increase pedestrian traffic near the stores .
In addition to Grey 's campaign , Hilton International , owner of the Vista hotel , which was heavily damaged in the bombing and is undergoing a facelift , plans a major advertising push when the hotel reopens in November .
Steven E. Permut , president of Marketing Sciences , a marketing and advertising consulting firm in Guilford , Conn. , says such a broad campaign `` makes sense as long as they have specific messages to each audience .
But I question how much influence an ad or mailing will have to a sophisticated businessman whose job it is to study leases and make such decisions as to where office space would be .
'' Curiously , the bombing does n't seem to pose a perception problem abroad .
`` It has n't come up in our research among businessmen and consumers at all , '' says Jeff Klein , chief executive of Grey Business Worldwide .
`` Therefore , we wo n't address the bombing .
Unfortunately , it is far too common in other parts of the world .

GENERAL MOTORS : GM has bought exclusive domestic car and truck sponsorship rights on General Electric-unit NBC 's coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta .
The value of the deal is estimated to be more than $ 50 million .

SYDNEY , Australia -- News Corp. 's profit , excluding special items , jumped 24 % in fiscal 1994 , ended June 30 .
But the report was n't as good as many analysts expected .
Pretax profit totaled 1.21 billion Australian dollars -LRB- US$ 896.6 million -RRB- , up from A$ 979 million a year earlier .
Counting a one-time gain of A$ 123 million , earnings soared 55 % to A$ 1.34 billion from A$ 864.3 million .
The gain was mostly related to News Corp. 's stake in the South China Morning Post , a Hong Kong daily .
Fiscal 1994 revenue rose 8.6 % to A$ 11.6 billion from A$ 10.7 billion .
On the Australian Stock Exchange , News Corp. shares slid 15 Australian cents to close at A$ 9 each yesterday .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , News Corp. .
American depositary receipts closed at $ 53.625 , off 75 cents .
`` People were expecting a surprise on the upside and the surprise , if anything , was on the downside , '' said Terry Povey , an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London .
With earnings of A$ 1.21 billion before one-time items , News Corp. fell short of Mr. Povey 's estimate of A$ 1.3 billion mainly because of a fourth-quarter loss at News Corp. 's Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. unit .
It had two disappointing films in the quarter -- `` Baby 's Day Out '' and `` PCU .
'' With the film unit 's earnings looking erratic , Mr. Povey is lowering his profit estimates for the current year to A$ 1.35 billion from a previous forecast of A$ 1.45 billion .
And he 's downgrading his recommendation on the stock to a `` hold '' from a `` buy .
'' U.S. operations rose 12 % from a year earlier .
The company 's Fox Broadcasting Co. television operations were a top performer , with earnings jumping more than 20 % to a new high .
News Corp. said its recent investment in New World Communications Group Inc. has increased its television-affiliate base to 184 stations from 138 .
Operating profit at its 50 % - owned British Sky Broadcasting Ltd. , known as BSkyB , more than doubled to # 170 million -LRB- $ 263.5 million -RRB- from # 61.4 million a year earlier .
Revenue jumped to # 551 million from # 380 million and the total number of paying subscribers grew to 3.5 million from 2.4 million .
Also in Britain , where News Corp. 's stable of newspapers is embroiled in a price war , analysts estimated operating profit tumbled about 35 % to # 54 million .
In Hong Kong , where the company owns 64 % of Star TV , a pan-Asian satellite TV broadcaster , the company had losses .
While News Corp. did n't break out results for Star TV , analysts estimated the annual loss at less than US$ 20 million , in line with expectations .
Most of the bank debt that put News Corp. into a financial bind in 1990 has been refinanced as long-term debt securities in the hands of investors .
Media analysts estimate that the company 's debt burden , adjusted for currency-rate fluctuations and cash on hand , has declined to A$ 7.7 billion from A$ 10 billion a year ago .
That compares with a peak in December 1990 of more than A$ 12 billion .
NEW YORK -- SF Broadcasting L.L.C. , a joint venture between Savoy Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Fox Television Stations , agreed to buy three television stations and a production studio from Burnham Broadcasting Co. for $ 229 million .
The stations are expected to switch their affiliations to the Fox network , which , like Fox Television Stations , is a unit of News Corp. .
The three stations are New Orleans ' WVUE , currently affiliated with Capital Cities\/ABC Inc. 's ABC network , and two affiliates of General Electric Co. 's NBC : WALA in Mobile , Ala. , and KHON in Honolulu .
The transaction also includes a Hawaii production facility , McHale Video Film .
The Mobile station may be sold , however , the companies said , declining to elaborate .
SF was formed earlier this year to buy stations that would become Fox affiliates .
SF is also considering starting a television production operation , using the stations as a laboratory to test shows .
The stations will be 74 % owned by movie distributor Savoy , 25 % by Fox Television Stations and 1 % by a corporation owned by Savoy principals Victor A. Kaufman and Lewis J. Korman , which will own all the voting stock .
Savoy said Fox will also provide additional funds for the acquisition and will have the right to acquire additional interest in the stations in the future .
Closely held Burnham also recently agreed to sell its Green Bay , Wis. , station , WLUK , to SF for $ 38 million .
That station , an NBC affiliate , is also expected to switch to Fox .
Mr. Kaufman , Savoy 's chairman and chief executive , said the company plans to continue acquiring stations .
`` We 're going to be active , '' he said .
`` We believe in the business and in Fox and what they 're doing .
'' He declined to comment on reports that SF may buy two stations that New World Communications Group , a majority-controlled unit of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. , has agreed to buy and switch to Fox .
ENFIELD , Conn. -- Dairy Mart Convenience Stores Inc. said that it expects to report `` very disappointing '' break-even results for its fiscal second quarter and that its board fired Frank Colaccino as president and chief executive officer .
Dairy Mart said its board formed a special committee to seek a successor to Mr. Colaccino , 44 years old , as chief executive .
Mr. Colaccino , who could n't be reached for comment , will remain as a director .
The convenience-store operator said Robert B. Stein , 36 years old , was named chief operating officer .
Mr. Stein retains his post as executive vice president , store operations .
Dairy Mart chief financial officer Gregory G. Landry said the company expects to report break-even results for its fiscal second quarter ended July 30 , traditionally the concern 's best period .
For the second quarter ended July 31 , 1993 , Dairy Mart reported net income of $ 2.4 million , or 44 cents a share , on revenue of $ 158.8 million .
For the first quarter ended April 30 , 1994 , the company posted a widened net loss of $ 2 million , or 36 cents a share , citing snow removal costs and other factors .
Mr. Landry said the company , which had hoped to `` at least match '' year-ago results for the second quarter , `` is not performing up to internal expectations .
'' Dairy Mart operates about 1,000 stores in 11 states , mostly in the Northeast and Midwest .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading , Dairy Mart closed yesterday at $ 3 , down 25 cents , or 7.7 % .
NEW YORK -- Blackstone Group L.P. said Mikael Salovaara , a former Goldman Sachs & Co. partner , will join the private investment bank , effective Sept. 1 .
The 40-year-old Mr. Salovaara left Goldman Sachs in 1991 after the firm scrapped a controversial junk-bond `` vulture fund '' that was run by Mr. Salovaara and two colleagues , Alfred C. Eckert III and Kenneth D. Brody .
The $ 783 million Water Street Corporate Recovery Fund was shut down after a backlash against the fund by Goldman clients .
Blackstone said Mr. Salovaara will be primarily responsible for principal investing activities and will be a member of the firm 's investment committee .
After leaving Goldman Sachs in 1991 , Mr. Salovaara went to start Greycliff Partners , a $ 300 million investment fund .
Though Greycliff will not be making any new investments , Blackstone said Mr. Salovaara will spend part of his time on Greycliff 's existing operations .
At age four Blue Tyler was a top star at Cosmopolitan Pictures .
At age 23 she was out of the business .
At age 33 she was ... well , this is how she puts it : `` Baby , I just fell off the planet earth .
'' She 's rediscovered , in her 60s and now known as Mabel Mae Toolate , sometime bag lady and reclusive resident of a trailer park in Detroit .
The man who finds her , someone with his own troubles , is Jack Broderick , a screenwriter who develops a special need to find out what really happened to Blue Tyler .
Broderick 's quest spawns the sprawling story of `` Playland '' -LRB- Random House , 494 pages , $ 25 -RRB- , author and screenwriter John Gregory Dunne 's brilliantly lurid Hollywood novel .
But this is no ordinary Hollywood novel , though it contains the requisite sex , violence and duplicity .
`` Playland '' is something else , a shrewd insider 's vision of the vulgarity and brutality that operated in the old Hollywood and still does in the new .
It 's also an investigation into the nature of truth , which Mr. Dunne ponders cleverly , not ponderously , as he sends Broderick into the field to get the story on Blue Tyler .
What Broderick discovers is the Hollywood of the '30s and '40s , a place where garment manufacturers , gangsters and poor girls with pretty faces converge , all of them trying to re-create themselves .
Jews out of the Lower East Side become movie moguls and start affecting WASP pretensions .
Hoods become casino operators and movie producers and hire decorators to worry about whether their carpets should be peach-colored .
Young girls become movie stars and indulge the perverse sexual appetites of their employers so they can enjoy the riches of celebrity .
This transformation is succinctly put by Benny Draper , a union honcho , as he watches studio chief J.F. French -LRB- formerly Moe Frankel -RRB- cheer his son at a polo match : `` Hey , Moe , you know what they say ?
Poland to polo in one generation .
'' Broderick does n't accept either the myths manufactured by the studios or by the old-timers who still remember Blue Tyler .
He examines newspaper clippings , police reports , court transcripts -- all of which become part of the book 's dense entertainment .
As his search for the truth about Blue becomes a balancing act , here 's what he puts on the scale : `` Genius .
Whore .
Individualist .
Iconoclast .
Liar .
Free spirit .
Bag lady ... A case of severely arrested development whose first priority was always the maintenance of her own interests .
A moral force more honest and uncompromising than her contemporaries .
'' Finally , Broderick concludes , `` All the above would be my choice .
'' `` Playland '' is packed with stories and characters , some appearing as themselves -LRB- Walter Winchell or Carole Lombard -RRB- , others appearing as fictionalized versions of people who existed or might have .
There 's Chuckie O'Hara , the shrewd gay director who made many of Blue 's early pictures .
He 's a great source for Broderick , even though he has the director 's tendency to build a better scene by making `` improvements '' on every memory .
There 's Rabbi Tyger , `` who took voice lessons and sold religion the way his flock sold their motion pictures , avoiding piety as if it were a sin , even offering absolution to the moguls for their sexual transgressions .
'' And there are the gangsters , on both coasts .
The New Yorkers come to Hollywood for the money , of course .
But there are other reasons .
The moguls and the mobsters may pretend to disdain one another , but they are the same -- street people who muscled their way up the ladder .
These crude princes become the elite to whom the regular rules do n't apply .
Which brings the story to Jacob King -LRB- formerly Yakov Kinovsky -RRB- , the mobster who comes West to strike it big .
King gives the book its central romance and its central metaphor .
He and Blue spot in one another a capacity for extreme coarseness and passion that leads , inevitably , to destruction .
That 's the romance .
The metaphor is `` Playland '' itself .
Literally it 's the Las Vegas nightclub King begins building to establish himself as a powerful force , independent of everyone , including his New York backers .
The danger and promise in this enterprise consumes King as surely as his attraction for Blue .
Less literally , `` Playland '' is Hollywood and New York and Las Vegas -- and all the places where people like Blue and Jacob -LRB- and their bosses and courtiers -RRB- live their insular and corrupt lives .
`` Playland '' has the tough , sparkling dialogue of movie melodrama and the rich detail of social history .
Simultaneously cynical and awestruck , Mr. Dunne is both intellectual and vulgarian in his approach to this mobster-movie star cliche .
His fascination with Hollywood minutiae is backed by meticulous research and experience -LRB- he worked in the movie business for 25 years -RRB- .
Mr. Dunne 's agile narrative provides perspective -- much of it savagely funny -- on the glamour , the pathos and the extreme raunchiness of the business , then and now .
His appreciation of what is attractive about these larger-than-life characters -- and what is repulsive -- produces an enthralling story .
MEXICO CITY -- President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said in an interview that political reform in Mexico `` has to go much further .
'' President Salinas , now just three months away from leaving office , has accomplished enormous economic reform by making full use of his office 's nearly omnipotent powers , known here as presidencialismo .
But he now appears to be the last of the breed of presidential titans who could single-handedly designate their successors as the presidential candidate of their party , known as the PRI .
That 's a privilege tantamount to picking the next president , given the PRI 's 65 uninterrupted years in office .
Ernesto Zedillo , who on Sunday unofficially won another six years of the presidency for the ruling party , has said he will abandon many of the trappings of presidencialismo .
And President Salinas , who has n't always been enthusiastic about political reform , lent his support in the interview .
The president said he felt he had accomplished significant reform at the national level by finally separating the PRI from the government .
They have historically been so intertwined that the party could use all the government 's resources to keep itself in power .
But he encouraged the PRI and the new government to extend the changes to the state and local levels .
`` I 'm going to show you something , '' the president said , jumping up from a chair where he had been sitting beneath a Diego Rivera painting of a peasant woman hunched over , making tortillas .
He went to his desk in his office at the official residence , Los Pinos , and came back with a letter written by a mayor in the state of Oaxaca requesting various government services .
The letter , though written by one government official to another , was on PRI stationery .
`` We have a cultural symbiosis here that we have to work very hard to end , '' President Salinas said , shaking his head .
The president himself has been criticized for deciding that economic reform needed to be in place before political reform would be possible , but he has generally been credited with supervising the cleanest elections in Mexican history .
And he said in the interview that he expected a new type of prosecutor to pursue reports of electoral fraud , to send the message for the next elections that fraud wo n't be tolerated .
President Salinas was n't specific about how much fraud he expected would be prosecuted .
But when told about a clear instance of coercion of votes -- a civic leader who was told that a road would be built for her small town only if it voted for the PRI -- he became animated .
`` We want to know the name '' of the official who made the threat , `` because he will go to jail , '' Mr. Salinas said sternly .
Asked about the future of politics in Mexico , given reports that the left 's poor showing on Sunday leaves it moribund , President Salinas speculated that the left would continue to play an important role .
He agreed that the left would need to restructure itself , especially because its leader , Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , has said he wo n't run again for president after losing both in 1988 and this year and because there is no obvious successor to him .
But President Salinas said the main question is whether the left will remain within the mainstream of politics or whether parts will give up on the party system and become more radical .
`` There is a long tradition of a leftist organization participating in politics in Mexico , and that is going to continue , '' he said .
`` I think it 's very important that that continue to happen within a party structure .
'' Mr. Salinas did seem concerned about what might happen tomorrow , when Mr. Cardenas is scheduled to speak about electoral fraud before tens of thousands of supporters .
The president seemed to hold out an olive branch to Mr. Cardenas -- an unusual gesture , given the bitterness of their 1988 contest that has left the two with little use for each other .
`` Mr. Cardenas has played an important role in promoting democracy in Mexico , '' he said , `` and I 'm sure he would be welcome to continue in that role .
'' But the president did n't seem concerned about the prospect that Subcommander Marcos , the masked leader of the Indian rebellion in Chiapas , would emerge as the new standardbearer of the left .
`` We would like , as part of the solution of the Chiapas problem , to bring the people there into the political process , '' he said .
While Subcommander Marcos is far more radical and charismatic than Mr. Cardenas , the president added , if the rebel leader gets involved in the political process , `` he might lose some of his magic .
'' WASHINGTON -- AT&T Corp. , clearing one of the last major hurdles in its effort to acquire McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. , received federal court approval to proceed with its purchase .
U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene , who oversees the 1982 consent decree that broke up the Bell System , rejected arguments from regional Bell companies that the $ 12.6 billion acquisition of McCaw was an attempt by AT&T to recreate the old Bell System .
McCaw 's extensive wireless network could bypass local telephone exchanges .
`` It is clear that the decree was never intended to prevent AT&T from competing in the cellular marketplace , '' Judge Greene wrote in a 26-page opinion granting AT&T a waiver of the decree .
AT&T , the country 's largest long-distance carrier , said it was pleased with the decision , and added , `` We remain confident that the merger will be completed on schedule , '' by the end of September .
The company still needs approval from the Federal Communications Commission to take over McCaw 's cellular-phone licenses , and faces a legal challenge by Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. .
On Wednesday , Judge Greene sent the Bell companies ' lawsuit back to Judge Edward Korman in Brooklyn , N.Y. , where it was filed .
AT&T won the most important battle last month , when the Justice Department gave antitrust approval to the McCaw deal .
AT&T had to promise , among other things , that it would n't unfairly favor McCaw in the sale of equipment and would give long-distance rivals equal access to McCaw customers .
The Justice Department 's support made Judge Greene 's approval more likely .
Still , the case was complicated enough that Judge Greene last April denied a request for a quick ruling .
He noted that McCaw holds minority interests in some cellular systems , including those in Los Angeles and Houston , that are controlled by regional Bell companies , and therefore are considered `` Bell operating companies '' under the consent decree .
The decree prohibits AT&T from buying assets of such companies .
To gain a waiver , AT&T had to prove that conditions had changed in unanticipated ways since 1982 .
Judge Greene said the situation had changed , because the drafters of the consent decree did n't expect Bell companies to expand into telephone service outside their regions .
`` It 's a safe bet we 'll appeal it , '' Walter Alford , BellSouth Corp. 's general counsel , said of the AT&T decision .
`` Their waiver has been granted .
We 're still waiting .
'' Bell companies , which have invested heavily in cellular-phone service , have been trying to gain freedom to offer long-distance calls through their cellular systems , arguing that they 'll otherwise be at a disadvantage competing with AT&T .
Indeed , even though it 's trying to block the McCaw acquisition , Bell Atlantic actually came out in favor of AT&T 's consent-decree waiver , figuring it would help set a precedent for Bell Atlantic to get waivers to provide services such as long-distance video .
However , Judge Greene refused to link the AT&T waiver with the Bell companies ' requests .
He noted that Congress is considering reforms that would let Bell companies into the long-distance business , and chided the Bell companies for seeking quick action from him to break down the barriers .
`` The court is confounded by the sudden show of confidence , '' he wrote .
NEW DELHI -- Many Indian companies have been lavishing discounted shares on their controlling shareholders -- a sign for other investors to beware .
Since New Delhi abolished controls on new equity issues in 1992 , several companies have obtained shareholder approval to issue blocks of shares at steep discounts to market prices in favor of so-called `` promoters , '' or the principal shareholders who control the companies ' management .
That dilutes earnings per share , fund managers said .
`` We 're very cautious about deep discounts , '' said Vinod Sethi , chief executive of Morgan Stanley Asset Management India Pvt. Ltd. `` They can be subject to a lot of misuse , run against shareholder democracy and , if they become endemic , will eventually reduce price\/earnings ratios .
'' Even more insidious , some investors said , are discounted warrant issues to promoters , which the controlling shareholders may use to effectively consolidate their hold over a company , often without paying in advance .
-LRB- Discounted warrants are often awarded at no cost ; the holder then pays a predetermined price for the shares when he exercises the warrants .
-RRB- These act as a `` hidden equity issue , '' said P.N. Vijay , managing director of Delhi-based P.N. Vijay Financial Services Pvt. Ltd. : When exercised , they can cause shares outstanding to mushroom .
Roddy Sale , a Bombay-based manager at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. , is especially wary of preferential issues at small companies with insufficient liquidity on the stock exchanges .
For these firms , even small-share transactions can cause prices to fluctuate markedly , he said .
In response , some fund managers are starting to look more closely at companies that have issued preferential issues , or those reserved for a select block of investors .
`` We 're frankly asking companies for an assurance that they wo n't do preferential issues over the next two or three years , '' said Alexander Wilberforce , Delhi-based director of Genesis Pacific Management Ltd. , a London fund-management firm , which recently opened an office in India .
Some institutional investors dislike preferential issues even when they are sold at market prices , because the issues dilute other shareholders ' stakes without giving them the chance to increase their holdings .
One fund manager recounts how potential investors interrogated managers at Jindal Photo Films Ltd. about a recent preferential issue .
The Bombay-listed photographic-film maker , which hoped to court international investors for a $ 35 million private placement , subsequently dropped its plans after a poor response from investors unhappy with the preferential issue , the fund manager said .
A similar fate almost befell Dr. Reddy 's Laboratories ' issue of global depositary receipts , which are traded on foreign exchanges in lieu of the underlying shares .
The Bombay-listed pharmaceutical company had recently made a preferential issue .
The offering eventually went through , but Dr. Reddy 's GDRs now trade at the equivalent of a 10 % discount to the share price .
Fund managers said they 're prepared to tolerate preferential issues at companies they feel have strong fundamentals , such as steel producer Tata Iron & Steel Co. , whose shareholders last month approved issuing warrants to promoters in a move that helped other companies in the Tata group , a Bombay-based conglomerate , increase their combined stake in Tata Iron & Steel from 7.5 % to 15 % .
An official of pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. said that on a roadshow to place $ 100 million of GDRs in June , management of the company was closely questioned about a recent discounted , preferential share issue .
Because the company 's fundamentals were strong , the GDR issue went through , albeit at a discount to the company 's share price in Bombay at the time .
Ranbaxy 's GDRs are quoted at about a 10 % premium to the company 's Indian share price .
Other listed companies that have made preferential issues to promoters include Calcutta electric utility CESC Ltd. ; electronics manufacturer Videocon International Ltd. ; Bombay Dyeing Ltd. , a textile maker ; and Essar Shipping Ltd. .
Subsidiaries of foreign companies have been among the leaders in issuing preferential shares .
Foreign companies were obliged in the 1970s to reduce their holdings in Indian subsidiaries to below 40 % ; since 1992 they 've taken advantage of the liberalized economy to raise their stakes to 51 % or more by having the subsidiaries issue them new shares , often at more than 80 % below the market price .
Among the subsidiaries that have awarded such discounts to their parent companies are Colgate Palmolive India Ltd. ; Castrol India Ltd. , a lubricants company ; Sesa Goa Ltd. , a mining company ; Hoechst India Ltd. ; and Procter & Gamble Co. 's Indian subsidiary .
India 's Securities and Exchange Board sought to tackle the problem earlier this month when it decreed that preferential shares and warrants must be issued in accordance with a pricing formula that brings the issue price close to current market levels .
But the law does n't prohibit shareholder-approved new public issues or rights issues at a discount to the market price .
An issue can qualify as `` public '' even if just 25 % of the new equity on offer goes to the general public .
`` Devious minds can always find ways around '' the rules , said Morgan Stanley 's Mr. Sethi .
Shares of companies shadowed by past discounted issues may continue to suffer .
`` People will look at the past and wonder about the managements of these companies , '' said Mr. Wilberforce of Genesis .
TAIPEI , Taiwan -- Four months after it set out to punish Beijing for a coverup of the robbery -- killing of 24 Taiwan tourists on the China mainland , Taipei is moving full speed in the other direction .
By early August , the government had lifted the restrictions on business and cultural exchanges it imposed after the March 31 killings .
More important , it announced in the past two weeks several measures to lower longstanding barriers to trade and investment in China .
For example , Taiwan banks will be allowed to conduct some direct business with China , businesses will be able to sponsor visitors from the mainland , and the government is working to set up direct transportation links across the Taiwan Strait .
Each measure represents only a small step toward freeing economic exchanges with China , which remain tightly regulated in the unending test of wills between Taipei and Beijing .
But viewed together , they demonstrate to Beijing , as well as to Taiwan businesspeople , that the government is seeking a new equilibrium in its relations with China .
Several of the initiatives were placed on the back burner after the tourist killings on Qiandao Lake in eastern China , which sparked deep outrage in Taiwan .
Officials and analysts say policy changes are likely to be too slow to please Taiwan businesspeople , but liberalization of economic relations with China is once again moving ahead .
`` From looking at these measures , we can see that crossstrait relations are moving toward stability , '' says Wu An-chia of the Institute for International Relations , Taiwan 's leading center for the study of China .
Business executives and officials responsible for economic policy have argued that tight restrictions on trade and investment in China have put Taiwan enterprises at a disadvantage in the race to penetrate the mainland market .
WASHINGTON -- Money-market mutual-fund assets slumped $ 6.54 billion in the week ended Wednesday , to $ 592.52 billion from a revised $ 599.06 billion in the previous week , the Investment Company Institute said .
Assets of 672 retail money-market mutual funds decreased $ 2.40 billion to $ 424.11 billion , the trade group said .
Among retail funds , the assets of 418 taxable money-market funds fell $ 1.68 billion to $ 332.42 billion , while assets of 254 retail tax-exempt funds slid $ 717.2 million to $ 91.69 billion .
Assets of 284 institutional money-market funds tumbled $ 4.14 billion to $ 168.42 billion .
Among institutional funds , the assets of 229 taxable money-market funds fell by $ 3.29 billion to $ 147.38 billion , while assets of 55 tax-exempt funds decreased by $ 852 million to $ 21.03 billion .
PORT WASHINGTON , N.Y. -- Publisher 's Clearing House agreed to change the way it promotes its well-known sweepstakes , including how it uses the word `` finalist .
'' Under an agreement with attorneys general in 14 states , the company also said it would pay the states $ 490,000 toward litigation costs .
Closely held Publisher 's Clearing House offers magazine subscriptions , and the sweepstakes as an inducement to sign up .
`` In many ways , the agreement confirms practices and procedures that we have observed all along , '' the company said in a statement .
`` Where other issues were raised by the group , we moved quickly to clarify our promotions .
'' The attorneys general said Publisher 's Clearing House `` routinely '' used the word finalist even when the solicitation was the first the consumer received .
The agreement also calls for Publisher 's Clearing House to refrain from making consumers believe that purchase of a magazine is necessary to win a prize , and to select a winner even if no one returns the original `` winning number .
'' `` These reforms should not only ensure an end to practices of Publisher 's Clearing House which we considered misleading and deceptive , but also set a higher standard for the rest of the sweepstakes industry to follow in their own promotions , '' said New York Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell .
TOKYO -- Trillions of yen in cheap loans were supposed to win Japan friends among Asia 's poorest countries .
Instead , the soaring yen is making mincemeat of their budgets -- and of Japan 's attempts to expand its leadership in the region .
As Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama continues an official tour of Southeast Asia , flying Friday from Vietnam to Malaysia , economists say many of Asia 's emerging countries are having trouble scraping together enough yen to pay back loans to Japan .
The problem strikes at the heart of Japan 's search for a post-Cold War role in Asia .
The region is an increasingly important market for Japanese businesses , which in the past decade have been investing heavily in neighboring markets .
And as U.S. military influence declines in Asia , the Japanese government -- mindful of bitter wartime memories of Japan in the region -- has been striving to foster warmer relations by handing out billions of dollars worth of financial assistance to Asian countries .
But analysts say the strong yen works against Japan 's diplomatic push in the region .
One dollar today is worth less than 100 yen , down from 130 yen four years ago .
Most countries in the region , whose currencies are dollar-linked , are now pushing Japan to help them meet the higher cost of servicing the yen-based debt .
China has slashed its huge yen debt in favor of dollar borrowings in recent years , and a Chinese Ministry of Finance official says his country `` will negotiate with the Japanese in concrete terms to avoid further foreign exchange losses .
'' Analysts expect Indonesia , which owes 40 % of its debt in yen , to soon ask Japan to pay for Indonesian oil and lumber in yen , instead of dollars , to help it repay debt .
Many Asian countries now borrow more money directly from the Japanese government than from any other government or multilateral lending agency .
Currency considerations aside , Japanese government loans are n't a bad deal .
Asia 's poorest countries pay interest rates to Japan of less than 3 % .
Most loans can be paid back over 40 years , with no payments necessary in the first 10 years .
Japan is also one of the few countries that lends money for general budget purposes , rather than specific projects .
China was an early beneficiary .
As early as 1980 , nearly 13 % of its foreign borrowings were in yen .
By 1986 , that had swelled to 51.4 % .
While the World Bank and other countries mulled China 's move away from strict socialism , Japan quickly opened its coffers , says Nicholas Kwan , senior economist at Merrill Lynch Asia Pacific Ltd. in Hong Kong .
But as Asia 's booming economies require more capital for investment , the soaring costs of servicing yen-denominated debt are starting to hurt .
`` The yen 's appreciation has greatly heightened China 's debt burden as the country entered a peak repayment period last year , '' says an official at China 's Ministry of Finance .
Beijing continues to stress non-yen loans in its official borrowing , and has asked Chinese trading companies to avoid the yen in deals with Japanese concerns .
Instead , the official says , companies should settle accounts in such hard currencies as U.S. dollars and Swiss francs .
Indonesia faces similar problems with its huge exposure to yen borrowings .
Each 1 % increase in the yen 's value against the dollar effectively adds $ 20 million to its debt service , says Eugene Galbraith , head of brokerage firm PT HG Asia Indonesia .
Vietnam could be next .
Two years ago , Japan became one of its first hard-currency lenders since the Vietnam War .
It has since lent more to Hanoi than either the Asian Development Bank or the World Bank .
But Vietnam may find the new loans are a `` big headache for the future '' if the yen continues to appreciate , says Toru Tatara , a senior officer at the Asian Development Bank in Manila .
Vietnam 's currency risk is exacerbated by the fact that most of its exports earn U.S. dollars .
Despite such concerns , the bureaucrats who manage Japan 's foreign-aid lending seem reluctant to alter their lending terms just because the yen is strong .
`` If borrowing countries put their foreign reserves in yen , then they can profit when the yen appreciates , '' says Toshihiko Kinoshita , head of the research institute at Japan 's state-run Export-Import Bank .
Debtors should also `` export goods as much as possible denominated in yen , '' he says .
For either course to make much difference , Japan would have to reform itself , counters Kenneth S. Courtis , senior economist at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets -LRB- Asia -RRB- Ltd. , in Tokyo .
Japan pays for more than 80 % of its imports in dollars , he notes .
And Japan lacks the kind of highly liquid money market that other central banks would need to hedge large yen positions .
`` Japan is ... forcing these countries to borrow yen and buy in yen , '' Mr. Courtis says .
`` The day of reckoning will come when two or three countries in the region say , look , we ca n't continue this way anymore .

Handing the Philippine government a victory in its efforts to raise more revenue to spur economic development , the country 's supreme court let stand an expansion of the value-added tax .
The justices dismissed a host of challenges filed by legislators , private organizations and business groups .
Opponents have 15 days to file motions seeking to have the judgment reconsidered .
Coverage of the VAT , which is to replace other taxes and widen a narrow tax base , would be expanded to include sectors such as real estate , rental cars and hotels .
The government argues this is crucial to help narrow a chronic budget deficit .
Consumers had complained about rising prices even without the VAT change , while businesses worried about higher costs and effects on a recovering economy .
Even legislators who passed the measure said its scope had been widened too much by a panel that rectified differences , though many said they had n't read the final version carefully .
Japan 's government intends to craft a special spending package this year to boost the stagnant economy , said an influential legislator , Takeo Hiranuma of the Liberal Democratic Party .
A target sum has n't been discussed .
Pumping more money into the economy would be welcomed by Japan 's trading partners .
But Finance Ministry deficit hawks say a nascent recovery might not warrant extra spending .
Japan has had four stimulus packages since August 1992 that injected at least $ 152 billion into the economy , which nonetheless is expected to grow 1 % or less this year .
Mr. Hiranuma also predicted personal income-tax cuts will be extended .

In television ads , he had promised his Caritas firm would generate eightfold returns in three months .
The pitch attracted deposits of least $ 500 million from more than 2.5 million people in what authorities said was a pyramid scheme , in which high returns to early investors are paid from money from later investors .
Authorities said 119 similar firms have failed to pay back depositors since the command economy fell in 1991 .
China 's National Statistics Enforcement Office said it uncovered about 60,000 instances of false statistical reports since it began a crackdown on the problem in June .
Most bogus reports involved industrial output .
Seeking advantages or hiding failures , local officials , factory managers , rural enterprises and others have filed fake numbers on everything from production levels to birth rates .
Last week , the ruling Communist Party for the first time acknowledged false reporting was widespread .
The data agency , though , said indexes such as those on inflation and crops tended to be fairly accurate .
Pakistan 's government said it planned to expel about one million illegal immigrants from Karachi , the country 's commercial center and largest city with a population of 10 million .
Officials and welfare groups have said illegal immigration has contributed to violence , drug trafficking and other crime in Karachi .
Most immigrants are from India , Afghanistan , Bangladesh , Burma and Iran .
Karachi has been rocked by ethnic and political violence in recent years .
Russians ' disposable incomes in July rose an inflation-adjusted 11 % from a year earlier , the government said .
The increase extended this year 's trend of growing incomes , even as inflation is running at 5 % a month and production is declining .
Salaries in July averaged 224,000 rubles -LRB- $ 104 -RRB- , up 8 % from June .
But a rich-poor gap continued to widen in this year 's first seven months , as 26 % of earned income went to the top 10 % of the population and 2.4 % went to the poorest 10 % .
The richest Russians ' average income was 12 times that of the poorest ; in 1993 , this ratio was 11 to 1 , up from 8 to 1 in 1992 .
This year through July , 34 million Russians , or 23 % of the population , had incomes below the poverty line .
But these figures are widely viewed as understating actual earnings , as many Russians stick to off-the-books dealings or underreport incomes to duck taxes .

Bayer AG said pretax profit jumped 24 % in the first half , and predicted a `` substantial rise '' in full-year earnings as Europe 's chemical industry emerges from recession .
Analysts said the pretax rise to 1.75 billion marks -LRB- $ 1.13 billion -RRB- , from 1.41 billion marks a year earlier , was at the upper end of forecasts .
Lehman Brothers International analyst Martin Glen , based in London , said , `` Bayer is benefiting from a recovery in the chemical industry across Europe .
'' Sales rose in the first half by 6 % to 22.2 billion marks , from 21 billion marks a year ago .
The company noted that the chemicals segments , in particular , displayed strong signs of recovery , with sales of polymers and industrial products up 8 % .
In the health-care sector , a sales rise of 8 % was driven by demand in markets outside Germany .
The German company is the most prominent bidder for the consumer-health operations of Eastman Kodak Co. 's Sterling Winthrop unit .
The unit has owned the U.S. rights to Bayer aspirin since the end of World War I , and Bayer admits to being very eager to get the rights back .
An announcement on who clinches the deal is expected this month .
Bayer Chief Executive Officer Manfred Schneider has forecast a 15 % to 20 % rise in pretax profit for the current year .
Despite fears that rising interest rates might scare off buyers , the sales pace for existing single-family homes remained relatively firm in July compared with June and grew 2.6 % from a year earlier .
According to the National Association of Realtors , July home sales declined 0.3 % from June , bringing its seasonally adjusted annual rate to 3.95 million units .
That 's in line with many analysts ' predictions of almost four million resales this year , a 4 % rise from last year 's 3.8 million , and close to the 1978 record of 4.1 million .
Housing analysts said strong job and income growth , pent-up demand in the still recovering Northeast market and a fierce price war among mortgage lenders struggling for business all added up to better sales than some had expected -- at least for the moment .
`` The market is strong , '' said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester , Pa. `` It continues to weather the hikes in interest rates , but I think the time will come when the market will succumb to high rates .
'' Already , rates for a conventional 30-year mortgage have climbed , rising to 8.74 % Wednesday from 7.09 % a year earlier , according to HSH Associates , a mortgage publisher .
But at the same time , adjustable-rate mortgages have edged up only slightly in cost and many consumers have flocked to these loans , increasing the ARM market share to 33 % last week from 19 % a year earlier , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association .
Mr. Zandi estimates that it will be six to nine months before home resales really reflect higher interest rates , and others agree .
`` My fingers are still crossed , but I think rates will continue to rise and eventually choke this vigorous housing activity , '' said David Lereah , the chief economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association .
But John Tuccillo , the National Association of Realtors chief economist , said the Federal Reserve 's recent interest-rate increase will calm inflationary fears and actually stabilize long-term rates , spurring robust home sales .
`` We 've got strong demand ; it 's being muted by rising rates , but certainly not destroyed or killed , '' he said .
`` I think we 're in a steady state .
'' The Northeast showed the greatest year-on-year gain -- sales there grew 7.1 % .
Sales in the West increased 4.9 % , while the Midwest posted a 2.9 % gain .
The South , which has been experiencing a housing boom , actually declined 0.7 % in sales on a 0.9 % price drop .
California resales slid 8.3 % in July from June but rose 4.6 % from a year earlier , according to the California Association of Realtors .
Prices declined 2 % from a year earlier .
For the first seven months of the year , resales were up 22 % .
Foreclosure activity in California dropped to the lowest point in nearly two years , falling 15 % in July from a year earlier , according to Dataquick Information Systems in La Jolla .
Dell Computer Corp. closed the books on its derivative losses and posted solid earnings for its fiscal second quarter even after a final one-time charge for the ill-fated investment foray .
The Austin , Texas , mail-order vendor also showed signs of rejuvenation in sales after a year of rebuilding and reorganizing .
Sales grew 13 % to $ 791.5 million from $ 700.6 million as Dell earned $ 28.6 million , or 65 cents a share .
Last year in the second quarter , Dell suffered a loss of $ 75.7 million , or $ 2.03 a share .
`` We have begun to see signs of stronger revenue momentum , '' said Tom Meredith , chief financial officer .
Total sales were up 3 % from the first quarter , but when retail sales are factored out , sales in Dell 's core mail-order market grew 9 % from the first quarter , Mr. Meredith said .
Last month , Dell decided to exit the retail arena , saying it was unprofitable for the company .
The earnings were in line with analysts ' estimates .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday , Dell shares closed at $ 35.125 , unchanged .
Continued price-cutting led to a 3.6 % decline in gross profit margins to 21.4 % in the quarter ended July 31 from 22.2 % the previous quarter .
More pressure on margins is expected in the third quarter , Mr. Meredith said .
Sales of computers with Intel Corp. 's Pentium microprocessors grew to 24 % of revenue in the second quarter , up from 10 % in the first quarter .
Dell , pushing hard toward Pentium-based systems , trails rival mail-order firm Gateway 2000 Inc. in total Pentium sales in North America , according to market research data .
Notebook sales doubled from the first quarter to the second and amounted to 5 % of total revenue .
Dell withdrew from the notebook market last year , and has phased back in this year .
Initial demand for two new notebook computers introduced earlier this month is `` looking good , '' the company said .
Notebook sales can amount to 20 % to 25 % of revenue at rival computer firms .
For the first six months of the fiscal year , Dell earned $ 47.5 million , or $ 1.06 a share , on sales of $ 1.56 billion .
Last year in the same period , Dell posted losses of $ 65.5 million , or $ 1.76 a share , on sales of $ 1.37 billion .
As a result of losses in derivative investments , Dell took a charge of $ 6.2 million , or 15 cents a share , in the second quarter , ending its exposure to the risky interest-rate investments .
The company took a $ 26.3 million one-time charge in the first quarter as a result of derivative-related losses as well .
WASHINGTON -- Securities and Exchange Commissioner J. Carter Beese Jr. is resigning his post , leaving vacant the only seat on the five-member SEC currently occupied by a Republican .
Mr. Beese , who is seen as the strongest free-market advocate on the commission , said he will leave the agency `` in a couple of months '' for personal reasons and has n't decided what he will do next .
Others said Mr. Beese is likely to return to the securities industry , trading his high-visibility , $ 115,700-a-year SEC post for a lower-profile , but higher-paying , private-sector job .
People here immediately began speculating that the resignation might be used by the Clinton administration as leverage to break a political blockade that is keeping SEC Commissioner Mary Schapiro from being confirmed as chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission .
Sen. Jesse Helms -LRB- R. , N.C. -RRB- is preventing Ms. Schapiro from assuming the CFTC job because of an unrelated dispute with Agriculture Secretary Michael Espy .
Sen. Helms says he wo n't allow Ms. Schapiro 's confirmation to go through until Mr. Espy reinstates to his former job an Agriculture Department employee reassigned for allegedly making antigay remarks .
Two people familiar with the situation suggested that President Clinton might refuse to appoint another Republican to the SEC until Ms. Schapiro 's CFTC confirmation goes forward .
No more than three commission members can be from one political party .
Ms. Schapiro played down the speculation yesterday , but said : `` On the assumption that I ever do leave , it means that the commission could be a very different place a year from now .
'' Mr. Beese 's departure is n't likely to please the antiregulation executives of Wall Street 's big securities firms .
He urged , for instance , that Congress not rush to impose aggressive new regulations on the booming derivatives industry , a major Wall Street profit center .
He also used his position to explore what constraints in the Investment Company Act -- which regulates mutual funds and other investment managers -- might burden the industry .
Ms. Schapiro is the only other current commissioner nominated by a Republican , but is a political independent .
She is seen as an enforcement hawk , and lacks Mr. Beese 's securities-industry background .
Mr. Beese would n't say whether he thinks his departure will affect Ms. Schapiro .
`` I just hope that Mary Schapiro is soon confirmed for the CFTC job , '' he said .
`` It 's been over 18 months since the CFTC had a chairman , and the markets deserve better .
'' Mr. Beese , who was appointed by President Bush , has served on the SEC since March 1992 .
He has spent much of the past year traveling to foreign countries , urging them to list their stocks on U.S. financial markets .
`` I think it 's fair to say that Carter was an effective salesman of American capitalism to corporations from China to Mexico , '' SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said yesterday .
`` He made no secret of the fact that with a young family he expected to return to the private sector , '' Mr. Levitt added .
`` I think it 's likely that Carter will someday return to public life in a higher-profile position .
'' Mr. Beese came to the commission from the investment-banking firm Alex Brown & Sons , where he was a partner .
`` I think he brought a real-world perspective to the commission , '' said Marianne Smythe , former director of the SEC 's investment-management division , now a lawyer in private practice .
`` He was familiar with trading issues and market issues , and that was refreshing , because so many of those who work at the commission do n't have that background .
'' Of his efforts to sell foreign companies on U.S. financial markets , Mr. Beese said : `` The '90s are the decade of cross-border capital flows .
I share very strongly Arthur Levitt 's desire to make sure the U.S. markets remain the pre-eminent markets in what is the most competitive global environment we have ever seen .
'' Mr. Beese said he intends to use his last two months in the SEC post to continue stressing a point he has been making recently about the lack of realistic retirement planning among many Americans .
Retirement systems now in place , he asserts , do n't encourage people to plan actively for a comfortable retirement .
`` If current trends stay in place , the average retirement living standard of American families will fall dramatically in the next few decades , '' Mr. Beese said .
`` Personally , I think it 's a bigger problem than the federal deficit .
'' CHICAGO -- With the corn and soybean shortage nearly over in the U.S. , the grain markets are focusing on the tight wheat situation in the world .

Earlier this week , the Canadian government said it expects the spring wheat crop there to shrink 25 % from last year .
China , Russia , Turkey and Saudi Arabia are all expected to produce less wheat this year .
The London-based International Wheat Council projected yesterday that the world wheat crop this year will shrink 4 % to 536 million metric tons from the 559 million metric tons harvested last year .
The council represents grain-producing and grain-importing nations .
Some traders expected world wheat production to fall as low as 530 million metric tons as crop damage becomes clearer in China , where drought and floods reportedly have ravaged tens of millions of acres of farmland .
The forecast , which is about six million metric tons lower than the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's outlook , helped lift the price of many wheat futures contracts to life-of-contract highs at Midwest exchanges .
In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade , the soft red winter wheat contract for December delivery climbed 8.25 cents a bushel to settle at $ 3.7125 a bushel .
The December spring wheat contract at the Minneapolis Grain Exchange jumped a dime a bushel while the December hard red winter wheat contract at the Kansas City Board of Trade climbed nine cents a bushel .
The decline in world wheat production could signal a rebound in moribund U.S. wheat exports because it is one of the few countries reaping an ample harvest this year .
U.S. farmers , which have completed the winter wheat harvest and now are cutting spring wheat in the Northern Plains , are expected to produce 2.39 billion bushels this year , or 64.9 million metric tons .
That is about flat compared with last year .
One metric ton of what equals 36.74 bushels .
How much wheat the U.S. exports , however , depends in large part on whether economically ailing customers such as Russia can arrange financing or aid .
Some traders figure that about 1.28 billion bushels of this year 's U.S. wheat production might be exported , up roughly 100 million bushels from earlier estimates , if cash becomes available .
The U.S. controls about one-third of the world wheat trade .
Some traders figure the combination of rising exports and tightening world supplies could lift the price of a bushel of U.S. wheat to $ 4.25 this winter .
The amount of wheat left over before the world 's 1995 harvests is expected to be 114 million metric tons , the lowest since 1982 .
That ending stockpile is the world 's buffer against crop failure .
As a percentage of world consumption , that cushion might become the thinnest since the 1970s , traders said yesterday .
The council said it expects China , the world 's largest wheat producer , to import about seven million metric tons through mid-1995 to satisfy domestic demand .
That would be up 52 % from the recently ended period , when China imported the lowest amount of wheat in 16 years .
The council expects the former Soviet Union to harvest 72.2 million metric tons of wheat this year , down about 11 million metric tons from last year 's production .
While U.S. wheat prices are climbing , corn and soybean prices have sunk on prospects for bumper U.S. harvests in several weeks .
Those harvests will refill bins drained by last year 's flood-related crop disaster in the Midwest .
The council expects world corn production to climb 15 % this year to 533 million metric tons , mostly because a bigger U.S. corn crop is on the horizon .
In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade , the corn contract for September delivery slipped 1.75 cents a bushel to settle at $ 2.2175 a bushel .
COFFEE : Coffee prices moved higher in response to a report confirming a recent USDA survey that found substantial frost damage to Brazil 's coffee crop .
Coffee for September delivery on New York 's Coffee , Cocoa and Sugar Exchange rose 2.75 cents to $ 1.9175 a pound .
Steven Platt , senior analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago , said the German statistical firm F.O. Licht released a report putting Brazil 's 1995-96 harvest at 18.5 million bags .
That figure is in line with recent data from the USDA , which came in much lower than the USDA 's prefrost estimate of 29 million bags .
In addition to the freezes , Brazil 's harvest also is threatened by fresh worries about dry weather .
`` The concern about the crop is how will it recover from the freeze given the dry conditions , '' Mr. Platt said .
`` We still have quite a bullish scenario for the coffee market .
'' PLATINUM : Platinum prices rose despite evidence of declines in orders for autos , which use the metal in catalytic converters .
Platinum for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $ 1 to $ 415.70 an ounce .
The Commerce Department 's report on orders for durable goods , released Wednesday , showed a sharp decline in orders for transportation equipment , largely due to a two-week shutdown at auto factories .
But traders responded instead to signs of a pickup in demand for platinum and to concerns about supplies , especially from Russia .
Analysts said they notice some increased platinum buying by the Japanese .
George Milling-Stanley , precious-metals analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York , said he was encouraged the platinum market failed to weaken on news this week that Nissan had developed a catalyst that uses palladium rather than platinum .
He said the market often swings wildly on such reports , fearing a decline in platinum demand .
But he noted that similar developments with the use of palladium have often proved to have only limited applications .
`` The market was singularly unmoved by the Nissan report , '' Mr. Milling-Stanley said .
`` For once , the market took it in its stride .

Service Fracturing Co. , Pampa , Texas , said it agreed to merge with Canadian-based Nowsco Well Service Ltd. .
Under the agreement , Nowsco will offer to buy all of Service Fracturing 's outstanding shares for $ 4.55 each , or about $ 25.2 million .
The offer will be subject to certain conditions , including the tender of at least two-thirds of Service Fracturing 's outstanding common shares on a fully diluted basis , the company said .
Service Fracturing provides oilfield-stimulation services similar to those offered by Nowsco and operates in North Texas , Kansas , Oklahoma and Colorado .
Nowsco , which operates internationally , has only one service area that overlaps with Service Fracturing 's .
Service Fracturing said the tender offer is expected to begin within five business days .
The company has about 5,540,000 common shares outstanding .
Pancontinental Mining Ltd. , an Australian gold , zinc , lead , copper and coal mining company , said its profit after taxes rose 4.8 % to 10.5 million Australian dollars -LRB- $ 7.8 million -RRB- for the fiscal year ended June 30 .
Pancontinental 's profit included an abnormal or unusual tax benefit of A$ 1.4 million .
Lindsay MacAlister , managing director of Pancontinental , said the company achieved its profit despite a decline during the year in average prices of all commodities produced by the company except for gold .
He said cash flow from operating activities rose slightly , to A$ 69.8 million from A$ 68.3 million a year earlier .
Sales rose 3.1 % to A$ 239.5 million , mainly because of higher shipments of base-metal concentrates and magnesia .
Pancontinental also said it raised A$ 38.9 million through a share placement .
WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency proposed a tougher system for regulating the testing of certain biotechnology products .
Under the proposed procedure , researchers who seek to release into the environment micro-organisms that were formed by combining genetic material from different families of organisms must submit formal applications to the EPA 60 days in advance .
The EPA would approve the applications only if it finds the new micro-organisms do n't present an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment .
A similar review procedure , but with applications required 90 days in advance , would precede manufacture or import of such products .
The EPA said the new procedures would cost industry as much as $ 2.2 million in the first year of implementation .
But it added that the costs would drop after industry becomes more accustomed to the procedures .
In the fifth year after implementation , it estimates , the procedures would cost as much as $ 460,000 .
The rules were proposed under the Toxic Substances Control Act , which regulates all biotech products except food , drugs and pesticides .
The EPA currently requests , but does n't require , notification of field trials for the biotechnologically derived microorganisms .
Manufacture of certain microorganisms , principally enzymes , that are commonly used to make specialty chemicals would be exempt from the new procedures .
Micro-organisms that are tested in contained structures such as laboratories and greenhouses also would be exempt , although researchers in such facilities would be required to keep records of their activities .
The agency said it will be about a year before the rules are issued in final form .
Separately , the EPA published a final rule aimed at reducing regulation of the testing of microbial pesticides under the Federal Insecticide , Fungicide and Rodenticide Act .
Under the regulation , the only pesticides that will be subject to notification requirements are ones determined by the EPA to pose a relatively large risk to people or the environment .
LOS ANGELES -- David Evans , who had been president of News Corp. 's Fox Circle Productions , was named president and chief operating officer of Fox Television .
News Corp. created the Fox Television unit last month , and named Chase Carey chairman and chief executive officer , overseeing the Fox television network , Fox Television Stations , Twentieth Television Domestic Distribution and Fox 's cable operations .
The heads of those divisions will continue to report to Mr. Carey , with Mr. Evans in charge of coordinating the various television operations .
Mr. Evans , 54 years old , had been president , international , for British Sky Broadcasting , which is partly owned by News Corp. .
TOKYO -- Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. , showing signs of shaking off a painful slump , reported a 12 % rise in pretax profit for its fiscal first quarter on its first sales increase in three years .
Matsushita , one of the world 's largest consumer-electronics companies , said group pretax profit for the three months ended June 30 rose to 37.6 billion yen -LRB- $ 380 million -RRB- from 33.7 billion yen a year earlier .
Group sales were 1.642 trillion yen , up 3 % from 1.596 trillion yen a year ago .
Analysts hailed the performance as further evidence of Matsushita 's success at streamlining operations , particularly compared with rival Sony Corp. `` There 's a lot of cost-cutting there , '' said Joseph Osha , an analyst with Baring Securities -LRB- Japan -RRB- Ltd. .
Matsushita `` has made a lot more progress on cost-cutting than Sony , although they had more to do .
'' The results also suggest that many of Matsushita 's core markets , long suffering from weak demand , are showing signs of life .
Its sales of information products and industrial equipment jumped 14 % to 434.1 billion yen , primarily on the strength of personal-computer-related items such as hard-disk drives and CD-ROM drives .
Similarly , sales of audio equipment advanced 4 % , to 130.3 billion yen , while electronic components such as semiconductors rose 3 % to 210.3 billion yen .
Matsushita sells products under the National , Panasonic , Quasar , Technics and JVC brand names .
Matsushita 's entertainment sales , largely from its MCA Inc. movie unit , fell 2 % to 127.9 billion yen .
Matsushita cited the effect of the strong yen , which reduces the yen-denominated value of overseas sales .
In local-currency terms , undistorted by the yen 's value , MCA reported a 16 % increase in sales , largely on the success of Steven Spielberg 's film `` Schindler 's List , '' Matsushita said .
Matsushita said it even saw signs of recovery in the sluggish Japanese market .
The company registered increased sales of household appliances and air conditioners in Japan , a spokesman said .
Some analysts expect a recovery in Japan to power a major increase in Matsushita 's earnings in the next few years .
`` We 're in for a major surprise , '' said David Benda , an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research -LRB- Japan -RRB- Ltd. , who says demand for replacement television sets and videocassette recorders in Japan should pick up next year .
TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. , Japan 's largest auto maker , will soon announce substantial price increases on vehicles sold in North America to reflect the yen 's sharp rise against the dollar , a company official said .
The increases , which will be announced in the next few weeks , will `` match the full amount of the yen 's appreciation , '' said Toyota finance manager Ryuji Araki .
`` Unless we do that , we are likely to be criticized for dumping , '' he said .
Dumping is the sale of a product in a foreign market at a price lower than the domestic price .
Honda Motor Co. , another big Japanese auto maker , said this week it will likely increase prices of exports to the U.S. Mr. Araki would n't specify what period of the yen 's rise the price increase would reflect , though he noted that the dollar had slid this year from 110 yen to below 98 yen .
The dollar was quoted at 99.70 yen yesterday in late New York trading .
If the past is any indication , Toyota 's price increases will be spread among both pricey exports , such as its Celica sports car and its Lexus luxury line , as well as U.S.-made models such as the Camry .
Though the Big Three American auto makers have also raised prices on some vehicles in advance of the 1995 model year , a significant jump in Toyota 's prices would likely hurt its standing in the U.S. market .
Through July , Toyota 's share of the U.S. passenger car market was 8.4 % , down from 8.8 % a year ago .
Likewise , Toyota 's share of the light-truck market dropped , slipping to a 4.9 % share from 5.3 % a year ago .
At the same time , Toyota 's profit has been hurt by the sharp rise in the yen .
Yesterday Toyota said unconsolidated pretax profit for the fiscal year ended June 30 skidded for the fourth year in a row , plunging 25 % to 214 billion yen -LRB- $ 2.16 billion -RRB- from 286.5 billion yen a year earlier .
Sales fell nearly 10 % to 8.16 trillion yen .
Because of the yen 's appreciation , more dollars are required to generate the same amount of yen for Japanese product makers .
The unfavorable exchange rate took 160 billion yen , or about $ 1.6 billion , off of Toyota 's earnings in the latest fiscal year .
As a result , Toyota , like other Japanese exporters , has been trying to cut yen-denominated costs while boosting overseas production , including increasing capacity at its Georgetown , Ky. , site .
Its overall exports fell 8 % in the most recent fiscal year , while overseas production climbed about 19 % .
Automobiles constitute the largest component of America 's merchandise trade deficit with Japan , which widened in July despite the stronger yen .
Increased U.S. imports were fueled by the U.S. recovery as well as surging demand for autos .
Toyota said sales in Japan -- the company 's largest market -- fell 7 % to two million vehicles , while overseas sales fell by 8 % , to 2.1 million units .
On a consolidated basis , Toyota 's pretax profit skidded 27 % to 236.5 billion yen from 322.2 billion yen , while sales fell 8.3 % to 9.4 trillion yen .
Separately , Toyota announced that its octogenarian former chairman , Eiji Toyoda , is leaving the company 's board .
Mr. Toyoda , the cousin of the car company 's founder , is an engineer who joined Toyota before World War II .
Analysts applauded the company 's cost-cutting efforts .
They said the austerity not only prevented further profit declines but helped the company rebound from the first half of the year , which now seems to have been its nadir .
`` It looks like things are bottoming out , '' said Peter Boardman , analyst at UBS Securities .
In the second half of the fiscal year , the company 's operating margins improved to 1.6 % from 0.23 % in the first half .
The cost-cutting resulted in a savings of about 150 billion yen in the year ended June 30 , and Toyota is aiming to shave 100 billion yen more of expenses in the current fiscal year .
The savings last year were realized through improved design and reduced parts variations .
For example , the number of parts in Toyota 's new Camry Vista in Japan was cut to 2,300 from 3,900 , while the number of variations between the new and old model was reduced to 44 from 66 .
Toyota has also achieved savings by requiring suppliers to cut prices 15 % over the next three years .
Toyota is optimistic about the current fiscal year .
It expects its domestic unit sales to rebound by 7.5 % , spurred by its new Camry , RAV4 and Celica models .
Orders for the new Camry Vista in Japan are running at double forecasts , while a RAV4 sports-utility vehicle ordered today wo n't be available until November .
For the first half of the current fiscal year , Toyota forecasts that its parent group 's pretax profit will hit 130 billion yen , its net profit 60 billion yen and sales of 4.1 trillion yen .
Toyota also plans to change its fiscal year to end on March 31 , like most Japanese companies .
For the nine month period ending in March 1995 , the company expects to report pretax profit of 200 billion yen on sales of 6.2 trillion yen .
WELLESLEY , Mass. -- EG&G Inc. said it wo n't bid to renew a contract to manage the U.S. Department of Energy 's facility at the Nevada Test Site .
The company , which earlier said it was considering phasing out its Energy Department contract-management business , said its latest move is `` consistent with a re-examination of its varied business segments .
'' EG&G 's two current contracts at the Nevada Test Site expire Dec. 31 , 1995 .
EG&G 's contract at the Nevada Test Site , where it runs nuclear-bomb testing facilities , contributes revenue of as much as $ 600 million a year .
EG&G earlier said it would n't seek to renew a contract to manage the Energy Department 's Rocky Flats , Colo. , facility .
EG&G also recently lost its bid for the $ 5 billion management contract at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory .
In an earlier announcement , the company said Energy Department contracting is less attractive to it because the department has changed its bidding requirements in ways that force the company to invest more resources and management time and assume greater potential liabilities .
The company also said it may get out of the Energy Department contract-management business after 1995 , `` conceivably '' cutting its annual revenue to about $ 1.5 billion from $ 2.7 billion last year .
EG&G makes instruments , mechanical parts and optoelectronics and performs technical-service contracting .
WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Life Partners Inc. , the biggest of about 30 companies that buy and sell the life-insurance policies of terminally ill people , accusing it of illegally trafficking in securities .
The SEC 's lawsuit , filed in U.S. District Court against the company and its president , Brian Pardo , challenges the company 's practice of grouping together the life-insurance policies of AIDS patients and selling them to investors .
Mr. Pardo denied the SEC 's allegations and said , `` I think the SEC is attempting to overstep its jurisdictional boundaries .
'' Some people in rival businesses say that the SEC action is likely to chill the fast-growing industry that has sprung up to broker these `` viatical settlements , '' as they are known in the trade .
`` This could push Life Partners and other brokers like them out of the business , '' said John Banks , chief executive officer of Viaticus Inc. , a unit of Chicago-based CNA Financial Corp. and a Life Partners competitor .
`` I do n't know that they can deal with the kind of reporting requirements the SEC is going to require .
'' In viatical settlements , investors pay fractions of the face value of life-insurance policies to the patients , who use the money to benefit from the insurance coverage before they die .
Firms such as Life Partners act as brokers in the transactions , collecting commissions of 3 % to 5 % of the sale price .
When the patient dies , the investor collects the face value of the insurance policy from the insurance company .
The sooner the patient dies , the greater the investor 's profit .
There are two kinds of companies in the viatical settlement business : Those that act as brokers and those that buy viatical settlements in proprietary transactions to hold in their portfolios .
Life Partners is of the former type ; Viaticus is of the latter .
The SEC 's case alleges that Life Partners and Mr. Pardo `` offer and sell unregistered securities that consist of interests , packaged in various forms , in death benefits to be paid under life insurance policies on the lives of persons with AIDS and other terminal illnesses .
'' The lawsuit seeks to stop Life Partners and Mr. Pardo from selling any more insurance policies and to force them to disgorge all profits they have earned in such sales .
In an interview , Mr. Pardo said it 's immaterial whether the SEC likes the business of viatical settlements .
`` What is material , '' he said , `` is that they have no jurisdiction to be regulating it , because they have n't proved these are securities in any way shape or form .
'' Joseph Goldstein , associate director of the SEC 's enforcement division , said the agency is n't trying to mount an attack on the viatical settlement business in general .
`` This case is about one company and the product that it is selling and does not represent an effort by the commission to attack viatical settlements per se , '' Mr. Goldstein said .
The SEC 's case is complicated by the fact that many AIDS-advocate groups do n't believe there is anything wrong with what companies like Life Partners are doing .
`` I believe that these companies provide a valuable service for people with AIDS , '' said Bill Freeman , executive director of the National Association of People with AIDS .
Of the SEC 's suit , Mr. Freeman said : `` I think it 's contemptible .
'' The SEC suit also accuses Mr. Pardo of failing to appropriately disclose to the company 's investors information about his past run-ins with federal regulators .
In 1989 , the SEC accused Mr. Pardo of financial fraud in overstating the financial results of ASK Corp. , a Texas maker of solar-utility systems at which he was chief executive .
Without admitting or denying wrongdoing , Mr. Pardo settled the case by pledging not to violate securities laws .
DETROIT -- The 10 domestic auto makers said they plan to build 214,265 cars and trucks this week , an increase of 17 % from the 182,642 vehicles built a year earlier .
General Motors Corp. will fall short of its production plans this week because of a labor strike at a parts plant in Anderson , Ind. , that idled 13 of its assembly plants as of late yesterday .
Rentokil Group PLC announced a 20 % rise in pretax profit for the first half and said it sees continued growth for the full year .
The British company , which operates through Europe and North America , offers business services such as pest control , tropical-plant rental and maintenance , and sanitary and security services .
Profit attributable to Rentokil shareholders , after accounting for tax and minority interests , rose 21 % to # 51.7 million -LRB- $ 80.3 million -RRB- .
In the United Kingdom , Rentokil 's revenue rose 68 % to # 157.1 million .
North American revenue more than doubled to # 61 million .
NEW YORK -- The criteria for the first Broadway musical to play Beijing are simple enough : no cursing , no sex , no politics , and all-American .
But that 's enough to eliminate such hits as `` Kiss of the Spider Woman , '' `` Les Miserables , '' `` Miss Saigon , '' and `` Tommy .
'' From the handful that made the cut , said New York lawyer John Wood , who is helping organize the venture , project organizers settled on `` Crazy for You , '' a musical chock with 1930s-vintage George Gershwin hits that are more American than apple pie .
`` In essence , it had to be wholesome , which by our standards , threw us back to the 1950s , '' Mr. Wood said .
He said he and Xiong Chi , president of Moraga International , an Issaquah , Wash.-based export company , have received approval from Chinese government officials to bring the play in December to Beijing and Shanghai for several shows and a nationwide television broadcast .
The musical will also be performed in Hong Kong .
China has seen a few small-scale productions of American musicals in years past , as well as a stream of classical musicians and pop stars , according to the New York-based Center for United States & China Arts Exchange .
This effort , however , would be the first big-budget Broadway production , and the first to be televised nationally .
The Tony Award-winning play , which opened on Broadway in 1992 , is the story of a banker 's son sent to foreclose on a theater in a mining town in Nevada , who falls in love with a local girl and rescues the theater .
It is laced with popular Gershwin songs .
The Chinese government Performing Arts Agency , said Mr. Chi , approved the plan after reviewing the script and listening to the soundtrack .
Although it is unclear whether the constraints on the play 's content were required by the Chinese government , Mr. Chi , as a former Chinese government official , is familiar with the government 's sensibilities , according to people familiar with the venture .
`` We like Gershwin , '' said Mr. Chi .
`` He is renowned among the Chinese people .
` Crazy for You ' is light .
It can be enjoyed by the whole family .
It has traditional values .
'' Mr. Wood said that after screening a number of plays himself , he took Mr. Chi , who had never seen a Broadway musical , to `` Crazy for You '' and `` Guys and Dolls .
'' New York entertainment lawyer James Lightstone , who is also involved in the venture , said Mr. Chi 's first response to `` Crazy for You '' was : `` Can we just pick it up and take it over ?
'' It was n't quite that easy .
Fortunately , a touring company performing the show in Germany was free in December .
So a new company , Far East Entertainment Productions Ltd. was formed , and the name `` Broadway in Beijing '' was trademarked .
After receiving clearance from the Chinese government , the company secured the cooperation of the producers , Roger Horchow and Elizabeth Williams .
`` Obviously , it 's thrilling , the notion of going to China , '' said Ms. Williams .
`` It 's unusual for a Broadway show to be involved in geo-politics .
'' The company is now approaching American firms about underwriting the three-week tour for some 150 people and tons of equipment , which Mr. Wood estimates will cost about $ 9 million .
At the suggestion of the Chinese government , the venture has begun contacting more than 20 companies already doing business in China , including General Motors Corp. , AT&T Corp. , American Express Co. , Eastman Kodak Co. , McDonald 's Corp. , and General Electric Co. .
In exchange for financing , said Mr. Wood , the sponsors will have the opportunity to advertise to the vast audience expected for the Chinese television broadcast , as well as the chance to meet senior government officials .
Notes Ms. Williams : `` The advertising thing on television -- it 's very entrepreneurial for the government to get involved in this capitalistic a venture .
'' LONDON -- Tomkins PLC , a British industrial management company , said that the current year ending April 29 , 1995 , has `` started well '' and that it intends to increase the total ordinary dividend for the year .
Tomkins said it would boost its dividend by `` not less '' than 15.2 % , to at least 8.5 pence -LRB- 13.2 cents -RRB- a share from 7.4 pence a share in the previous fiscal year .
Tomkins operates in a range of businesses , from lawn mowers to bread making .
Other assets include U.S. small-arms maker Smith & Wesson .
At the end of the fiscal first quarter , order books on average are ahead of the same period last year and trading profit is `` also comfortably ahead , benefiting from particularly strong performance in the U.S. '' The company said , `` The pace of economic recovery in the U.K. is still varied , but we are pleased with the results of the food sectors , which are ahead of the prior year .
'' The company said its dividend would rise because of its trading performance and strong cash generation , and as an incentive to convertible preference shareholders to convert into ordinary shares .
Tomkins shares rose four pence on the dividend news , to 245 pence , on the London Stock Exchange .
LONDON -- Latvia 's budget defict for the first seven months of the year totaled 25.3 million lats -LRB- $ 46.3 million -RRB- , the Baltic News Service reported .
Government revenue for the period totaled 303.6 million lats while expenditures totaled 326 million lats , BNS said .
The agency did not explain the source of the additional 2.9 million-lat deficit .
The agency said the 25.3 million-lat deficit had been financed by 15.7 million lats in Treasury bills and 9.6 million lats in loans from the Bank of Latvia , the country 's central bank .
Hey there , corporate director .
Looking for someone to run your entertainment company ?
We know a guy who 's super-creative , a little argumentative and maybe a tad overconcerned about details .
If you hire Jeffrey Katzenberg , that 's the man you 'd get .
Mr. Katzenberg , rebuffed in his bid to be named president of Walt Disney Co. , said Wednesday he plans to resign as chairman of Walt Disney Studios when his contract expires at the end of next month .
The decision came immediately after Chairman Michael Eisner declined to expand Mr. Katzenberg 's duties .
Mr. Eisner viewed Mr. Katzenberg as an operating man , not a strategist , and apparently felt that Mr. Katzenberg 's talents were too similar to his own to benefit him in an executive-suite partnership .
Mr. Katzenberg 's resume is impressive , and he is credited with turning around Disney 's moribund feature-film division .
This year , for example , Disney films , led by `` The Lion King , '' will take in about $ 1 billion at the U.S. box office , becoming the first company ever to achieve that benchmark .
But the numbers do n't show his real strengths , people who work with him say .
Known for a searing intensity , Mr. Katzenberg is a perfectionist with a kind of unrelenting energy that colleagues say is contagious .
`` He made us feel like the top fighter pilots in the business , '' says one former Disney executive .
If there 's a bit of an arrogant swagger that comes with that , then so be it , he adds .
`` He 's an incredible worker and he 's totally focused .
Those two things distringuish him from anybody else , '' says Bill Mechanic , president of Twentieth Century Fox and the former home-video chief at Disney .
Not everyone likes him .
He has feuded off and on with powerful talent agent Michael Ovitz , who is a close friend of Mr. Eisner , for years .
A college drop-out , Mr. Katzenberg is sometimes regarded as coarse and unpolished ; that hurt his perception among some at Disney , who did n't think he had the breadth and wisdom to be president of the entire company .
He alienated some in Hollywood with tough costcutting measures , and the one time he deviated from that strategy with the expensive `` Dick Tracy , '' he did public penance in his now-legendary `` Katzenberg memo , '' which called for a new cost consciousness in Hollywood .
Nevertheless , Hollywood 's leading entertainment executives say Mr. Katzenberg has an innate sense of story-telling .
His contributions to restoring the Walt Disney Pictures animated film franchise are attributed to his keen understanding of character , story points and emotions .
Though some chafed at how Mr. Katzenberg became publicly associated with these films , animators concede that their former boss helped make Disney 's animated movies different from all other animated features .
Moreover , he has mostly excellent relationships with actors and film-makers -LRB- despite the occasional public complaints of actors like Robin Williams who say that Disney is cheap -RRB- and is currently the studio 's main contact with Robert Redford , director of its upcoming film `` Quiz Show , '' a film about the 1950s quiz-show scandals .
As a manager , he is regarded as a shrewd leader .
In the last several months , for example , he masterminded a plan to re-engineer the film 's marketing department , which some people in Hollywood say was faltering under the strain of its new 60-movies-a-year plan .
The plan , which Mr. Katzenberg put on hold when questions about his future at the company became more serious , was to involve assigning separate people to handle the marketing and publicity chores for Disney 's Touchstone , Hollywood and Walt Disney Pictures banners .
The goal was to turn out better campaigns -- and to ease the burden on already overworked employees .
For years , Mr. Katzenberg has been criticized as being too involved in details at the studio .
People who work there say he 's pulled back recently and now does n't insist on approving every TV commercial , for example .
But his presence is still felt on any kind of significant marketing plan , and rivals say the Disney marketing machine may well be hobbled without him .
`` The department had its problems , but still you admired it , '' says the marketing chief of a rival studio .
`` It wo n't be the same kind of machine now .
It ca n't be .
'' Mr. Katzenberg is something of an unusual commodity in Hollywood in that a large number of his employees say they really like him .
His style is to roam the halls in jeans and a trademark white oxford-cloth button-down shirt , shouting hellos , by name , to many lower-level staffers .
He remembers the birthdays of colleagues with expensive gifts .
This is n't to say Mr. Katzenberg is a softie .
Associates say the perfectionist in him frequently makes him a hard-driving , ruthless and sometimes annoying boss .
The word at the studio is that its next big animated film , `` Pocahontas , '' is currently behind schedule .
It 's set to open next June .
The big question is , What will Mr. Katzenberg want to do next ?
Industry executives reason that his bid for the presidency at Disney clearly indicates that he 's interested in a corporate role and that a line job making movies would n't be nearly enough .
Some wonder if Mr. Katzenberg , a proven `` creative '' executive , is the kind of visionary or strategic thinker that companies prize as a chief executive .
Babbage 's Inc. and Software Etc. .
Stores Inc. agreed to merge into a specialty software retailer with $ 500 million in annual revenue and greater clout to compete with mass merchants and computer superstores .
Both companies , which primarily run small , bookstore-like operations in shopping malls , have suffered market-share declines in the past year as bigger retailers have broadened their software offerings .
Babbage 's and Software Etc. specialize in programs for video game players and home computers .
Shareholders in Dallas-based Babbage 's will receive 1.3 shares of the new , as-yet unnamed holding company for every share of Babbage 's stock they own .
Shareholders in Minneapolis-based Software Etc. will receive one share in the combined company for each Software Etc. share and will own about 54 % of the stock in the new company .
`` The combined company will be in a much stronger competitive position , '' said James B. McCurry , chairman of Babbage 's , who will become chairman of the combined firm .
`` Two plus two will at least equal five .
'' Mr. McCurry said the new company , which will probably be based in Dallas , will be better able to compete on price by combining administrative and distribution functions and by attaining greater buying leverage .
Only 10 % of the combined company 's 700 stores would overlap in the same shopping mall , he said , and no stores will be closed .
Each chain will continue to operate under its existing name .
In Nasdaq Stock Market trading , Babbage 's gained $ 1.25 , or 11 % , to $ 13 while Software Etc. added $ 1 , or 11 % , to $ 10 .
The combined company will have about 15 million shares outstanding , and a market value of about $ 150 million , based on yesterday 's closing prices .
Analysts applauded the merger as a way to regain momentum after a run of declining comparable-store sales and widening losses .
`` This merger is very astute .
There are a lot of economies here , '' said Lewis H. Alton of L.H. Alton & Co. .
Robertson Stephens & Co. analyst Keith Benjamin upgraded both stocks to buy from `` market performer '' after the merger was announced .
`` Bigger in this market is going to be better , '' he said .
Next year , with new game-playing platforms coming out and a continued boom in multimedia titles for home computers , `` these two companies have a money-making opportunity that 's phenomenal , '' Mr. Benjamin predicted .
Both companies showed losses in the first six months of their fiscal years , which ended July 30 , as a result of declines in same-store sales -- sales at stores open at least a year .
Babbage 's loss widened to $ 3.1 million , or 58 cents a share , from a year-earlier loss of $ 695,000 , or 13 cents a share .
Software Etc. posted a first-half loss of $ 1.7 million , or 21 cents a share , compared with a year-earlier profit of $ 683,000 , or nine cents a share , after a $ 1.4 million accounting gain .
The board of the new firm will consist of an equal number of directors from each company .
Software Etc. .
Chairman Leonard Riggio will become chairman of the executive committee of the new company and a director , the companies said .
Daniel A. DeMatteo , president of Software Etc. and Gary M. Kusin , president of Babbage 's , will continue in their current roles .
The merger , if approved by the boards and shareholders of both companies , is expected to close within 60 days , Mr. McCurry said .
Michael Jon Spencer knows all about easy come , easy go .
Mr. Spencer was in desperate need of some fast cash this summer .
His not-for-profit company , Hospital Audiences Inc. , needed a $ 200,000 cash infusion after , he says , bureaucratic red tape delayed the receipt of a $ 260,599 initial advance from a New York City agency .
Hospital Audiences uses the funds to provide access to New York art events for people with mental and physical disabilities .
The group 's outings include trips to the Bronx Museum , Broadway shows and the Metropolitan Opera in the Parks .
